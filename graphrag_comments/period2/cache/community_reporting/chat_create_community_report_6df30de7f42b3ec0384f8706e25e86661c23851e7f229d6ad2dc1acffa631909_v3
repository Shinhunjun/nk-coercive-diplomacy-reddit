The U.S. has been actively engaged in efforts to denuclearize North Korea, imposing sanctions and maintaining a military presence in the region to counter perceived threats from North Korea's missile and nuclear programs. This involvement reflects the U.S.'s commitment to regional security and its strategic alliances with South Korea and Japan, which are crucial in addressing North Korea's military ambitions.
