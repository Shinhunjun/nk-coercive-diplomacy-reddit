It has been instrumental in addressing global challenges, including the imposition of sanctions on nations that threaten international peace. A significant example of this is the U.N.'s sanctions against North Korea, which aim to curb the country's oil imports and limit its nuclear capabilities. These sanctions reflect the U.N.'s commitment to maintaining global stability and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The U.N.'s actions are crucial in fostering diplomatic relations and ensuring compliance with international laws.
