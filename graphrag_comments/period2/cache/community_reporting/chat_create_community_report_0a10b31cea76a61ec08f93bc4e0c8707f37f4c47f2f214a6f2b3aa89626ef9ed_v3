However, the country paradoxically imports nuclear energy from France, raising questions about the effectiveness and sustainability of its energy policies. This reliance on imported nuclear power has contributed to rising energy prices in Germany, complicating its energy landscape and leading to public debate about energy security and policy coherence. The relationship between Germany and France regarding energy imports illustrates the complexities of national policies in a globalized energy market.
