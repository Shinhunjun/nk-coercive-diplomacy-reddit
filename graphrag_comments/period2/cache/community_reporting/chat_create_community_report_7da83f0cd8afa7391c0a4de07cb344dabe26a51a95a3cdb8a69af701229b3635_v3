His administration's direct engagement with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un marked a significant shift from previous strategies that relied heavily on sanctions and military posturing. The historic summits, particularly the one held in Hanoi, were aimed at addressing North Korea's nuclear program and fostering dialogue. Trump's approach was characterized by a willingness to negotiate directly with Kim, which was unprecedented and drew both support and criticism domestically and internationally.
