These sanctions have a profound impact on North Korea's economy by limiting its access to resources, which has led to significant food shortages within the country. The sanctions specifically target trade and economic activities, effectively curtailing North Korea's ability to engage in international commerce and obtain necessary goods and services. This situation creates a complex dynamic where the sanctions are intended to pressure North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions while simultaneously exacerbating humanitarian issues within the country.

These sanctions restrict inter-Korean economic projects, limiting the operational capabilities of the plant and affecting the livelihoods of workers involved. The plant serves as a symbol of cooperation between North and South Korea, and its restrictions highlight the broader implications of sanctions on diplomatic relations and economic collaboration.

The restrictions complicate efforts to promote tourism in the region, which has historically been a means of fostering inter-Korean dialogue and cooperation.
