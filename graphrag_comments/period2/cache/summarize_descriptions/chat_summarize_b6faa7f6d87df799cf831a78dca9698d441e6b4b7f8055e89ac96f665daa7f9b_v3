This policy has been a central theme in negotiations between North Korea and the United States, reflecting ongoing diplomatic efforts to address the security concerns posed by North Korea's nuclear capabilities.\n\nThe concept of denuclearization encompasses various aspects, including the reduction or complete elimination of nuclear weapons from North Korea. It has been a significant point of discussion in international negotiations, with the United States demanding commitments from North Korea to dismantle its nuclear arsenal. The policy aims not only to eliminate existing nuclear weapons but also to prevent the development of new nuclear capabilities.\n\nDenuclearization has been a focal point in U.S.-North Korea relations, particularly during high-profile summits and discussions involving leaders from both nations. The negotiations have often been characterized by a complex interplay of promises and accusations, with North Korea sometimes using its nuclear program as leverage in diplomatic talks. Despite the pledges made by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to pursue denuclearization, progress has been limited, and the issue remains contentious.\n\nThe policy of denuclearization is not only a bilateral concern between the U.S. and North Korea but also involves broader international implications, as other countries and organizations monitor the situation closely. The goal is to achieve a comprehensive agreement that ensures the complete removal of nuclear weapons from North Korea, thereby enhancing regional and global security.\n\nIn summary, denuclearization refers to the multifaceted policy aimed at eliminating nuclear weapons from North Korea, which has been a critical topic in negotiations with the United States and other international stakeholders. The process involves complex diplomatic efforts, with the ultimate aim of achieving a nuclear-free North Korea.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 339, "prompt_tokens": 1296, "total_tokens": 1635, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
