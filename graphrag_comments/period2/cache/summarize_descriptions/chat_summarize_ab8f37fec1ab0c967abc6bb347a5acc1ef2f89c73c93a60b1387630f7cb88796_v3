Both nations have significant interests in East Asia, where military presence and defense strategies are critical points of concern. The US has been actively involved in ensuring the defense of Taiwan, which China views as a breakaway province, leading to heightened tensions between the two powers.\n\nTrade relations between the US and China are also fraught with challenges.
