Established in the early 18th century BCE, Baekje was known for its cultural achievements and military prowess. Throughout its existence, the kingdom actively sought alliances with foreign powers to counter various threats, particularly from neighboring kingdoms and emerging stronger powers in the region.\n\nDespite its efforts to forge strategic partnerships, Baekje faced numerous challenges that ultimately led to its downfall. The kingdom struggled with maintaining these alliances, which were crucial for its survival against more powerful adversaries. Over time, the pressures from rival kingdoms, particularly Silla and Goguryeo, intensified, contributing to Baekje's vulnerability.\n\nUltimately, Baekje was unable to withstand the combined military might of its rivals and was destroyed, marking the end of its influence in the region. The kingdom's legacy, however, remains significant in Korean history, as it contributed to the cultural and political development of the Korean peninsula during its time.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 209, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 396, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
