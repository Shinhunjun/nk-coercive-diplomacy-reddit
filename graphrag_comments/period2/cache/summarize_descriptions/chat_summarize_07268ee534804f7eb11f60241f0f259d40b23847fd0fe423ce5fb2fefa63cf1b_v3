These sanctions are part of a broader international effort to restrict North Korea's capabilities in developing nuclear weapons and missile technology. The sanctions aim to pressure the North Korean government to abandon its nuclear ambitions and engage in diplomatic negotiations regarding disarmament.\n\nThe sanctions encompass a range of actions, including trade restrictions, asset freezes, and limitations on financial transactions. They are designed to target key sectors of the North Korean economy, such as coal, textiles, and seafood, which are vital sources of revenue for the regime. By limiting these economic activities, the sanctions seek to diminish the resources available to North Korea for its military and nuclear programs.\n\nIn summary, North Korean sanctions are a coordinated international response aimed at curbing the country's nuclear and missile development activities, primarily through economic pressure and diplomatic efforts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 385, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
