He gained significant public attention for leading the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, which included examining potential collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. In this capacity, he was appointed as a special counsel, a position that allowed him to conduct an independent investigation into the various allegations surrounding the election.\n\nMueller's tenure as FBI director spanned from 2001 to 2013, during which he oversaw numerous high-profile cases and initiatives, including the Bureau's response to the September 11 attacks. His leadership was characterized by a focus on counterterrorism and cybersecurity, as well as efforts to modernize the FBI's operations.\n\nThe investigation he led into the 2016 election was marked by extensive scrutiny and political controversy.
