His leadership has been marked by significant controversy and international criticism, primarily due to his authoritarian governance style and the country's troubling descent into dictatorship. Under Maduro's rule, Venezuela has experienced severe economic decline, widespread poverty, and a humanitarian crisis, leading to mass emigration and social unrest. His administration has been accused of undermining democratic institutions, suppressing dissent, and violating human rights, further exacerbating the political and social turmoil within the nation. Despite these challenges, Maduro has maintained a firm grip on power, often employing repressive measures against opposition and dissenting voices.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 139, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 331, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
