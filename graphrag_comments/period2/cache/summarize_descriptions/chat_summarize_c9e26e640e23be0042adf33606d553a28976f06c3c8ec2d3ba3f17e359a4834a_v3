His rule was marked by a mix of authoritarian governance and significant social reforms, which included improvements in education and healthcare. Gaddafi's regime was often characterized as controversial due to its repressive nature and human rights violations.\n\nIn addition to his domestic policies, Gaddafi was known for his role in international affairs, particularly regarding nuclear weapons. He gained international attention for his compliance in dismantling Libya's nuclear weapons program, which was seen as a significant step towards reducing global nuclear proliferation. This move was part of a broader strategy to improve Libya's relations with Western nations, especially after years of isolation and sanctions.\n\nGaddafi's leadership style was often described as eccentric, and he was known for his flamboyant public appearances and speeches. His political ideology, outlined in his Green Book, combined elements of socialism, Arab nationalism, and direct democracy, which he referred to as \"Jamahiriya\" or \"state of the masses.\" Despite his initial popularity, his later years in power were marked by increasing dissent and unrest, culminating in the civil war that ultimately led to his downfall.\n\nIn summary, Muammar Gaddafi was a complex figure in Libyan history, whose long tenure was defined by both significant social advancements and a repressive regime, alongside notable international actions regarding nuclear disarmament. His legacy remains contentious, reflecting the duality of his contributions to Libya and the controversies surrounding his rule.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 311, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 513, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
