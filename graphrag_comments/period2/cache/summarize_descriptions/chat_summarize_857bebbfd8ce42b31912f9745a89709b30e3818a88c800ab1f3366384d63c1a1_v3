This approach was part of a broader economic strategy aimed at reshaping the United States' trade relationships and addressing perceived imbalances in international trade. The tariffs were designed to protect American industries and jobs by making imported goods more expensive, thereby encouraging consumers to buy domestically produced products.\n\nTrump's administration viewed these tariffs as a means to leverage negotiations with other countries, particularly in the context of trade agreements. The imposition of tariffs had significant implications not only for the U.S. economy but also for international relations, as it often led to retaliatory measures from affected countries. This strategy reflected Trump's broader economic policy goals, which emphasized an \"America First\" approach, prioritizing American interests in global trade discussions.\n\nOverall, Trump's use of tariffs was a central element of his administration's efforts to redefine the United States' role in the global economy, aiming to foster domestic growth while navigating complex international trade dynamics.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 376, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
