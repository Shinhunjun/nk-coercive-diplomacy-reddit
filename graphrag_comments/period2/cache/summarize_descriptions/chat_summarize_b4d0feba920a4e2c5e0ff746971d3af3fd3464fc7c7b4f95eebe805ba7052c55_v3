They are known for controlling substantial economic resources, which allows them to play a significant role in shaping political landscapes and decisions. In the context of Russia, oligarchs often have a direct impact on companies and political decisions, especially regarding lucrative contracts and government dealings.\n\nThe term \"oligarch\" is frequently associated with the rise of these individuals following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when many capitalized on the privatization of state assets. Their wealth and influence have enabled them to forge close ties with political leaders, thereby securing their interests and further entrenching their power within the political system. This relationship between wealth and political influence is particularly evident in the context of contracts awarded by political figures, including those associated with former President Donald Trump.\n\nOverall, oligarchs represent a unique intersection of wealth, power, and politics, particularly in Russia, where their influence extends beyond mere economic control to encompass significant political sway.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 207, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 410, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
