He is widely recognized for his controversial policies and statements, particularly in the realm of foreign relations. One of the most notable aspects of his presidency was his unconventional approach to diplomacy, especially regarding North Korea. Trump engaged directly with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, participating in historic summits aimed at addressing North Korea's nuclear program.\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump was involved in significant diplomatic discussions concerning North Korea's denuclearization. He called for North Korea to denuclearize and sought to negotiate a nuclear deal with Kim Jong-un. His administration's efforts included a high-profile summit in Singapore, where the two leaders discussed the future of North Korea's nuclear capabilities. Trump also proposed halting joint military exercises with South Korea as part of his strategy to foster dialogue with North Korea.\n\nDespite these diplomatic overtures, Trump's foreign policy was often characterized by controversy. He maintained a tough stance on sanctions against North Korea, indicating that he was in no rush to achieve denuclearization and aimed to use sanctions as leverage in negotiations. His administration's approach to foreign relations extended beyond North Korea, as he was known for his contentious dealings with various world leaders and his unorthodox political style.\n\nIn addition to his focus on North Korea, Trump made headlines for his foreign policy decisions regarding other nations, including Venezuela. His presidency was marked by a series of bold and often polarizing statements and actions that drew both support and criticism domestically and internationally.\n\nOverall, Donald Trump's presidency was defined by his significant role in international diplomacy, particularly with North Korea, where he sought to reshape longstanding U.S. foreign policy through direct engagement and negotiation. His legacy includes a mix of historic diplomatic efforts and contentious political positions that continue to influence discussions on U.S. foreign relations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 376, "prompt_tokens": 933, "total_tokens": 1309, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
