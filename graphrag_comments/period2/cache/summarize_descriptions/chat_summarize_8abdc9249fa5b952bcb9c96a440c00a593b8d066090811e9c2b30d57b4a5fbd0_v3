This relationship is characterized by North Korea's pursuit of support from Russia as a counterbalance to U.S. influence in the region, while simultaneously striving to uphold its own sovereignty. Historically, Russia has played a significant role in supporting North Korea through various means, including military and economic assistance. This support has been particularly relevant in the context of North Korea's ongoing tensions with the United States and its allies.\n\nThe partnership between Russia and North Korea is rooted in a shared interest in opposing U.S. dominance in global affairs. North Korea often looks to Russia for diplomatic backing and resources, especially during times of heightened international scrutiny or sanctions. In return, Russia benefits from its relationship with North Korea by maintaining a foothold in East Asia and countering Western influence.\n\nOverall, the relationship between Russia and the DPRK is complex, marked by historical ties and mutual interests, particularly in the face of external pressures from the United States.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 208, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 399, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
