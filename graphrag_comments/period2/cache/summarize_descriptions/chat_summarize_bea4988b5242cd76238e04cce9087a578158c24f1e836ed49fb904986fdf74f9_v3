It began when North Korea invaded South Korea, marking the start of hostilities that would involve international forces, including military support from the United States and China. The war resulted in a military stalemate and the establishment of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which effectively divided the Korean Peninsula into two separate entities: North Korea and South Korea.\n\nAlthough the Korean War officially ended with an armistice agreement in 1953, it did not conclude with a formal peace treaty, leaving the two Koreas technically still at war. This unresolved status has led to ongoing tensions and conflicts in the region, significantly impacting the geopolitical landscape of East Asia. The implications of the Korean War continue to resonate today, influencing North Korea's relations with its neighbors and the United States, as well as shaping the current geopolitical situation in Korea.\n\nThe war's legacy includes North Korea's isolation from the outside world and the enduring hostilities between North and South Korea. The conflict has had lasting effects on regional stability and has been a focal point of international relations, particularly in the context of U.S.-North Korea relations. The Korean War remains a critical event in understanding the historical and contemporary dynamics of the Korean Peninsula, as well as the broader implications for global security.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 278, "prompt_tokens": 964, "total_tokens": 1242, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
