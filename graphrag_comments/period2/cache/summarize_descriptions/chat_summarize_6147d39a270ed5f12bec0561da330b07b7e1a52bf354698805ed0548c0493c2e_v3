Security Council has imposed a series of sanctions on North Korea in response to its ongoing nuclear weapons program and significant human rights violations. These sanctions are aimed at curbing North Korea's ability to develop and enhance its nuclear capabilities, which pose a threat to international peace and security. Additionally, the sanctions specifically target the country's oil imports, seeking to limit its access to essential resources that could support its military ambitions. Through these measures, the U.N. Security Council aims to pressure North Korea into compliance with international norms and to encourage a shift towards denuclearization and improved human rights practices.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 313, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
