He served as the leader from 1994 until his death in 2011, during which he continued to advance North Korea's nuclear weapons program, a key aspect of his regime's military strategy. Kim Jong Il was also the father of Kim Jong Un, who succeeded him as the leader of North Korea.\n\nThroughout his rule, Kim Jong Il cultivated a strong cult of personality, which was characterized by extensive propaganda that portrayed him as a near-divine figure. This cult of personality was instrumental in maintaining his grip on power and fostering loyalty among the North Korean populace. His leadership was marked by a combination of authoritarian governance, economic challenges, and a focus on military strength, particularly through the development of nuclear capabilities.\n\nUnder Kim Jong Il's regime, North Korea faced significant international scrutiny and sanctions due to its nuclear ambitions, which were seen as a threat to regional and global security. His tenure was marked by a series of nuclear tests and the pursuit of missile technology, which further isolated the country from the international community.\n\nIn summary, Kim Jong Il was a pivotal figure in North Korean history, known for his controversial leadership, the establishment of a cult of personality, and the aggressive pursuit of nuclear weapons, all of which laid the groundwork for the subsequent leadership of his son, Kim Jong Un.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 279, "prompt_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 495, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
