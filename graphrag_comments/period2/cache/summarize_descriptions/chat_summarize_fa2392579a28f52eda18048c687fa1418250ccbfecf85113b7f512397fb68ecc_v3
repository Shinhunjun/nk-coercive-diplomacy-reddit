These missile tests have become a significant source of tension, complicating diplomatic efforts and military relations between the two nations. The US views North Korea's missile program as a direct threat to regional and global security, leading to a series of military responses and sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's capabilities. Conversely, North Korea perceives these actions as aggressive and provocative, further entrenching the adversarial nature of their relationship. Overall, the dynamics between the US and North Korea are marked by a cycle of provocation and response, with ongoing military and diplomatic tensions shaping their interactions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 329, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
