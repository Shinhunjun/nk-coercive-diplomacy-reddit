These sanctions are designed to limit North Korea's access to resources, which has contributed to significant food shortages within the country. The sanctions specifically target trade and economic activities, effectively curtailing North Korea's ability to engage in international commerce and obtain necessary goods and services. \n\nThe overarching goal of these sanctions is to pressure North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program, which has raised concerns among the international community regarding regional and global security. By restricting trade, the UN sanctions seek to diminish North Korea's economic capabilities, thereby limiting its capacity to develop and maintain its nuclear arsenal. \n\nIn summary, UN Sanctions serve as a critical tool for the international community to address the challenges posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions, while also impacting inter-Korean projects and contributing to humanitarian issues within North Korea itself.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 182, "prompt_tokens": 269, "total_tokens": 451, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
