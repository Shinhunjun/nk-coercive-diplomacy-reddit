South Korea perceives China as an existential threat, primarily due to China's significant military capabilities and its ambitions within the region. This perception is rooted in a history of conflict and competition, which has fostered a sense of wariness in South Korea regarding China's intentions and actions. The dynamics of this relationship are influenced by various factors, including regional security concerns, economic interdependence, and differing political ideologies.
