The country's nuclear program has been a focal point in diplomatic negotiations, drawing significant attention from global powers and international organizations. North Korea views its nuclear arsenal as essential for its national defense and a means to assert its sovereignty on the world stage.\n\nThe international community regards North Korea's nuclear capabilities as a major concern, given the potential threat they pose to regional stability and global security.
