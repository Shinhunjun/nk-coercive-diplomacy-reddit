As a leader of a coalition, the U.S. actively works to disrupt North Korea's illicit oil transfers, which are critical to the regime's ability to sustain its military and nuclear ambitions. This effort is part of a broader strategy to maintain economic pressure on North Korea, aimed at curbing its nuclear development and promoting regional stability.\n\nIn addition to its coalition efforts, the United States has been deeply involved in diplomatic initiatives and has imposed a series of sanctions in response to North Korea's ongoing nuclear weapons program. These sanctions are designed to limit North Korea's access to resources necessary for its nuclear and missile development, thereby seeking to deter further advancements in its military capabilities.\n\nThe U.S. maintains a significant military presence in South Korea, which serves as a deterrent against potential aggression from the North. This military presence is complemented by ongoing diplomatic talks with North Korea, focusing on military and nuclear issues. The United States engages in these discussions with the hope of achieving denuclearization and ensuring peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nFurthermore, the United States closely monitors North Korea's missile development activities, which remain a critical concern for national and regional security. Through a combination of military readiness, sanctions, and diplomatic engagement, the U.S. aims to address the complexities of North Korea's actions and work towards a peaceful resolution to the ongoing tensions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 295, "prompt_tokens": 267, "total_tokens": 562, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
