The conflict began in 1950 and lasted until 1953, resulting in a devastating war that caused substantial loss of life and destruction. Despite the armistice signed in 1953, which effectively ended active combat, the conflict did not conclude with a formal peace treaty, leading to a state of ongoing hostilities and military standoffs between the two Koreas.\n\nThe Korean Conflict is characterized by its complex interplay of international relations, involving key global stakeholders such as the United States and China. The U.S. has historically supported South Korea, while China has been an ally of North Korea, further complicating the dynamics of the conflict. This international involvement has contributed to the persistent tensions in the region, as both Koreas maintain a heavily militarized border and engage in periodic confrontations.\n\nOverall, the Korean Conflict remains a critical issue in East Asian politics, with its roots deeply embedded in the historical, ideological, and military divisions that emerged in the aftermath of World War II. The legacy of the conflict continues to influence diplomatic relations and security strategies in the region today.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 242, "prompt_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 473, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
