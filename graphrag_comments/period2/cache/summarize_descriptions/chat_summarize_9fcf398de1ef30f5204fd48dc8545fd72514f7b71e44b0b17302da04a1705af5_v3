The TPP aimed to enhance economic ties, promote trade liberalization, and establish a framework for addressing various trade-related issues among its member nations. However, the United States withdrew from the TPP, which had a considerable impact on its economic relationships with countries in the region, including major economies like China and North Korea.\n\nDespite the negotiations surrounding the TPP, the agreement was never ratified by the United States. During the Trump administration, some chapters of the TPP were incorporated into the new North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which indicates a shift in trade policy and priorities. The withdrawal and subsequent changes reflect the complexities and challenges of international trade agreements, particularly in the context of U.S. foreign policy and economic strategy.\n\nOverall, the TPP represents a pivotal moment in trade relations within the Asia-Pacific region, highlighting the interplay between national interests and multilateral agreements.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 202, "prompt_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 417, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
