These explosive devices derive their destructive force from nuclear reactions and have become a significant aspect of North Korea's defense strategy and international relations, contributing to global security concerns. The development and possession of nuclear weapons by North Korea pose a substantial threat to both regional and global security, making them a central issue in discussions about international security and military strategy.\n\nSince the 1950s, North Korea has been actively developing and testing its nuclear arsenal, which has led to international sanctions aimed at compelling the country to abandon its nuclear ambitions. The existence of these weapons is a major concern for global powers, particularly in the context of negotiations between North Korea and the United States, where denuclearization remains a primary focus. North Korea's nuclear capabilities are not only a point of contention in its relations with the U.S. but also a source of anxiety for neighboring countries, such as Japan, which are concerned about their own defense in light of North Korea's military advancements.\n\nThe international community views North Korea's nuclear weapons program as a significant global concern, with discussions surrounding non-proliferation and disarmament frequently highlighting the need to address this issue. North Korea's continued development and potential mass production of nuclear weapons have raised alarms, as these capabilities are seen as a means for the regime to exert military and political leverage on the global stage.\n\nIn summary, nuclear weapons are a central element of North Korea's military capabilities and strategy, significantly impacting international relations and security dynamics. The ongoing development and possession of these weapons by North Korea remain a focal point in global discussions about security, non-proliferation, and the future of peace negotiations involving the country.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 353, "prompt_tokens": 816, "total_tokens": 1169, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
