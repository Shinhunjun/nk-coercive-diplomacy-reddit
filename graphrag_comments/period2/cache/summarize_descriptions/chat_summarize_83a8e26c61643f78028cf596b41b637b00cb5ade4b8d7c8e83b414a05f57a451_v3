Since its inception, the U.N. has played a crucial role in addressing global challenges and fostering diplomatic relations between countries. One of its significant functions includes the imposition of sanctions on nations that pose threats to international peace and security. A notable example of this is the U.N.'s sanctions against North Korea, aimed at curbing the country's oil imports and limiting its nuclear capabilities. These measures reflect the U.N.'s commitment to maintaining global stability and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Through its various initiatives and actions, the U.N. continues to strive for a more peaceful and cooperative world.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 152, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 339, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
