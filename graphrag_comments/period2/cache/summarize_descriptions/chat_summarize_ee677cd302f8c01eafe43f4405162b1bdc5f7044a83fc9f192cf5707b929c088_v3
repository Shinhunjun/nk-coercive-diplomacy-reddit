These missiles are a critical component of North Korea's military strategy and development efforts. North Korea has been actively developing and testing ICBMs, which are capable of reaching targets over 5,500 kilometers away. \n\nThe significance of ICBMs in North Korea's military framework cannot be overstated, as they represent a key focus of the country's military advancements. The development of these missiles is seen as a means for North Korea to enhance its deterrent capabilities and assert its military power on the global stage. The possession and potential deployment of ICBMs by North Korea have raised concerns internationally, particularly regarding regional security and the implications for global nuclear non-proliferation efforts.\n\nIn summary, ICBMs are long-range missiles that North Korea is believed to possess and is actively working to develop, with the capability to carry nuclear warheads and strike targets across continents. This development is central to North Korea's military strategy and poses significant challenges to international security.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 224, "prompt_tokens": 456, "total_tokens": 680, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
