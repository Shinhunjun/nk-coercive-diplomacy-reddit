His administration sought to address various concerns regarding the original agreement, which had been in effect since 1994. As a result of these efforts, Trump replaced NAFTA with a new trade agreement, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This new agreement aimed to modernize trade relations with Canada and Mexico, reflecting changes in the economy and addressing issues such as labor rights, environmental standards, and digital trade. The renegotiation and subsequent replacement of NAFTA marked a pivotal shift in U.S. trade policy, significantly impacting economic interactions within North America.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 148, "prompt_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 326, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
