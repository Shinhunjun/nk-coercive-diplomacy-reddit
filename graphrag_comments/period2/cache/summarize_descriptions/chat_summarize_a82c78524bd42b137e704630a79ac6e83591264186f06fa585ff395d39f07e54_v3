Recently, former President Donald Trump has been associated with the Nobel Prize due to his diplomatic efforts aimed at fostering peace with North Korea. His administration's negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un were significant enough that Trump was suggested as a potential candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. This suggestion stemmed from the belief that his initiatives could lead to a reduction in tensions on the Korean Peninsula and a move towards denuclearization. Trump's pursuit of the Nobel Prize was thus closely linked to his diplomatic strategies and the outcomes of his engagements with North Korea.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 334, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
