Its primary objective is to reduce trade barriers among the three nations, facilitating smoother and more efficient trade relations. Originally implemented to promote economic cooperation and increase trade volume, NAFTA has played a crucial role in shaping the economic landscape of North America.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, NAFTA underwent a renegotiation process, which aimed to address various concerns and modernize the agreement to better reflect the current economic environment.
