This relationship is primarily characterized by significant tensions arising from North Korea's nuclear weapons program. The US has expressed deep concerns regarding DPRK's nuclear ambitions, which it views as a direct threat to regional and global security.\n\nThe conflict between the US and DPRK is not limited to nuclear issues; it also encompasses a range of military actions and provocations that have escalated tensions over the years. The US has implemented various sanctions and diplomatic measures aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear development and ensuring compliance with international norms. In response, DPRK has often engaged in military demonstrations, including missile tests, which further exacerbate the already strained relations.\n\nOverall, the relationship between the US and DPRK remains fraught with challenges, driven by mutual distrust and differing national interests, particularly concerning security and military capabilities.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 190, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 376, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
