This policy is a key goal in discussions involving North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile programs, with a particular emphasis on reducing its nuclear capabilities. The United States has made denuclearization a central demand in its negotiations with North Korea, highlighting the importance of this issue in the context of international relations.\n\nNorth Korea's commitment to denuclearization is a pivotal aspect of its diplomatic relations, especially with the United States. The discussions surrounding denuclearization often focus on North Korea's nuclear arsenal and the potential for disarmament. As such, denuclearization is not only a policy aimed at eliminating North Korea's nuclear weapons but also a critical topic in the broader context of military capabilities and international security.\n\nThe negotiations regarding denuclearization are primarily centered on North Korea's nuclear ambitions, which have raised significant concerns among the international community. North Korea's nuclear program is the main focus of denuclearization efforts by the U.S. and its allies, and the country's military parades and missile tests often prompt questions about its genuine commitment to these denuclearization discussions.\n\nOverall, denuclearization remains a key policy issue in negotiations involving North Korea, with the aim of addressing the nuclear threat posed by its weapons program. The ongoing dialogue reflects the complexities of North Korea's nuclear capabilities and the international community's efforts to curb its nuclear ambitions through diplomatic means.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 289, "prompt_tokens": 908, "total_tokens": 1197, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
