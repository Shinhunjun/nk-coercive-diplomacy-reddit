He has been a central figure in international discussions regarding North Korea's nuclear weapons program and has participated in negotiations with the United States aimed at denuclearization. Throughout his leadership, Kim has emphasized military strength and has been involved in strategic discussions concerning the U.S. military presence on the Korean peninsula.\n\nUnder Kim's leadership, North Korea has pursued a robust nuclear missile program, which has drawn considerable global attention and concern. Despite this, he has made public assurances regarding the safety of the nation, claiming that there are no more nuclear threats. His regime is characterized by strict control over information and the populace, reflecting his authoritarian governance style.\n\nKim Jong-un has engaged in high-profile negotiations with various U.S. administrations, including discussions with former President Donald Trump, focusing on denuclearization and military exercises. These negotiations have been pivotal in shaping North Korea's foreign relations, particularly with the United States and China. Kim's leadership has been marked by a dual approach: while he seeks to project strength through military capabilities, he also engages in diplomatic efforts to alleviate international tensions and secure concessions.\n\nOverall, Kim Jong-un's tenure as the leader of North Korea is defined by his controversial leadership style, his regime's nuclear ambitions, and his involvement in complex international negotiations that aim to reshape North Korea's standing on the global stage.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 292, "prompt_tokens": 664, "total_tokens": 956, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
