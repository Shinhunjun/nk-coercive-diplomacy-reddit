This area is characterized by its role as a neutral space, where military forces from both sides are prohibited, thereby reducing the potential for conflict. The DMZ stretches approximately 250 kilometers (160 miles) across the Korean Peninsula and is about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) wide.\n\nIn addition to its function as a military buffer, the DMZ has also become a significant venue for diplomatic engagements. It is a location where U.S. envoy meetings with North Korean officials occur, highlighting its importance in international relations and peace negotiations on the Korean Peninsula. The DMZ is not only a physical barrier but also a focal point for discussions aimed at reducing tensions and fostering dialogue between the two Koreas and their allies.\n\nOverall, the Demilitarized Zone stands as a critical element in the ongoing efforts to maintain peace and stability in a region marked by historical conflict and ongoing geopolitical challenges.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 214, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 416, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
