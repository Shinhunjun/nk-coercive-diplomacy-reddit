This approach is designed to control the narrative surrounding the government, shaping how the populace views both domestic and international issues. Through various means, North Korea seeks to maintain strict control over its population, using propaganda to justify its military actions and policies.\n\nThe regime's propaganda efforts are aimed at reinforcing a positive image of the government while simultaneously portraying external entities, particularly the United States, in a negative light. This narrative is crucial for justifying the government's stance on various issues, including its military posture and the conditions within its prisons. By shaping perceptions of its regime, North Korea attempts to foster loyalty among its citizens and mitigate dissent.\n\nIn summary, North Korea's use of propaganda serves multiple purposes: it influences citizens' views, controls the narrative about the government, justifies military actions, and shapes both domestic and international perceptions of the regime. This multifaceted approach is essential for maintaining the government's authority and ensuring the loyalty of its population.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 211, "prompt_tokens": 266, "total_tokens": 477, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
