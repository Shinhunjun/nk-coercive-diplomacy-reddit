This military presence is a key factor in the ongoing negotiations with North Korea, as it is often viewed as a point of contention by the North Korean regime. The USA's commitment to South Korea is primarily aimed at counterbalancing North Korean aggression, ensuring the security and stability of the region.\n\nThrough this military support, the USA not only reinforces its alliance with South Korea but also deters potential threats from North Korea.
