This relationship has evolved over the years, with Beijing continuing to play a crucial role in diplomatic discussions concerning peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. As North Korea engages in military actions that often raise tensions in the region, Beijing remains a central figure in the diplomatic landscape, facilitating dialogue and negotiations aimed at mitigating conflict.\n\nNorth Korea's reliance on China extends beyond historical ties; it is fundamentally rooted in economic and diplomatic dependencies. Beijing serves as a vital source of economic support for North Korea, providing essential trade and resources that are critical for the North Korean economy. This economic relationship reinforces China's influence over North Korea's strategic decisions and actions.\n\nIn summary, Beijing's involvement with North Korea is characterized by a complex interplay of historical support, ongoing diplomatic engagement, and economic reliance, making it a key player in the dynamics of the Korean Peninsula.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 199, "prompt_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 415, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
