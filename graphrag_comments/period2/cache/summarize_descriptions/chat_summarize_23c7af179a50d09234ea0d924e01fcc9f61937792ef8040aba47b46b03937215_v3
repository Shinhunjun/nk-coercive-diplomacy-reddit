Since the end of World War II, the peninsula has been divided, leading to a complex and often tense relationship between the two Koreas. This division has made the Korean Peninsula a focal point for geopolitical tensions, particularly regarding military developments and diplomatic relations.\n\nThe region has been the center of ongoing military tensions, with North Korea's nuclear program being a significant concern for both South Korea and the international community, especially the United States.
