They can influence international relationships and are often discussed in the context of trade wars. In recent years, tariffs have been notably proposed by former President Trump as a strategy to address trade imbalances, particularly with China. This approach has had broader implications, affecting not only the U.S.-China relationship but also indirectly impacting North Korea.\n\nIn the context of U.S. foreign policy, tariffs can also be utilized as a form of economic pressure in negotiations, particularly regarding sensitive issues such as denuclearization. The United States has considered imposing tariffs on North Korea as a means to exert influence and encourage compliance with international demands related to its nuclear program. Thus, tariffs serve a dual purpose: they are a mechanism for protecting domestic industries and a strategic tool in international diplomacy, particularly in negotiations involving countries like China and North Korea.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 190, "prompt_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 428, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
