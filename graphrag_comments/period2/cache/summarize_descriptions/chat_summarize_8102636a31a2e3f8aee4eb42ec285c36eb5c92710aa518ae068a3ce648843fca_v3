This extensive arsenal serves not only as a deterrent against potential adversaries but also as a key component in the USA's approach to global security dynamics. The presence of these nuclear weapons underscores the USA's commitment to maintaining military superiority and its role as a leading power on the world stage.\n\nIn addition to its own nuclear capabilities, the USA closely monitors the nuclear weapons developments of other nations, particularly North Korea. The USA's vested interest in North Korea's nuclear weapons program has a profound impact on its foreign policy decisions. This concern stems from the potential threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions, which could destabilize regional security in East Asia and challenge the USA's strategic interests.\n\nOverall, the USA's nuclear weapons stockpile and its engagement with the nuclear capabilities of other countries, such as North Korea, are pivotal elements of its national security strategy and international diplomatic efforts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 198, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 389, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
