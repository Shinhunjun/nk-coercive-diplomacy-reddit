His leadership marked the inception of the regime, which has been characterized by a strong emphasis on Juche, or self-reliance, as a guiding principle. Under Kim Il Sung's rule, North Korea developed a centralized government and a command economy, which were instrumental in shaping the country's political landscape.\n\nOne of the notable aspects of Kim Il Sung's legacy is the initiation of North Korea's nuclear weapons program. His regime laid the groundwork for the development of this program, which has since become a central element of North Korea's national security strategy and international relations. The focus on military strength and nuclear capability has been a defining feature of North Korea's policies, reflecting Kim Il Sung's commitment to maintaining the regime's power and sovereignty.\n\nOverall, Kim Il Sung's influence on North Korea is profound, as he not only founded the state but also established the ideological and military foundations that continue to shape the country's identity and its interactions on the global stage.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 216, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 409, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
