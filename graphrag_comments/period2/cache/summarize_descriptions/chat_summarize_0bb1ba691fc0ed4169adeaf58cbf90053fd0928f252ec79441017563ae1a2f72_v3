He is recognized for his controversial leadership style, characterized by authoritarian rule and a focus on consolidating power within the country. Under his leadership, North Korea has pursued an aggressive nuclear weapons program, which has led to heightened tensions with both South Korea and the United States.\n\nKim Jong-un's regime is marked by its nuclear ambitions, and he has been involved in various negotiations aimed at denuclearization, particularly with the United States. Notably, he participated in a historic summit with then-President Donald Trump in Singapore, which was a significant moment in U.S.-North Korea relations. Despite these diplomatic efforts, Kim has continued to maintain and develop North Korea's nuclear capabilities, often engaging in military activities that contradict his pledges for denuclearization.\n\nHis leadership has also been associated with controversial actions, including the assassination of his half-brother, which has drawn international condemnation. Kim Jong-un seeks legitimacy on the global stage through high-profile meetings with world leaders, particularly U.S. presidents, while simultaneously reinforcing his regime's military posture.\n\nOverall, Kim Jong-un's tenure as the leader of North Korea is defined by a dual approach: pursuing international diplomacy and negotiations regarding nuclear disarmament, while simultaneously upholding a strong commitment to the country's nuclear weapons program and maintaining an authoritarian grip on power.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 279, "prompt_tokens": 864, "total_tokens": 1143, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
