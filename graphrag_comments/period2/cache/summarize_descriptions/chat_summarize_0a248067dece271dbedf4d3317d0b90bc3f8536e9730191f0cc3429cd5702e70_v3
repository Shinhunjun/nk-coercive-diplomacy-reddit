This agreement effectively established a ceasefire, halting active combat between North Korea and South Korea. However, it is crucial to note that the Armistice Agreement did not culminate in a formal peace treaty, which means that the two Koreas remain technically in a state of war. \n\nSince its inception, the Armistice Agreement has been in effect for nearly 65 years, serving as a critical framework for maintaining a fragile peace on the Korean Peninsula. Despite the cessation of active military engagements, the absence of a peace treaty has perpetuated tensions and unresolved issues between the North and South. The agreement has thus played a pivotal role in shaping the geopolitical landscape of the region, influencing diplomatic relations and military strategies.\n\nIn summary, the Armistice Agreement is a ceasefire that marked the end of active combat in the Korean War, yet it has not been succeeded by a peace treaty, leaving North Korea and South Korea in a technically ongoing state of war.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 215, "prompt_tokens": 277, "total_tokens": 492, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
