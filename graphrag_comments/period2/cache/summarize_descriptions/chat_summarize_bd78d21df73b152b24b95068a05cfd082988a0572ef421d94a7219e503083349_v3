During his presidency, he significantly influenced both domestic and foreign policies of the USA. One of the notable aspects of his foreign policy was his approach towards North Korea, where he sought to engage with its leader, Kim Jong-un, in an effort to address nuclear proliferation and improve diplomatic relations. Trump's administration was characterized by a unique blend of assertive rhetoric and unprecedented summits, which aimed to reshape the long-standing tensions between the two nations.\n\nDomestically, Trump's policies were marked by a focus on economic growth, tax reform, and immigration control.
