These inspections are essential measures aimed at ensuring that North Korea adheres to international sanctions imposed due to its nuclear weapons program and other illicit activities. The policies surrounding cargo inspection are directly linked to the oversight of North Korea's compliance with these sanctions, making them a crucial component of international efforts to curb the country's potential threats to global security.
