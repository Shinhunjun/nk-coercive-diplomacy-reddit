This famine is often attributed to a combination of the country's internal policies and the impact of international economic sanctions. These factors have severely affected the well-being of the North Korean population, leading to widespread food shortages and malnutrition.\n\nThe famine of the 1990s was a pivotal event in North Korea's history, shaping its current political and economic landscape. The government's agricultural policies, which were often inefficient and poorly managed, contributed to the crisis. Additionally, the isolationist stance of North Korea, compounded by sanctions imposed by the international community, further exacerbated the situation, limiting access to essential resources and aid.\n\nAs a result, the famine not only had immediate devastating effects on the population but also influenced the country's governance and economic strategies in the years that followed. The legacy of this famine continues to impact North Korea's policies and its relationship with the outside world, as the nation grapples with the consequences of its past decisions and the ongoing challenges of food security.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 216, "prompt_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 410, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
