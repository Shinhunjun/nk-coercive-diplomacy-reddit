This conflict, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, not only shaped the political landscape of the Korean Peninsula but also solidified the division between the two nations. The war arose from the tensions following the end of World War II, when Korea was divided along the 38th parallel into two separate zones of occupation: the Soviet-backed North and the American-backed South.\n\nThe Korean War began when North Korea, seeking to reunify the country under its communist regime, invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950. This aggressive action prompted a swift response from the United Nations, led by the United States, which intervened on behalf of South Korea. The conflict saw intense fighting, with significant casualties on both sides, and it drew in various international forces, further complicating the situation.\n\nThe war concluded with an armistice agreement on July 27, 1953, but no formal peace treaty was ever signed, leaving the two Koreas technically still at war. The armistice established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), a heavily fortified border that continues to separate North and South Korea to this day. The legacy of the Korean War is evident in the ongoing tensions and the stark differences between the two nations, which have developed distinct political systems, economies, and cultures since the war.\n\nIn summary, the Korean War was a significant event that not only influenced the immediate post-war period but also laid the groundwork for the enduring division between North and South Korea, shaping the geopolitical dynamics of the region for decades to come.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 333, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 524, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
