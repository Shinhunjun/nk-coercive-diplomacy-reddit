The organization has been involved in numerous acts of terrorism and has garnered international attention for its brutal tactics and radical beliefs. Various nations, including the United States, have opposed ISIS, leading to targeted military actions aimed at dismantling its operations and influence in the region.\n\nDuring his presidency, Donald Trump claimed that he would defeat ISIS within 30 days, asserting that the group had been effectively eliminated. However, despite these claims, ISIS has continued to be perceived as a significant threat, with some Americans considering it a more pressing danger than North Korea's nuclear capabilities. This perception underscores the ongoing concerns regarding ISIS's ability to regroup and carry out violent acts, even as military efforts have sought to weaken its presence.\n\nOverall, ISIS remains a prominent and contentious entity in discussions about global terrorism and security, reflecting the complexities of combating extremist ideologies and the challenges faced by nations in addressing such threats.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 206, "prompt_tokens": 264, "total_tokens": 470, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
