In June 2018, Singapore hosted a historic summit between United States President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, marking a significant moment in diplomatic discussions aimed at addressing denuclearization. The summit, which was a pivotal event in international relations, was facilitated by Singapore's neutral stance and its reputation for hosting high-profile diplomatic talks.\n\nThe event was a considerable investment for Singapore, with costs reported to be around $12 million to $15 million, reflecting the city-state's commitment to enhancing its global reputation as a diplomatic host. Despite the substantial financial outlay, the summit positioned Singapore prominently on the world stage, showcasing its capabilities in managing complex international negotiations.\n\nHowever, the summit also brought challenges, as Singapore became the top target of cyber-attacks during this period, highlighting the vulnerabilities that can accompany hosting such significant events. Despite these challenges, Singapore's successful hosting of the Trump-Kim summit underscored its strategic importance in global diplomacy and its ability to navigate complex geopolitical landscapes.\n\nOverall, Singapore's role in the summit between the United States and North Korea exemplifies its status as a key player in international relations, characterized by its highly developed economy and strategic diplomatic initiatives, even as it operates under a non-democratic governance structure.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 272, "prompt_tokens": 397, "total_tokens": 669, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
