The GOP has consistently labeled the deal as a poor agreement, arguing that it undermines U.S. interests and security. Republican leaders contend that the terms of the deal are flawed and do not adequately prevent Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities. This critical stance reflects a broader concern within the party regarding the implications of the deal for both national and international security. The GOP's opposition is rooted in the belief that the agreement fails to hold Iran accountable and could potentially lead to increased instability in the region. Overall, the Republican Party's perspective on the Iran Nuclear Deal emphasizes a commitment to safeguarding U.S. interests and ensuring robust measures against nuclear proliferation.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 357, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
