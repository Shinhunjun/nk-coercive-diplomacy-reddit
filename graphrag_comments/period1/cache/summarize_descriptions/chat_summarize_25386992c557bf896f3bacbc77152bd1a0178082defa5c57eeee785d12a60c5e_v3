He has publicly emphasized the importance of diplomacy, often prioritizing it over military action, despite facing significant criticism regarding his methods. This approach has been particularly evident in his administration's efforts to address issues with North Korea.\n\nTrump's diplomatic strategy has been characterized by a duality: on one hand, he has employed a confrontational style, utilizing threats as a means to exert pressure; on the other hand, he has engaged in negotiations aimed at resolving tensions. This mix of aggression and diplomacy has led to a controversial legacy, drawing scrutiny from various political figures and analysts who question the effectiveness and consistency of his methods.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Trump has exhibited skepticism towards traditional diplomatic agreements, which has influenced his negotiations with North Korea. His tendency to withdraw from established agreements has raised concerns about the stability and reliability of U.S. diplomatic commitments. This skepticism has not only affected relations with North Korea but has also reverberated through other international engagements, leading to a reevaluation of the United States' role in global diplomacy.\n\nIn summary, Trump's approach to diplomacy is characterized by a blend of aggressive posturing and attempts at negotiation, particularly in the context of North Korea. His administration's strategies have sparked debate and controversy, reflecting a broader skepticism towards conventional diplomatic practices and agreements.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 279, "prompt_tokens": 269, "total_tokens": 548, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
