The recovery efforts in Puerto Rico were widely regarded as inadequate, with many observers highlighting a lack of urgency and support from the federal government. Critics argued that Trump's focus on foreign policy issues, such as tensions with North Korea, served as a distraction from pressing domestic concerns, including the dire situation in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe handling of recovery efforts in Puerto Rico became a focal point of discontent, as many residents and officials felt that the federal response was slow and insufficient. Trump's policies and decisions during this period had profound implications for the island, exacerbating the challenges faced by its residents in the aftermath of the hurricane. The criticism of his administration's approach underscored the broader issues of disaster response and recovery, revealing a disconnect between the federal government's actions and the urgent needs of the Puerto Rican population. Overall, Trump's tenure was marked by a contentious relationship with Puerto Rico, characterized by a perceived neglect of the island's humanitarian needs.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 214, "prompt_tokens": 233, "total_tokens": 447, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
