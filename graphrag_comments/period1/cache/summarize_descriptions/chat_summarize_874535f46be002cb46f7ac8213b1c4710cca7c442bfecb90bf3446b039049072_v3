This strategic doctrine posits that the use of nuclear weapons by one state would result in the total annihilation of both the attacker and the defender, thereby deterring both sides from initiating a nuclear conflict. North Korea's interpretation and application of MAD are critical to its overall nuclear strategy and its diplomatic relations, particularly with the United States.\n\nThe regime in North Korea views its nuclear arsenal as a vital deterrent against perceived threats, especially from the US and its allies. By embracing the principles of MAD, North Korea aims to ensure its survival in a hostile international environment. This understanding shapes its military posture and influences its interactions on the global stage, as the country seeks to project strength and deter aggression through the threat of devastating retaliation.\n\nIn summary, North Korea's nuclear strategy is intricately linked to the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction, which plays a pivotal role in its defense policy and its approach to international relations, particularly with the United States.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 210, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 403, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
