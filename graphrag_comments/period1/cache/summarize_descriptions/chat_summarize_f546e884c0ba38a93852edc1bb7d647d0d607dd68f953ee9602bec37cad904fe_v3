This strategic doctrine serves as a deterrent against potential adversaries, particularly in the context of nuclear threats from nations such as North Korea. By maintaining a credible nuclear arsenal, the United States aims to ensure that any nuclear aggression would result in devastating retaliation, thereby discouraging adversaries from initiating conflict. The principle of MAD underscores the belief that the threat of total annihilation serves as a powerful incentive for nations to avoid engaging in nuclear warfare. Through this strategy, the United States seeks to uphold national security and stability in an increasingly complex global landscape.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 326, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
