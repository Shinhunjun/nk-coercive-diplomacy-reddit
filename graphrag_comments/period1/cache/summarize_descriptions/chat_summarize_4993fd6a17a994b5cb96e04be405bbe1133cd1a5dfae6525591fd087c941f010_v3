This relationship began in earnest during the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, following the September 11 attacks, with the primary objective of dismantling the Taliban regime that had provided sanctuary to al-Qaeda. Over the years, the US has maintained a military presence in Afghanistan, stationing troops to support various operations aimed at stabilizing the country and combating insurgent groups.\n\nThroughout its involvement, the US has supported different factions within Afghanistan, reflecting its strategic interests in countering terrorism and promoting a stable government. This support has included military aid, training, and resources to Afghan forces, as well as diplomatic efforts to foster political solutions to the ongoing conflict. The US's military presence has not only been a tool for direct engagement in combat but also a means to influence the political landscape of Afghanistan and the broader region.\n\nThe US's military strategy in Afghanistan has evolved over time, responding to changing dynamics on the ground and the shifting nature of threats posed by the Taliban and other militant groups. Despite the challenges faced, including high casualties and complex local politics, the US has remained committed to its objectives in Afghanistan, viewing its involvement as crucial to national and international security.\n\nIn summary, the US's relationship with Afghanistan is characterized by a long-standing military presence and active engagement in the region, aimed at combating terrorism and supporting the establishment of a stable Afghan government. This involvement has had significant implications for both US foreign policy and the geopolitical landscape of South Asia.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 317, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 519, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
