It plays a significant role in international diplomacy and conflict resolution, striving to promote peace, stability, and prosperity among its members and in the wider world. The EU is characterized by its efforts to foster cooperation among its member states, facilitating a single market that allows for the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people.\n\nIn recent years, the EU has been recognized as a potential dominant power bloc, particularly in relation to the United States.
