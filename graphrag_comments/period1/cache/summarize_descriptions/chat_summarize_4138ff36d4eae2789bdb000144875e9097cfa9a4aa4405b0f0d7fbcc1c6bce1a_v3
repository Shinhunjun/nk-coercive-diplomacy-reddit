Over the years, Hezbollah has evolved from a local militia into a formidable fighting force, bolstered by substantial support from Iran. This backing has not only enhanced its military capabilities but has also solidified its position as a pro-Iran element within the Middle East, influencing various geopolitical dynamics, including American foreign policy in the region.
