This tactic is often employed as a measure to exert pressure on a nation, and in this context, it has been proposed as a potential response to North Korea. The implementation of a blockade involves restricting maritime travel to and from the targeted country, effectively isolating it from international trade and support. Such a policy aims to limit the resources available to the nation, thereby influencing its actions and decisions on the global stage. In summary, a blockade serves as a strategic tool to control and restrict a country's access to essential goods and services, with North Korea being a specific focus of this military and diplomatic approach.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 141, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 332, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
