One of the most notable actions was the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, which marked a departure from previous U.S. policy and was met with both support and criticism internationally. Trump's administration was characterized by a strong commitment to supporting Israel, which included substantial military aid and unwavering political backing. This support was evident in various diplomatic initiatives and public statements that aligned closely with Israeli interests.\n\nAdditionally, Trump's policies and rhetoric often reflected a pro-Israel stance, especially concerning issues related to Iran. His administration's approach to Iran, including the withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, was influenced by a desire to bolster Israel's security and counter perceived threats from Iranian influence in the region. This alignment with Israeli interests significantly impacted U.S. foreign policy decisions during his presidency, reinforcing the strategic partnership between the United States and Israel.\n\nOverall, Trump's administration is remembered for its transformative impact on U.S.-Israel relations, characterized by a strong endorsement of Israeli policies and a reorientation of American diplomatic efforts in the Middle East.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 224, "prompt_tokens": 208, "total_tokens": 432, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
