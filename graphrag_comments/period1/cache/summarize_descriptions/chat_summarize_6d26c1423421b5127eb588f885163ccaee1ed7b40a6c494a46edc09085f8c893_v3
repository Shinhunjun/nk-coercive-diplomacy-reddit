This conflict originated from the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953. The war concluded with a truce rather than a formal peace treaty, resulting in the two Koreas remaining technically still at war. \n\nSince the end of the Korean War, the relationship between North and South Korea has been characterized by persistent military standoffs and heightened tensions. The conflict has not only affected the Korean Peninsula but has also drawn in international powers, particularly the United States, which has allied with South Korea. The unresolved status of the conflict continues to influence geopolitical dynamics in the region and beyond, as both Koreas maintain a significant military presence along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates them.\n\nOverall, the Korean Conflict encapsulates a complex historical and political situation that remains unresolved, with ongoing implications for security and diplomacy in East Asia.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 199, "prompt_tokens": 286, "total_tokens": 485, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
