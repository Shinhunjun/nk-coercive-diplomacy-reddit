A significant aspect of this relationship is the concern surrounding Russia's military capabilities and its nuclear arsenal, which are viewed as critical issues for U.S. national security and defense policy. This concern is compounded by the geopolitical actions of both nations, which often lead to discussions about potential sanctions.\n\nThe US and Russia engage in ongoing dialogues regarding international sanctions, particularly in response to Russia's actions and influence on the global stage.
