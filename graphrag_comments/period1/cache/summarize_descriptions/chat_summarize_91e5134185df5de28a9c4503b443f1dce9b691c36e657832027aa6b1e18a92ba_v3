This weapon utilizes nuclear fusion to release a massive amount of energy, significantly more than traditional atomic bombs. North Korea claims that its hydrogen bomb has great destructive power and can be fitted onto intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), enhancing its military capabilities and posing a significant threat to international security.\n\nNorth Korea has conducted underground tests of its hydrogen bomb, which have raised concerns about the safety of its test facilities and the potential for geological instability, particularly at the Punggye-ri site. The country has also threatened to conduct further tests, including potential detonations over the Pacific Ocean, which has escalated tensions with the United States and other nations.\n\nThe development and testing of the hydrogen bomb by North Korea indicate advancements in its nuclear technology and military capabilities. The weapon is said to have adjustable power and can be detonated at high altitudes, further complicating the geopolitical landscape. The successful tests of the hydrogen bomb have contributed to global tensions and have led to increased sanctions against North Korea, as the international community seeks to curb its nuclear ambitions.\n\nOverall, the hydrogen bomb represents a significant advancement in North Korea's nuclear arsenal, raising alarms about the implications for regional and global security.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 265, "prompt_tokens": 933, "total_tokens": 1198, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
