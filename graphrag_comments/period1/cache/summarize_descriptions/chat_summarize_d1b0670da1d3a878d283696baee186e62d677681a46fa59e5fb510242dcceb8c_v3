The U.S. has consistently expressed concerns over North Korea's missile activity, which the North views as a necessary response to the perceived military threats posed by the U.S. presence and actions in the region. This dynamic has led to heightened tensions, with North Korea's missile tests often seen as provocative gestures aimed at countering U.S. influence and demonstrating its military capabilities.
