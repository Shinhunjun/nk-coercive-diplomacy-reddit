These exercises are intended to prepare military forces for potential real-world engagements and to enhance strategic planning and coordination. In the context of U.S. military activities near North Korea, these war games have been a focal point of tension, as they are often perceived by North Korea as provocative actions that could escalate regional hostilities. The ongoing military drills serve not only as a demonstration of military readiness but also as a means of deterrence against potential aggression from North Korea. However, the conduct of these war games has been a source of contention, with North Korea frequently condemning them and viewing them as a direct threat to its sovereignty and security.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 152, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 348, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
