These sanctions aim to cut off sources of foreign currency that are essential for North Korea's nuclear initiatives and to restrict its economic activities, particularly in response to its aggressive actions and nuclear tests.\n\nThe sanctions encompass a wide range of restrictions, including limitations on trade and economic interactions with North Korea. Specifically, they target the country's petrol imports, reducing them by up to 90% as a direct response to its nuclear tests. The overarching goal of these sanctions is to curb North Korea's nuclear proliferation activities and to limit its military capabilities.\n\nIn summary, UN sanctions are designed to restrict North Korea's activities related to its nuclear weapons program and missile tests, thereby addressing violations of international law and threats to global peace. These measures reflect the international community's commitment to preventing the further development of North Korea's nuclear capabilities and ensuring regional stability.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 191, "prompt_tokens": 525, "total_tokens": 716, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
