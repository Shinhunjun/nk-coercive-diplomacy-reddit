These missiles are designed to travel over distances greater than 5,500 kilometers, allowing them to potentially reach targets anywhere in the world, including the United States. North Korea has been actively developing and testing ICBMs as a crucial component of its military strategy, which has raised significant international concerns regarding global security.\n\nNorth Korea's ICBM program is characterized by its ambition to enhance the country's military capabilities, particularly in terms of nuclear deterrence. The development of these missiles involves sophisticated technology and resources, and North Korea has reportedly made advancements in this area, claiming successful tests of ICBMs capable of striking targets across the globe. The ICBMs are seen as a significant threat in the context of North Korea's military capabilities, as they represent a potential means of delivering nuclear weapons over long distances.\n\nThe strategic importance of ICBMs in North Korea's military doctrine cannot be overstated. They are viewed as a key element in the country's efforts to assert its power and deter adversaries. The ongoing development and testing of ICBMs have led to heightened tensions in international relations, particularly with nations such as the United States, South Korea, and Japan, which are within the range of these missiles.\n\nIn summary, ICBMs are advanced long-range missile systems that North Korea is developing to enhance its nuclear arsenal and military capabilities. Their ability to deliver nuclear warheads over vast distances poses a significant challenge to global security and is a central focus in discussions about North Korea's military ambitions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 327, "prompt_tokens": 2304, "total_tokens": 2631, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
