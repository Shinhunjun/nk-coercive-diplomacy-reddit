This collection of nuclear weapons is particularly significant in the context of North Korea, which maintains a nuclear arsenal that is a central aspect of its military strategy. North Korea's nuclear capabilities have become a major point of contention in international relations, especially in negotiations with the United States and other nations.\n\nThe existence of a nuclear arsenal is often justified by countries as a means of deterrence, aimed at preventing potential adversaries from engaging in military conflict.
