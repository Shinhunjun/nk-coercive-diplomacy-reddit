It is engineered to be launched and guided towards a specific target, making it a critical component in modern military operations. Various countries, including North Korea, have developed and tested different types of missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and nuclear-tipped variants, which have raised significant concerns regarding regional and global security.\n\nNorth Korea's missile program has garnered international attention due to its advancements and the potential threats it poses. The country has been known to develop and test a range of missile systems capable of flying at high altitudes and re-entering the Earth's atmosphere, which enhances their range and effectiveness. These developments have led to heightened tensions, particularly in the context of North Korea's military capabilities and its implications for neighboring countries and the United States.\n\nMissiles are often referenced in discussions about military conflicts, especially those involving North Korea, where they are seen as a tool for both defense and aggression. The ongoing testing of these weapons has raised alarms about their potential to disrupt regional stability and security. As such, missiles are not only a focal point of military strategy but also a significant factor in international relations and security dynamics.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 252, "prompt_tokens": 684, "total_tokens": 936, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
