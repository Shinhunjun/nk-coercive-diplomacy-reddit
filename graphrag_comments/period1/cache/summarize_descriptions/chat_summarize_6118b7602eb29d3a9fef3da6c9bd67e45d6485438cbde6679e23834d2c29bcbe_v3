This threat is primarily characterized by DPRK's nuclear capabilities, which extend to Japan and contribute to heightened regional security concerns. The potential for military aggression from DPRK has led to increased vigilance and strategic planning on the part of Japan, as well as a broader focus on security collaboration with allies in the region.
