This approach is often associated with the historical context of Europe during the 1930s, where it was employed in an attempt to maintain peace in the face of rising tensions and aggressive actions from certain nations. The policy of appeasement has been widely criticized, particularly for its perceived failure to deter aggression and its role in enabling the expansionist ambitions of totalitarian regimes. Critics argue that by conceding to the demands of aggressors, appeasement ultimately undermines the principles of justice and security, leading to greater conflicts in the long run.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 321, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
