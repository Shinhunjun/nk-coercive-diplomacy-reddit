These sanctions are designed to restrict North Korea's access to international financial systems, thereby limiting its economic capabilities. The US government has implemented these measures to exert pressure on North Korea concerning its nuclear ambitions, aiming to curb its development and proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n\nIn addition to targeting North Korea, the United States also utilizes sanctions as a means to address issues with other nations, including Russia and Iran. This approach reflects a broader strategy of enforcing international norms and promoting compliance with global standards. The US has been a significant force behind the sanctions imposed on North Korea, demonstrating its commitment to using economic pressure as a tool for foreign policy.\n\nOverall, the sanctions against North Korea serve multiple purposes: they aim to restrict trade, limit financial interactions, and compel the country to adhere to international expectations regarding its nuclear program. Through these measures, the United States seeks to foster a more stable and secure international environment.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 200, "prompt_tokens": 292, "total_tokens": 492, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
