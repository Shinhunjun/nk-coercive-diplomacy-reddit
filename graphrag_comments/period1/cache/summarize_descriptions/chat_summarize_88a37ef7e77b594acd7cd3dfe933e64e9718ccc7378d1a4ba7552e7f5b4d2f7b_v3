It serves as a key objective in international dialogues aimed at addressing North Korea's nuclear weapons program, which is a significant obstacle to achieving denuclearization. The negotiations surrounding this topic are not only crucial for North Korea but also impact its relations with major powers, particularly the United States and China.\n\nNorth Korea's nuclear ambitions are in direct conflict with the goal of denuclearization, making the nuclear program the primary focus of international negotiations. These discussions are essential for reducing North Korea's nuclear capabilities and involve various stakeholders, including South Korea, which also engages in negotiations that include denuclearization as a central theme.\n\nThe policy of denuclearization is fundamentally linked to North Korea's nuclear weapons program and is a major topic in international relations. North Korea's stance on denuclearization significantly influences its negotiations with the United States, where financial aid and other incentives are often tied to the country's willingness to denuclearize. As such, denuclearization is not only a policy goal but also a critical element of North Korea's security policy and international relations strategy.\n\nOverall, denuclearization remains a central issue in the ongoing discussions about North Korea's nuclear capabilities, with the potential to reshape the geopolitical landscape in the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 259, "prompt_tokens": 674, "total_tokens": 933, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
