These individuals are officially recognized by the Japanese government due to their unique experiences and the health issues they face as a result of radiation exposure from the bombings. The term \"Hibakusha\" not only identifies those who survived the immediate effects of the atomic blasts but also encompasses the long-term physical and psychological impacts that have affected their lives.\n\nIn addition to their status as survivors, Hibakusha play a significant role as advocates for peace and nuclear disarmament. Many of them actively campaign for the abolition of nuclear weapons, sharing their personal stories and the devastating consequences of nuclear warfare to raise awareness about the dangers of such weapons. Their testimonies serve as powerful reminders of the human cost of nuclear conflict and the importance of preventing future atrocities.\n\nThe experiences of Hibakusha are crucial in understanding the historical and ethical implications of nuclear weapons. Their advocacy efforts contribute to global discussions on disarmament and the need for policies that prioritize peace and security over military might. Through their resilience and commitment to sharing their stories, Hibakusha continue to influence public opinion and policy regarding nuclear weapons and their potential consequences.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 244, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 447, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
