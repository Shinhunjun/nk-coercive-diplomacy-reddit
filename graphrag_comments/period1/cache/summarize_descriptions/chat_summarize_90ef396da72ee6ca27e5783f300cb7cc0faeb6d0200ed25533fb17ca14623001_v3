The Chinese government is particularly concerned that THAAD's advanced missile defense technology could undermine its nuclear deterrence, potentially altering the balance of power in the region. This perception stems from the belief that THAAD's radar systems could be used to monitor Chinese missile activities, thereby compromising China's security interests. As a result, China views the presence of THAAD as not only a direct challenge to its military capabilities but also as a broader threat to its strategic stability in East Asia.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 320, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
