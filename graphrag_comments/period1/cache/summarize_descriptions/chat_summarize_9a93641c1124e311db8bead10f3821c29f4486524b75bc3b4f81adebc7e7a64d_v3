His leadership came to an end during the Libyan civil war, a conflict that was significantly influenced by NATO intervention. This military involvement played a crucial role in the dynamics of the civil war, ultimately leading to Qaddafi's ousting from power. It is important to note that his deposition was not directly related to nuclear weapons, indicating that the factors leading to his downfall were more complex and rooted in the political and social unrest within Libya rather than issues surrounding nuclear armament. Qaddafi's regime was marked by a mix of authoritarian governance and attempts at social reform, but it ultimately faced widespread opposition, culminating in his removal from power during the tumultuous events of the civil war.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 352, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
