They experience significant hardships, including severe food shortages, which impact their daily lives and overall well-being. The citizens are subjected to strict government control, which permeates various aspects of their existence, from their access to information to their personal freedoms. \n\nThe regime employs extensive propaganda to shape the perceptions and beliefs of its citizens, ensuring that the narrative presented aligns with the government's interests.
