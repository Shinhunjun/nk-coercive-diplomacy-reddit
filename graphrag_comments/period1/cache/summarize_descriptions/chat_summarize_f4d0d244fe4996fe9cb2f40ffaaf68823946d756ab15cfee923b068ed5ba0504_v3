Initially, North Korea signed the NPT, which aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and promote peaceful uses of nuclear energy. However, the country later withdrew from the treaty, a move that has raised serious questions about its commitment to nonproliferation efforts.\n\nThe actions taken by North Korea regarding its nuclear program have been widely viewed as violations of the NPT. This noncompliance has not only strained North Korea's relations with other nations but has also heightened global concerns about nuclear proliferation. The refusal of North Korea to adhere to the stipulations of the NPT is a critical factor influencing international discourse on nuclear weapons and security.\n\nOverall, North Korea's nuclear ambitions and its contentious history with the NPT underscore the complexities of global nuclear governance and the challenges posed by states that pursue nuclear capabilities outside of established international frameworks.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 198, "prompt_tokens": 259, "total_tokens": 457, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
