It is primarily used to detain suspected terrorists and enemy combatants. The facility has been a focal point of international controversy and debate, particularly regarding human rights and the treatment of detainees. Gitmo's establishment was part of the U.S. government's response to the September 11 attacks in 2001, aiming to hold individuals deemed a threat to national security without the same legal protections afforded in civilian courts. Over the years, Gitmo has housed a variety of detainees, some of whom have been held for extended periods without trial. The camp's operations and the legal status of its detainees have raised significant ethical and legal questions, contributing to ongoing discussions about the balance between national security and human rights.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 365, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
