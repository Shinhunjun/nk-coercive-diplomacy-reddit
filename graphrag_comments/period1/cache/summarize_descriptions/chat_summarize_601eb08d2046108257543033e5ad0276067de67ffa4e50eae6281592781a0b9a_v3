This activity is often conducted by countries such as North Korea, which has engaged in multiple missile tests to demonstrate its military strength and advancements in missile technology. These tests have significant implications for international relations, particularly escalating tensions with other nations, including the United States and its allies.\n\nNorth Korea's missile tests are particularly noteworthy as they aim to advance the country's long-range missile technology, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Such tests have raised international concerns regarding North Korea's nuclear capabilities and intentions, prompting responses from various countries. For instance, the missile test conducted by North Korea on July 4, 2017, showcased its ability to reach the United States, marking a pivotal moment in the country's military history.\n\nIn addition to North Korea, other countries, such as China and South Korea, also conduct missile tests. China may perform missile tests to validate its capabilities, influenced by geopolitical factors such as the presence of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. Meanwhile, South Korea conducts live-fire missile tests as a direct response to North Korean provocations, highlighting the regional tensions that arise from these military exercises.\n\nOverall, missile tests are significant military events that not only reflect a country's technological advancements but also serve as a barometer for international relations and security dynamics. The actions taken by North Korea, in particular, have been pivotal in shaping the discourse around missile capabilities and nuclear threats, leading to heightened vigilance and strategic responses from other nations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 311, "prompt_tokens": 574, "total_tokens": 885, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
