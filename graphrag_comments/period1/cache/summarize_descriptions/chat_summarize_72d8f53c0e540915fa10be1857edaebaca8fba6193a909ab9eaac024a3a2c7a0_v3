Established in 1921, the CCP has played a central role in the governance and policy-making of the country. As the sole governing party, it has maintained a significant influence over China's political landscape, shaping its domestic and foreign policies.\n\nThe CCP is also known for its involvement in the ongoing conflict with Taiwan. This conflict stems from the Chinese Civil War, which led to the establishment of the People's Republic of China on the mainland and the Republic of China (ROC) government retreating to Taiwan in 1949. The CCP views Taiwan as a breakaway province that must eventually be reunified with the mainland, a stance that has led to heightened tensions and complex diplomatic relations in the region.\n\nOverall, the CCP's governance is characterized by its commitment to maintaining a one-party state, where it exercises control over various aspects of life in China, including the economy, media, and civil society. The party's policies and actions continue to have significant implications for both domestic affairs and international relations, particularly regarding Taiwan.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 223, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 419, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
