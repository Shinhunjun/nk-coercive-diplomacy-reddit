Coal is one of North Korea's significant natural resources, and its exportation has been a vital source of revenue for the regime. Despite being under international sanctions aimed at curbing its nuclear weapons program and military capabilities, North Korea continues to engage in coal exports. These sanctions have been imposed due to the country's ongoing development of its military and nuclear arsenal, yet the coal trade remains a key component of its economic activities.
