His potential decision to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics is viewed as a diplomatic overture, indicating a willingness to engage with the international community. This move is seen as a strategic effort to enhance North Korea's global image, particularly in light of the country's often contentious international relations.\n\nAdditionally, Kim Jong Un's prominence was underscored during the Winter Olympics by the presence of impersonators, which highlights his global recognition and the impact of his leadership on international events. The decision to send athletes to the Winter Olympics is not merely a sporting gesture; it is part of a broader strategy to reshape perceptions of North Korea on the world stage.
