This policy goal is often discussed in the context of international negotiations involving North Korea, the United States, and South Korea. Denuclearization seeks the complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantling of North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, which has been a significant point of contention in diplomatic discussions.\n\nThe concept of denuclearization encompasses North Korea's demands for the removal of its nuclear weapons in exchange for various forms of financial aid and resources, as well as relief from international sanctions. It is a central theme in peace negotiations, not only between North Korea and the United States but also in inter-Korean talks. The policy is framed as a necessary step towards achieving stability and security in the region, as well as a means to foster better relations between North Korea and the international community.\n\nDespite the emphasis on denuclearization in negotiations, North Korea has yet to fulfill its commitments regarding its nuclear weapons program, which complicates international relations and ongoing discussions. The process of denuclearization is often characterized by its complexity, as it involves multiple stakeholders and varying interests, making it a challenging goal to achieve.\n\nOverall, denuclearization represents a critical objective in the context of North Korea's nuclear program, with implications for regional and global security. It remains a focal point in diplomatic efforts aimed at addressing the threats posed by nuclear proliferation and ensuring a peaceful resolution to the tensions surrounding North Korea's military capabilities.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 305, "prompt_tokens": 886, "total_tokens": 1191, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
