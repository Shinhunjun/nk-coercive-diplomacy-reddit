These summits are primarily focused on discussions surrounding denuclearization and the improvement of diplomatic relations on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe summit between Kim Jong Un and Moon Jae-In is particularly significant as it represents a direct dialogue between North and South Korea, aimed at fostering peace and addressing the ongoing tensions in the region.
