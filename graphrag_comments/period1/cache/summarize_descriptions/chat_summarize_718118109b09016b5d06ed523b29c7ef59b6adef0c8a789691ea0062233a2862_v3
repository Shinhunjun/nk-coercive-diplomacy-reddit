This political system is often marked by oppressive rule and the suppression of political opposition. A notable example of dictatorship is North Korea, where the government exerts tight control over various aspects of life and limits dissent. In such regimes, the ruling authority typically maintains power through authoritarian measures, restricting freedoms and curtailing civil liberties to eliminate challenges to their authority. Overall, dictatorship is characterized by a lack of democratic processes and the absence of checks and balances that are fundamental to more democratic forms of governance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 123, "prompt_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 332, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
