This international organization has imposed a series of sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's capabilities in these areas, which are viewed as significant threats to global security. The UN's actions are a direct response to North Korea's nuclear tests and its violations of international law, reflecting the international community's commitment to non-proliferation and the maintenance of peace.\n\nThrough these sanctions, the United Nations seeks to pressure North Korea to comply with international norms and to engage in dialogue regarding its nuclear program. The measures include restrictions on trade, financial transactions, and the export of certain goods and technologies that could contribute to North Korea's military advancements. The UN's involvement underscores the seriousness of the situation and the collective effort to address the challenges posed by North Korea's actions on the global stage.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 179, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 371, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
