This war, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, arose from the division of Korea at the end of World War II and the subsequent invasion of South Korea by North Korean forces. The United States, under the auspices of the United Nations, intervened militarily to assist South Korea, marking a pivotal moment in the Cold War era.\n\nThe involvement of the US in the Korean War had lasting implications for its relations with North Korea. The conflict solidified the division of the Korean Peninsula into two separate states, with the US maintaining a military presence in South Korea to deter further aggression from the North. This military commitment has continued for decades, contributing to a complex and often tense relationship between the US and North Korea.\n\nOverall, the Korean War not only shaped the geopolitical landscape of East Asia but also established a framework for US foreign policy in the region, influencing its interactions with both Koreas in the years that followed. The legacy of the war continues to affect US-North Korea relations to this day, as the two nations navigate a fraught history marked by conflict, diplomacy, and ongoing tensions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 249, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 430, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
