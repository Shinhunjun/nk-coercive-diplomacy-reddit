This term is frequently discussed in the context of historical military actions and foreign policy, highlighting its relevance in understanding the implications of state-sponsored violence and human rights violations. A notable example of genocide occurred during the Balkan wars, where the Serbs were implicated in the systematic extermination of particular ethnic groups. This dark chapter in history underscores the severe consequences of ethnic conflict and the importance of recognizing and addressing the factors that lead to such atrocities. Overall, genocide represents a profound violation of human rights and serves as a critical reminder of the need for vigilance and intervention to prevent such acts in the future.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 146, "prompt_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 344, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
