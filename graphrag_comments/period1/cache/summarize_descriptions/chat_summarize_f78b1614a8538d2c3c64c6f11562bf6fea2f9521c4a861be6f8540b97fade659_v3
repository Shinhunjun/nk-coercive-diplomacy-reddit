This war played a crucial role in shaping the geopolitical landscape of the Korean Peninsula, ultimately leading to the establishment of the current division between the two nations. The conflict began when North Korea, backed by the Soviet Union and China, invaded South Korea, prompting a response from the United Nations, primarily led by the United States. The war resulted in extensive military engagements and significant loss of life on both sides, as well as widespread destruction across the Korean Peninsula. The hostilities officially ended with an armistice agreement in 1953, but no formal peace treaty was ever signed, leaving the two Koreas technically still at war. The First Korean War solidified the ideological divide between the communist North and the democratic South, a division that continues to influence relations in the region to this day.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 182, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 389, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
