A notable example of this phenomenon is the famine in North Korea, which has emerged as a significant humanitarian crisis. This particular famine is largely attributed to government policies that prioritize military strength over the welfare of the population, leading to dire consequences for food security.\n\nThe famine in North Korea became particularly acute following the fall of the Soviet Union, which had previously provided substantial support to the country. The collapse of this support system resulted in severe food shortages, causing immense suffering among the North Korean populace. The government's focus on military might has further compounded the issue, diverting resources away from essential needs such as food production and distribution.\n\nHistorically, the famine in North Korea has had a profound impact on the country and its citizens, leading to widespread hunger and malnutrition. The interplay of political decisions, economic challenges, and environmental factors has created a persistent state of food insecurity, making famine a recurring issue in the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 215, "prompt_tokens": 276, "total_tokens": 491, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
