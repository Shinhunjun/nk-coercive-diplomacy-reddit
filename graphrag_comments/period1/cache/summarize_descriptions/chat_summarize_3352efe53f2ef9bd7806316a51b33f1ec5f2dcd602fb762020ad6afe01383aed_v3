Security Council is a principal organ of the United Nations tasked with the critical responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. This international body plays a significant role in addressing global conflicts and has been particularly involved in discussions regarding the situation on the Korean peninsula. \n\nOne of the key actions taken by the U.N. Security Council has been the imposition of sanctions on North Korea. These sanctions have been a response to North Korea's nuclear ambitions and its missile tests, which have raised concerns among member states regarding regional and global security. The Council has voted to impose various sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's military capabilities and restricting its access to resources. \n\nAmong the sanctions imposed, the U.N. Security Council has banned the provision of cash to the North Korean regime, reflecting its commitment to limiting the financial resources available for military development. The Council's actions are part of a broader strategy to pressure North Korea into compliance with international norms and to encourage denuclearization.\n\nOverall, the U.N. Security Council remains a pivotal entity in the international community, actively working to address threats to peace and security, particularly in relation to North Korea's provocative actions and its ongoing pursuit of nuclear weapons.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 238, "prompt_tokens": 369, "total_tokens": 607, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
