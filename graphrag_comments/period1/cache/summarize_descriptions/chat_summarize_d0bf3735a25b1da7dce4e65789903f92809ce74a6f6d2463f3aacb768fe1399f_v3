This event marked a pivotal moment in international relations, as it was widely viewed as an act of territorial expansion by Russia. The annexation has led to ongoing discussions about territorial integrity and the implications for international law and sovereignty.\n\nSince the annexation, Crimea has been consolidated by Russia, which has further complicated the political landscape in the region.
