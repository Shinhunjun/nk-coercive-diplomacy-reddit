Throughout his career, Bolton has been an advocate for military action against North Korea and has been involved in discussions regarding the country's denuclearization. He has notably suggested a \"Libya model\" for this process, a proposal that has drawn significant criticism due to its implications and the historical context of Libya's disarmament.\n\nBolton's views on North Korea are characterized by a strong belief in the necessity of a robust military posture and a willingness to consider aggressive strategies. His tenure as National Security Advisor was marked by a focus on confronting North Korea's nuclear ambitions, and he has been a vocal proponent of taking a hardline approach in negotiations and policy formulation.\n\nIn addition to his specific focus on North Korea, Bolton's broader foreign policy perspective is defined by a commitment to assertive American leadership on the global stage. His views often reflect a skepticism of diplomatic engagement, favoring instead a strategy that emphasizes military readiness and the potential for direct action.\n\nOverall, John Bolton's legacy in U.S. foreign policy is shaped by his controversial positions and his influential role in shaping the national security discourse, particularly regarding North Korea. His advocacy for military solutions and his critical stance on diplomatic negotiations continue to resonate in discussions about U.S. foreign policy strategies.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 279, "prompt_tokens": 350, "total_tokens": 629, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
