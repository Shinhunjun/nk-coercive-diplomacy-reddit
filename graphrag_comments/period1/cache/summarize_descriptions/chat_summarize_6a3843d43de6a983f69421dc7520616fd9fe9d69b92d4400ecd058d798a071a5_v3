During his administration, Trump engaged in diplomatic relations with North Korea, which notably affected the country's international standing. His approach included high-profile summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, aimed at denuclearization and reducing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. These diplomatic efforts marked a departure from previous U.S. policies, which often emphasized isolation and sanctions.\n\nHowever, Trump's statements and policies towards North Korea have also been characterized as aggressive. His rhetoric often contributed to the perception of an imminent threat from North Korea, as he frequently referred to the country in a confrontational manner. This duality in Trump's approach—combining diplomacy with aggressive posturing—created a complex dynamic in U.S.-North Korea relations.\n\nOverall, Trump's foreign policy towards North Korea reflects a blend of engagement and confrontation, significantly shaping the geopolitical landscape in the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 183, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 382, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
