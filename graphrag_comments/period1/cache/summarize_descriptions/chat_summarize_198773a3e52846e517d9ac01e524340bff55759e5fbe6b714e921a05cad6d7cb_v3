The primary concern for China revolves around the radar capabilities of THAAD, which are perceived to have the potential to monitor Chinese territory. This capability raises significant security concerns for China, as it views the system as a direct threat to its national security interests.\n\nFurthermore, China's opposition is not limited to the technical aspects of THAAD's radar; it also encompasses broader military implications. The deployment of THAAD in South Korea is seen by China as a strategic move that could alter the balance of power in the region, thereby exacerbating security tensions. As a result, China has consistently voiced its disapproval of the THAAD system, arguing that it undermines regional stability and poses a risk to its own security framework. \n\nIn summary, China's stance against THAAD is rooted in its apprehension regarding the system's surveillance capabilities and the potential military threats it poses, leading to a broader concern about the implications for regional security dynamics.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 209, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 416, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
