The pursuit of nuclear capabilities is not only a significant aspect of the DPRK's defense strategy but also a central element of its foreign policy and international relations, particularly with countries such as the United States.\n\nNorth Korea's nuclear ambitions are driven by a desire to enhance its security and deterrence capabilities. The regime views the development of nuclear weapons as essential for safeguarding its sovereignty and deterring potential threats from adversaries. This focus on nuclear armament has led to a series of tests and advancements in their nuclear program, which have drawn widespread international attention and concern.\n\nThe DPRK's nuclear weapons program is a pivotal factor influencing its diplomatic interactions and negotiations with other nations. The ongoing tensions surrounding its nuclear capabilities have made it a central issue in discussions regarding regional security and stability in East Asia. As a result, the DPRK's nuclear development is not only a matter of national defense but also a significant point of contention in its relations with the global community.\n\nIn summary, the DPRK's commitment to developing nuclear weapons is a defining characteristic of its military strategy and a key element in shaping its foreign policy, particularly in relation to the United States and other nations. This focus on nuclear capabilities underscores the regime's approach to ensuring its security and asserting its position on the international stage.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 295, "prompt_tokens": 303, "total_tokens": 598, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
