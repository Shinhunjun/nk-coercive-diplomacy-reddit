His approach to foreign policy was marked by a more confrontational stance compared to previous administrations, which often favored diplomatic engagement and multilateralism. Trump's tenure saw a shift in the dynamics of international relations, as he prioritized direct negotiations and personal diplomacy, exemplified by his historic summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. This approach aimed to address the nuclear threat posed by North Korea but also led to tensions with traditional allies and a reevaluation of longstanding diplomatic norms. Overall, Trump's foreign policy was characterized by a willingness to challenge established protocols and a focus on unilateral action, reshaping the landscape of U.S. interactions on the global stage.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 153, "prompt_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 336, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
