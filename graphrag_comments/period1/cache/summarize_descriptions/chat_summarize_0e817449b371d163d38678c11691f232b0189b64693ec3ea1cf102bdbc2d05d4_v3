These scientists are directly involved in the development and testing of nuclear capabilities, contributing to the regime's efforts to enhance its military power and assert its position on the global stage. However, their involvement in such high-stakes projects also places them at significant risk, particularly from the potential fallout associated with nuclear tests.
