He has often contrasted this agreement with his own diplomatic approach towards North Korea, suggesting that his strategies differ significantly from those employed in the Iran negotiations. \n\nIn 2018, Trump made the pivotal decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran Deal, a move that has had significant implications for international relations and perceptions of U.S. reliability in diplomatic negotiations. This withdrawal was part of Trump's broader foreign policy agenda, which emphasized a more confrontational stance towards Iran, arguing that the deal was flawed and did not adequately prevent Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons or address its regional activities.\n\nThe decision to exit the Iran Deal has led to increased tensions between the United States and Iran, as well as a reevaluation of U.S. commitments in international agreements. Critics of Trump's withdrawal argue that it undermined the credibility of the U.S. as a negotiating partner, potentially complicating future diplomatic efforts not only with Iran but also with other nations observing the U.S. approach to international agreements. \n\nOverall, Trump's actions regarding the Iran Deal reflect his administration's broader strategy of prioritizing a more aggressive stance in foreign policy, particularly in relation to nations perceived as adversaries.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 275, "prompt_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 465, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
