It is known for its potential use as a biological weapon due to its lethality and the ease with which it can be disseminated. In recent discussions, anthrax has been highlighted in the context of threats posed by North Korea, which is reportedly testing this deadly bacterium for potential deployment with intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). This raises significant concerns regarding biosecurity and the implications of biological warfare, as anthrax can be weaponized and used to inflict harm on populations. The combination of its infectious nature and the advancements in missile technology underscores the seriousness of the threat posed by North Korea's interest in anthrax as a biological weapon.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 147, "prompt_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 366, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
