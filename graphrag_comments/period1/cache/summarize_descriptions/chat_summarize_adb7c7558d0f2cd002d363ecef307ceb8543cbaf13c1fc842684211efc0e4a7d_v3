These sanctions serve multiple strategic purposes, including the manipulation of North Korean leadership and exerting pressure on the regime regarding its nuclear weapons program. The U.S. has specifically imposed sanctions in response to North Korea's nuclear tests and ongoing human rights abuses, aiming to curtail its capabilities and influence.\n\nIn addition to targeting North Korea, the United States has also considered the possibility of imposing sanctions on South Korea. This potential action is aimed at preventing South Korea from pursuing its own nuclear capabilities, reflecting the U.S. commitment to non-proliferation in the region. Overall, the United States utilizes sanctions as a critical policy tool to address the complex challenges posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions and to maintain stability in East Asia.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 431, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
