Russia perceives itself as being encircled by the US and its allies, a sentiment that shapes its strategic decisions and foreign policy. This feeling of encirclement stems from various factors, including NATO's expansion and the presence of US military forces in regions close to Russian borders. As a result, Russia's geopolitical strategies are often defensive in nature, aimed at countering what it views as a threat to its national security and sphere of influence.\n\nThe relationship between the US and Russia is marked by frequent opposition in international conflicts and political arenas. Both nations have historically found themselves on opposite sides of various global issues, leading to heightened tensions and a lack of trust. This adversarial dynamic is evident in their interactions in regions such as Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, where their interests often clash.\n\nOverall, the interplay between Russia's perception of encirclement and the US's strategic objectives contributes to a fraught relationship characterized by rivalry and competition on the world stage.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 214, "prompt_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 397, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
