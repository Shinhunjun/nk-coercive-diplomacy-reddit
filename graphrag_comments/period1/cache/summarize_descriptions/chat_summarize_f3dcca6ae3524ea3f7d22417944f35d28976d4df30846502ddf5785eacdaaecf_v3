His administration's approach marked a notable shift in the dynamics of U.S. diplomacy, characterized by direct engagement with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. This unprecedented strategy aimed to address nuclear proliferation concerns and foster dialogue, although it received mixed reactions domestically and internationally.\n\nIn addition to his dealings with North Korea, Trump's policies also contributed to a broader realignment of America's global alliances. His administration's stance appeared to favor closer ties with Russia, which contrasted sharply with traditional U.S. alliances in Europe. This shift raised concerns among European allies about the future of transatlantic relations and the collective security framework established after World War II.\n\nOverall, Trump's presidency was marked by a distinctive approach to foreign policy that sought to redefine America's role on the global stage, emphasizing bilateral relationships and a more transactional view of international alliances.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 182, "prompt_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 361, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
