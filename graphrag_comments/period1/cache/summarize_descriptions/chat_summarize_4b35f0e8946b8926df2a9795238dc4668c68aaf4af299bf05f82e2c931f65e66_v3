This energy output is significantly greater than that of traditional atomic bombs, such as the ones dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which are based on nuclear fission. The explosive yield of an H-bomb can reach into the megaton range, making it one of the most destructive weapons known to humanity.\n\nThe H-bomb operates by combining light atomic nuclei, typically isotopes of hydrogen, under extreme temperatures and pressures, resulting in a fusion reaction that produces a far more powerful explosion than fission-based weapons. This capability to generate such a vast amount of energy is what distinguishes the H-bomb from atomic bombs, which primarily rely on splitting heavy atomic nuclei.\n\nIn recent history, the H-bomb has been a focal point of international tensions, particularly with North Korea, which has claimed to have successfully tested this type of nuclear weapon. Such claims have raised alarms and escalated geopolitical tensions, especially with the United States and its allies, who view the proliferation of H-bomb technology as a significant threat to global security.\n\nOverall, the H-bomb represents a critical advancement in nuclear weaponry, characterized by its unparalleled destructive potential and the complex scientific principles underlying its operation.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 273, "prompt_tokens": 310, "total_tokens": 583, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
