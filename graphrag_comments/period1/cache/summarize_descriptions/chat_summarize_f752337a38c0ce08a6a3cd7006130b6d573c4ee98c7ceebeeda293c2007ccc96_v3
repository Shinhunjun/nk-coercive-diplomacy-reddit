This investment is not only financial but also extends to military and political support, which plays a crucial role in Syria's stability and security. The loss of Iranian support would likely weaken Syria, highlighting the importance of Iran's involvement in the region.\n\nIran's military strategy is closely tied to its influence over Syria, as it views Syria as a critical ally in its broader regional ambitions. This influence is particularly relevant in discussions about regional security, where Iran's presence in Syria is seen as a means to project power and counterbalance rival influences in the Middle East. The relationship between Iran and Syria is thus characterized by mutual dependence, with Iran's support being vital for Syria's ongoing conflict and reconstruction efforts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 157, "prompt_tokens": 177, "total_tokens": 334, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
