This area is not only a political boundary but also a critical military zone where North Korea has strategically positioned its artillery. The DMZ, established at the end of the Korean War in 1953, spans approximately 250 kilometers (160 miles) across the Korean Peninsula and is one of the most fortified borders in the world. It symbolizes the ongoing tensions and division between the two Koreas, with North Korea maintaining a substantial military presence in the region. The positioning of artillery within the DMZ underscores the military readiness and strategic posturing of North Korea, highlighting the fragile peace that exists in this area.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 148, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 339, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
