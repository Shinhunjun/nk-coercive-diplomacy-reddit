This initiative was primarily a result of negotiations between the United States and North Korea, focusing on freezing North Korea's nuclear weapons program. The framework represented an attempt by the U.S. to halt the development of nuclear capabilities in North Korea through diplomatic means.\n\nThe Agreed Framework sought to limit North Korea's nuclear program by establishing a series of commitments and incentives for compliance. However, despite these efforts, North Korea ultimately violated the terms of the agreement, which raised concerns about the effectiveness of diplomatic negotiations in addressing the country's nuclear ambitions. The framework highlighted the complexities and challenges involved in managing international relations and nuclear non-proliferation efforts in the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 153, "prompt_tokens": 266, "total_tokens": 419, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
