His actions have sparked significant public debate surrounding issues of privacy, security, and the extent of government oversight in the digital age. Snowden's disclosures revealed the scale and scope of surveillance practices employed by the NSA, which included the collection of data from millions of individuals without their consent. This revelation raised critical questions about civil liberties, the right to privacy, and the balance between national security and individual freedoms. As a result, Snowden has become a polarizing figure, viewed by some as a whistleblower and a champion of privacy rights, while others see him as a traitor who compromised national security. His leaks have had a lasting impact on discussions about the ethics of surveillance and the need for transparency in government operations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 370, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
