The Russian government often engages in dialogues that address the implications of North Korea's actions on regional stability and security. \n\nDespite the global concerns regarding North Korea's nuclear weapons program, Russia exhibits a preference for the DPRK's stability. This stance suggests that Russia is willing to tolerate the continuation of North Korea's nuclear development as a means to ensure the regime's survival and prevent potential chaos on its borders. The Kremlin's approach reflects a broader strategy aimed at balancing its interests in the region, which includes maintaining influence over North Korea while navigating the complexities of international relations, particularly with Western nations advocating for denuclearization.\n\nIn summary, Russia's relationship with the DPRK is shaped by a pragmatic desire for stability, even at the cost of allowing the continuation of nuclear armament, as it seeks to manage the geopolitical landscape in Northeast Asia.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 195, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 386, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
