It serves as the primary site for the country's nuclear testing activities. Over the years, Mount Mantap has been the focal point of multiple nuclear tests, which have reportedly led to substantial geological changes in the area. \n\nThe mountain is characterized by its role as the foundation for the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, where a series of nuclear detonations have taken place. These tests have not only contributed to the development of North Korea's nuclear capabilities but have also caused considerable damage to the mountain itself. Reports indicate that the repeated nuclear blasts have resulted in a collapse of certain sections of Mount Mantap, raising concerns about the stability of the site and the potential for further geological repercussions.\n\nIn summary, Mount Mantap is intrinsically linked to North Korea's nuclear ambitions, serving as the site of significant nuclear testing that has altered its geological structure and raised alarms regarding the safety and environmental impact of such activities.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 202, "prompt_tokens": 248, "total_tokens": 450, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
