Trump’s approach included both diplomatic efforts and military threats, reflecting a dual strategy of negotiation and pressure.\n\nTrump's administration prioritized addressing North Korea's nuclear ambitions, which were a significant concern for U.S. foreign policy. He made numerous statements regarding North Korea's military capabilities, often accompanied by threats of military action if the regime did not comply with international demands. This confrontational rhetoric included remarks about the potential destruction of North Korea if it posed a threat to the United States or its allies, which heightened fears of military conflict.\n\nDespite the aggressive stance, Trump also sought to engage in diplomacy, participating in direct negotiations and summits with North Korean officials. His administration aimed to foster peace and denuclearization, although these efforts were often complicated by North Korea's continued missile tests and nuclear developments.
