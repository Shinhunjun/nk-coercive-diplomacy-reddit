These readings provide valuable data regarding the magnitude and impact of explosions during nuclear tests, allowing scientists and researchers to evaluate the effects of such detonations on the surrounding environment. Additionally, seismic readings serve as indicators of the strength and occurrence of earthquakes, which can sometimes be linked to the activities associated with nuclear testing. By analyzing these measurements, experts can gain insights into the geological and physical phenomena occurring in a given area, thereby enhancing the understanding of both human-made and natural seismic activities.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 300, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
