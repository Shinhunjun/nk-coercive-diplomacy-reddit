This policy is closely associated with former South Korean leaders Kim Dae-jung and Chung Dong-young, who championed its implementation. The primary objective of the Sunshine Policy was to foster a peaceful and cooperative relationship with North Korea, promoting dialogue and economic collaboration.\n\nThe policy emphasized the importance of engagement rather than confrontation, aiming to create a more stable and peaceful Korean Peninsula. It sought to address historical tensions and encourage North Korea to participate in cooperative ventures, which included economic assistance and cultural exchanges. The Sunshine Policy represented a shift in South Korea's approach to its northern neighbor, moving from a stance of hostility to one of potential partnership.\n\nHowever, the Sunshine Policy faced challenges and ultimately ended due to various violations and setbacks. These included North Korea's continued military provocations and nuclear weapons development, which undermined the trust necessary for the policy's success. Despite its initial intentions and some positive outcomes during its implementation, the policy's effectiveness was hampered by the complex and often adversarial nature of inter-Korean relations.\n\nIn summary, the Sunshine Policy was a South Korean strategy aimed at improving relations with North Korea through engagement and economic cooperation, associated with key political figures like Kim Dae-jung and Chung Dong-young. While it sought to promote peace and collaboration, the policy ultimately concluded due to ongoing violations and challenges in the relationship between the two Koreas.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 292, "prompt_tokens": 237, "total_tokens": 529, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
