His invasion of Kuwait in 1990 marked a significant turning point, triggering the Gulf War and prompting a robust international military response. This aggressive move not only highlighted the contentious relationship between Saddam's Iraq and Kuwait but also underscored the broader implications for regional stability and international relations. The invasion was characterized by a swift military campaign that aimed to annex Kuwait, which Saddam viewed as a strategic asset. However, this act of aggression galvanized a coalition of nations, led by the United States, to intervene militarily in defense of Kuwait, ultimately leading to the liberation of the country and a decisive defeat for Iraqi forces. Thus, the events surrounding Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait are critical to understanding the dynamics of Middle Eastern politics and the international community's response to acts of aggression.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 175, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 364, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
