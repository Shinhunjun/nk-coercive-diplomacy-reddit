He held power before Kim Jong Un succeeded him, passing on the leadership role to his son. Kim Jong Un inherited the position of leader in North Korea from Kim Jong Il, continuing many of his father's policies, particularly those related to nuclear weapons and international negotiations. In his leadership, Kim Jong Un has sought to emulate the strategies employed by Kim Jong Il, maintaining a strong focus on the development and enhancement of North Korea's nuclear capabilities.
