His rule was marked by a mix of populist rhetoric and oppressive governance, which included the suppression of dissent and the establishment of a cult of personality. Qaddafi's leadership came to an end during the Libyan Civil War, a conflict that erupted in early 2011 as part of the broader wave of protests and uprisings known as the Arab Spring.\n\nThe civil war in Libya was characterized by widespread violence and significant international involvement. As the conflict escalated, various factions emerged, and Qaddafi's forces faced increasing opposition from rebel groups. The situation prompted international military intervention, primarily led by NATO, which aimed to protect civilians and support the rebels against Qaddafi's regime. This intervention played a crucial role in the eventual downfall of Qaddafi, who was ultimately captured and killed by rebel forces in October 2011.\n\nQaddafi's ousting marked a significant turning point in Libya's history, leading to a power vacuum and ongoing struggles for control among various factions in the years that followed. His regime's legacy remains a contentious topic, as Libya continues to grapple with the consequences of his rule and the subsequent civil unrest.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 262, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 451, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
