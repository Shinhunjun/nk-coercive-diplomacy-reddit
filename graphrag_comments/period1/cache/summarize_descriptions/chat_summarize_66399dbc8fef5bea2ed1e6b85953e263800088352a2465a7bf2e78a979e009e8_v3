Historically, Vietnam has experienced significant military conflicts, including notable engagements with China and the United States. The Vietnam War, a major conflict involving the U.S. military, resulted in numerous civilian casualties and has left a lasting impact on the nation's history and international relations.\n\nIn recent years, Vietnam has been improving its diplomatic and economic relations with the United States, positioning itself as a strategic ally in the region. This shift is partly due to Vietnam's desire to counterbalance China's growing influence in Southeast Asia. As a result, Vietnam is increasingly viewed as a bulwark against Chinese expansionism, enhancing its economic competitiveness at China's expense.\n\nVietnam's historical ties with both China and the United States are significant, as they shape its current foreign policy and regional dynamics. The country is involved in ongoing disputes in the South China Sea, where territorial claims and maritime rights are contentious issues. These disputes further illustrate Vietnam's complex relationship with China, which is often characterized by rivalry and competition.\n\nAdditionally, Vietnam is referenced in discussions about military engagement and international relations, drawing comparisons to other conflicts, such as those involving North Korea. This context highlights Vietnam's role as a potential ally in broader geopolitical discussions, particularly in the context of U.S. interests in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nOverall, Vietnam's historical conflicts, evolving relationships, and strategic positioning in Southeast Asia underscore its importance in regional and global affairs. The country continues to navigate its past while forging a path toward a more influential role on the international stage.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 320, "prompt_tokens": 347, "total_tokens": 667, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
