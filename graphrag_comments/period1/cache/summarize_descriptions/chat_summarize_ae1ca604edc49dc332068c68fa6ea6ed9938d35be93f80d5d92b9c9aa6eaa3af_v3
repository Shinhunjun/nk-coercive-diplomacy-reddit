Recently, it has taken significant actions against North Korea, particularly in response to the country's development of weapons of mass destruction. The U.S. Treasury announced additional sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's capabilities in this area, reflecting the United States' ongoing commitment to addressing threats posed by the regime.\n\nIn a related effort, the U.S. Treasury also imposed sanctions on the owner of the UAL Ji Bong 6, a vessel identified for its role in delivering coal from North Korea. This action underscores the Treasury's broader strategy to target entities and individuals that facilitate North Korea's illicit trade and contribute to its economic activities that violate international sanctions. Through these measures, the U.S. Treasury aims to pressure North Korea to abandon its weapons programs and adhere to international norms.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 173, "prompt_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 370, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
