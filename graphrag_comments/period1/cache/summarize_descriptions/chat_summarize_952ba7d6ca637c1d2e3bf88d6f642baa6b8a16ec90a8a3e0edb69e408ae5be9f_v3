This stance is often highlighted in its foreign policy discussions, where the US emphasizes the importance of human rights as a fundamental aspect of global governance and international relations. However, the US's approach to human rights is not without controversy. Critics argue that the US exhibits selective attention to human rights abuses, focusing on certain countries while overlooking or downplaying violations in others, particularly when strategic interests are at stake. This perceived inconsistency raises questions about the sincerity and effectiveness of the US's commitment to promoting human rights globally. Overall, while the US advocates for human rights and holds other nations accountable, its foreign policy is scrutinized for its uneven application of these principles.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 160, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 346, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
