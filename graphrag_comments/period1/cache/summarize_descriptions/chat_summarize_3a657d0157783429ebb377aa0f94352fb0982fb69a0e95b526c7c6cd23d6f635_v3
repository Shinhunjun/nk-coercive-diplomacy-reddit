These tests often attract significant international scrutiny and can lead to heightened geopolitical tensions. A prominent example of this is the series of nuclear tests conducted by North Korea, which have sparked widespread international protests and diplomatic actions aimed at addressing the security concerns they raise.\n\nNorth Korea's nuclear tests have been particularly notable, with the country conducting a total of six tests to date.
