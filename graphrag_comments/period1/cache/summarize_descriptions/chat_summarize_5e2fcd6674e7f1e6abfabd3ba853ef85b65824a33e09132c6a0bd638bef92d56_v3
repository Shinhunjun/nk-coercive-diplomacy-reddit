In the context of the United States, weapons are often sold to allied nations such as South Korea and Japan, significantly influencing the regional security landscape. These military arms and munitions are not only essential for defense but also serve as instruments of power and deterrence in conflicts.\n\nHistorically, the development and deployment of weapons have been guided by strategic plans, including those established by the grandson of an initial king, who aimed to prepare for warfare. This historical perspective underscores the long-standing importance of weapons in military strategy and national defense.\n\nIn summary, weapons encompass a wide range of military tools that are integral to both the preparation for and execution of warfare, shaping the dynamics of international relations and regional security. Their role extends beyond mere physical instruments of conflict, as they are also pivotal in diplomatic negotiations and the enforcement of sanctions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 184, "prompt_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 399, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
