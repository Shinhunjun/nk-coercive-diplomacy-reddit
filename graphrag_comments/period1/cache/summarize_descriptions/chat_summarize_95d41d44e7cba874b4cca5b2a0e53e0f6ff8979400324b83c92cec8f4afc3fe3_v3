This deployment is aimed at countering missile threats posed by North Korea, which has been a significant concern for regional security. Additionally, the US recognizes the potential threat from China, further justifying the presence of THAAD in the region.\n\nTHAAD serves as a critical component of the US defense strategy, providing advanced capabilities to intercept and destroy short, medium, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles during their terminal phase of flight.
