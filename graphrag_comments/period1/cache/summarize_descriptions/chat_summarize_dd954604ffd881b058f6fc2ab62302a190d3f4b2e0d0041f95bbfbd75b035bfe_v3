The joint military exercises often lead to heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, prompting North Korea to issue threats and warnings in response. In a notable instance, North Korea canceled planned talks with South Korea, citing the ongoing joint military exercises as the primary reason for its withdrawal. This cancellation underscores North Korea's perception of the exercises as not merely routine military drills, but as direct provocations that undermine diplomatic efforts and escalate military tensions in the region. Overall, the relationship between North Korea and the joint military exercises conducted by the U.S. and South Korea is characterized by a cycle of provocation and response, significantly impacting inter-Korean relations and regional stability.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 361, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
