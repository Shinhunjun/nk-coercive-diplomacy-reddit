This system is fundamentally rooted in the principles of popular sovereignty, where the authority of the government is derived from the consent of the governed. In a democratic framework, the entire population typically participates in governance through elected representatives, ensuring that diverse voices and interests are represented in the political process.\n\nCentral to the functioning and sustainability of democracy are the values of free speech and a free press. These elements are considered essential for fostering an informed citizenry and enabling open discourse, which are vital for the health of democratic institutions. Free speech allows individuals to express their opinions and engage in political discussions without fear of repression, while a free press serves as a watchdog, holding those in power accountable and providing the public with necessary information to make informed decisions.\n\nIn summary, democracy is a system of governance that emphasizes the role of the people in electing their leaders and shaping their government, supported by the fundamental rights of free expression and a free media. This combination of electoral participation and civil liberties is crucial for the effective functioning and longevity of democratic societies.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 231, "prompt_tokens": 222, "total_tokens": 453, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
