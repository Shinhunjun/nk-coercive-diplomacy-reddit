Throughout Trump's presidency, the two leaders engaged in a series of high-profile summits aimed at addressing the issue of denuclearization and reducing tensions between the United States and North Korea.\n\nTheir interactions have been marked by a mix of direct communication and public threats, with Trump often asserting a good relationship with Kim despite the underlying tensions. The relationship has seen moments of aggressive posturing, particularly from Kim Jong Un, who has maintained a defiant stance regarding his nuclear ambitions.
