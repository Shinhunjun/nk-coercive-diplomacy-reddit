Both South Korea and North Korea are involved in the development and strategic consideration of SLBMs as part of their military arsenals.\n\nSouth Korea is actively developing SLBMs to bolster its defense capabilities and ensure a robust deterrent against potential threats in the region. The development of these missiles is part of South Korea's broader strategy to enhance its military readiness and respond effectively to regional security challenges.\n\nOn the other hand, North Korea is also believed to be developing SLBMs as a critical component of its strategic military capabilities. The focus on SLBMs is indicative of North Korea's efforts to strengthen its naval capabilities and enhance its deterrent posture, particularly in the context of its ongoing tensions with South Korea and other nations.\n\nOverall, SLBMs represent a significant advancement in missile technology, providing countries with the ability to launch strikes from underwater platforms, thereby complicating detection and interception efforts. This capability is often associated with nuclear deterrence, as the stealth and mobility of submarines equipped with SLBMs allow for a more secure second-strike capability in the event of a nuclear conflict.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 251, "prompt_tokens": 299, "total_tokens": 550, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
