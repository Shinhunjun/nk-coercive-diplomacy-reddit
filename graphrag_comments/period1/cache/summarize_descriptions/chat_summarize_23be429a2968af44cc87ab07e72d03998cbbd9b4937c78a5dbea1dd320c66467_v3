This proposed economic policy aims to address issues related to manufacturing and economic competition, as both countries seek to protect their domestic industries and influence global trade dynamics.\n\nIn addition to the U.S.-China scenario, the concept of a trade war has broader implications, as evidenced by China's threats to impose trade barriers against India. This indicates that trade wars can extend beyond bilateral relations and may involve multiple countries reacting to each other's economic policies. The use of tariffs and trade restrictions serves as a tool for nations to exert economic pressure and negotiate favorable terms in international trade agreements.\n\nOverall, the trade war phenomenon encapsulates the complexities of global economic interactions, where countries leverage tariffs and trade barriers to navigate competitive landscapes and safeguard their economic interests.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 182, "prompt_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 380, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
