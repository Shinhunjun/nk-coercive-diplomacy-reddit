She notably distanced the Trump administration from any proposed contacts with North Korea, suggesting that there was a lack of seriousness in the negotiations being considered. This stance highlighted her skepticism regarding the North Korean regime's intentions and the effectiveness of diplomatic engagement at that time.\n\nIn addition to her critical view of potential negotiations, Haley actively advocated for stronger measures against North Korea in response to its nuclear tests. She publicly addressed the United Nations, emphasizing the need for sanctions to hold North Korea accountable for its provocative actions. Her efforts were aimed at rallying international support to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions and to ensure that the global community remained vigilant in the face of the threats posed by the regime.\n\nOverall, Nikki Haley's approach to North Korea was characterized by a firm stance against engagement without serious commitment from the North Korean leadership, coupled with a strong advocacy for sanctions as a means to address the ongoing nuclear threat.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 209, "prompt_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 407, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
