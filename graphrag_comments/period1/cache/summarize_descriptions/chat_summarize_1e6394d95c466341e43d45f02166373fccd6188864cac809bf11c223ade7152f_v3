The Council has consistently condemned North Korea's provocative actions, which include ballistic missile launches and nuclear tests. In response to these activities, the UN Security Council has imposed a series of sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear weapons program and missile tests.\n\nThese sanctions are a direct response to North Korea's ongoing development of its nuclear capabilities and its aggressive missile testing, which have raised significant concerns among the international community. The Security Council's measures are designed not only to penalize North Korea for its actions but also to deter further military provocations and to encourage compliance with international norms regarding nuclear proliferation.\n\nIn addition to addressing military threats, the UN Security Council is also involved in discussions about the humanitarian crisis and military tensions within North Korea. This dual focus reflects the complexity of the situation, as the Council seeks to balance the need for security with the humanitarian needs of the North Korean population.\n\nThe Security Council's involvement includes ongoing discussions about potential further sanctions and interventions, should North Korea continue its defiance of international expectations. The Council's actions are aimed at maintaining international peace and security, highlighting the global concern over North Korea's nuclear ambitions and military activities. Overall, the UN Security Council remains a key player in efforts to manage the challenges posed by North Korea on the world stage.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 280, "prompt_tokens": 402, "total_tokens": 682, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
