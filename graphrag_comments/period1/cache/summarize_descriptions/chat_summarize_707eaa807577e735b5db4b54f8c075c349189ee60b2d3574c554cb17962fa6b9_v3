The development and possession of these weapons are not only a matter of military strength but also serve as a defining characteristic of North Korea itself. The nuclear weapons program is intricately linked to the nation's identity and its approach to international relations. This program reflects North Korea's desire to assert its sovereignty and deter perceived threats, particularly from the United States and its allies.
