This aspect of their military arsenal raises significant international concerns due to the implications for global security. Reports indicate that North Korea has a reputation for not only developing but also selling biological weapons, further amplifying the perceived threat they pose to other nations.\n\nSpecifically, it is reported that North Korea possesses at least 13 different types of biological weapons that can be weaponized rapidly. This capability suggests a readiness to deploy these weapons in military conflicts, which heightens the risk of their use in hostilities. The existence of a stockpile of biological weapons in North Korea is particularly alarming, as it indicates a sustained effort to maintain and potentially expand their biological warfare capabilities.\n\nOverall, North Korea's possession and potential deployment of biological weapons represent a significant threat, contributing to the ongoing tensions in international relations and raising alarms among global security experts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 184, "prompt_tokens": 278, "total_tokens": 462, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
