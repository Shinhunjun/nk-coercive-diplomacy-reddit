This strategy emphasizes a wait-and-see attitude, focusing on diplomatic engagement while anticipating a change in North Korea's behavior over time. The approach was characterized by a reluctance to engage in direct confrontation and a preference for multilateral discussions and sanctions aimed at encouraging North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, Strategic Patience was seen as a way to manage the complexities of North Korea's provocative actions without escalating tensions. The policy aimed to create a framework for dialogue and negotiation, allowing for the possibility of a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing issues surrounding North Korea's nuclear program.\n\nHowever, this approach has since been declared over by Vice President Mike Pence, indicating a shift in U.S. policy towards North Korea. The declaration suggests a move away from the previous strategy of waiting for North Korea to change its behavior, signaling a potential change in tactics that may involve more direct engagement or pressure.\n\nIn summary, Strategic Patience was a diplomatic strategy utilized by the U.S. to address the challenges posed by North Korea, focusing on engagement and a measured response to provocations. Its conclusion marks a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy regarding North Korea, reflecting the evolving dynamics of international relations in the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 270, "prompt_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 508, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
