It is designed to reflect a user's contributions and engagement, taking into account factors such as account age and activity levels. This scoring system plays a crucial role in determining a user's ability to post in specific subreddits, thereby impacting their overall experience and participation within the Reddit community.\n\nThe Karma system operates by assigning points to users based on the upvotes and downvotes their posts and comments receive. Higher Karma scores indicate a more active and positively received user, which can enhance their credibility and visibility within the platform. Conversely, users with lower Karma may face restrictions in posting or may find their submissions less likely to be well-received.\n\nOverall, Karma serves as both a motivational tool for users to engage more meaningfully with the community and a regulatory mechanism that helps maintain the quality of content shared on Reddit.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 182, "prompt_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 372, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
