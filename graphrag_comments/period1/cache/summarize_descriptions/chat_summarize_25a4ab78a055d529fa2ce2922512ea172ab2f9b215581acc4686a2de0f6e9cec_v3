These camps are typically established for political or military reasons, serving as a means to suppress dissent and control populations. A notable example of such camps can be found in North Korea, where they are used to imprison political prisoners and dissenters. The conditions within these North Korean concentration camps are particularly harsh, leading to widespread international condemnation due to the severe human rights violations that occur there. Overall, concentration camps represent a troubling aspect of state control and repression, highlighting the extreme measures taken by governments to maintain power and silence opposition.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 127, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 328, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
