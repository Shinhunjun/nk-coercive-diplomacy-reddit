The United Nations (UN) has played a crucial role in this context by monitoring the DPRK's nuclear developments and enforcing a series of sanctions aimed at curbing its weapons programs. These sanctions were implemented in response to North Korea's ongoing missile tests and its nuclear program, which have raised global security concerns. The UN's actions reflect a broader international effort to address the challenges posed by the DPRK's military ambitions and to promote stability in the region. Through these measures, the UN seeks to encourage compliance with international norms and to foster dialogue aimed at denuclearization.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 322, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
