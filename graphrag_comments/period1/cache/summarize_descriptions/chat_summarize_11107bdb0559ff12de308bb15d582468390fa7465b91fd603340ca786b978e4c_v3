During the Cold War, North Korea received substantial support from the USSR, which played a crucial role in shaping its military and political stance. This support included military supplies, training, and resources, particularly during the Korean War, when the USSR provided essential assistance to North Korean forces.\n\nThe historical ties between North Korea's nuclear program and the USSR are notable, as the latter's influence and aid were instrumental in the development of North Korea's military capabilities. The USSR's backing not only bolstered North Korea's military strength but also laid the groundwork for its ongoing nuclear ambitions. This relationship has had lasting implications, as North Korea continues to pursue its nuclear program, drawing on the legacy of support it received from the USSR during a pivotal period in its history.\n\nIn summary, the connections between North Korea and the USSR are characterized by a history of military collaboration and support, which has significantly influenced North Korea's current military posture and nuclear aspirations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 240, "total_tokens": 452, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
