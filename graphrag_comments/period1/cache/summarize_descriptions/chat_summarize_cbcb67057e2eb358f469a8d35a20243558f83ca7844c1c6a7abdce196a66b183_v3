The ongoing conflict between North Korea and South Korea creates a tense security environment, with North Korea frequently threatening Seoul through potential military actions, including artillery strikes. This relationship is characterized by a history of hostility and military posturing, as North Korea's aggressive stance directly impacts the safety and security of Seoul and its residents.
