Initially, the TPP was designed to promote economic integration and cooperation among its member nations, facilitating trade by reducing tariffs and establishing common standards. However, the agreement faced significant political challenges, particularly in the United States, where former President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the TPP. This withdrawal had a notable impact on trade relations within the Asia-Pacific region, as the U.S. was a key player in the negotiations and implementation of the agreement. The TPP's goal was to create a comprehensive framework for trade that would benefit all participating countries, but the U.S. exit raised questions about the future viability and effectiveness of the partnership.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 155, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 355, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
