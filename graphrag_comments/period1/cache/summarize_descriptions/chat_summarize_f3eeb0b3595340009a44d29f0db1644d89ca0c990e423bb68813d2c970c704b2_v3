In the context of North Korea, the country has been actively pursuing the expansion of its uranium enrichment capabilities, a strategy that is critical for its nuclear weapons program. This expansion poses a considerable concern for international security, as it enhances North Korea's ability to develop and potentially deploy nuclear arms.\n\nIn contrast, South Korea is permitted to enrich uranium up to 20% under specific agreements with the United States. This limitation is part of broader non-proliferation efforts aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons while allowing South Korea to utilize nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, such as energy production. The distinction between North Korea's aggressive enrichment activities and South Korea's regulated approach highlights the complexities of nuclear policy in the region and the differing international responses to each country's nuclear ambitions. \n\nOverall, uranium enrichment remains a pivotal issue in global nuclear politics, with North Korea's advancements raising alarms about proliferation risks, while South Korea's regulated enrichment reflects a commitment to non-proliferation and responsible use of nuclear technology.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 237, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 438, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
