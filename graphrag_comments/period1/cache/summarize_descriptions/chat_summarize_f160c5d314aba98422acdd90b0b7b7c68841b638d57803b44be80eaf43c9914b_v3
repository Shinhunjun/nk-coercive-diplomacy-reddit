This concept is rooted in the understanding that the catastrophic consequences of nuclear warfare would deter nations from engaging in such conflicts, as the assured destruction of both parties serves as a powerful deterrent against the initiation of nuclear attacks. The doctrine emphasizes the balance of power and the necessity of maintaining a credible nuclear arsenal to ensure mutual deterrence, thereby preventing escalation into full-scale nuclear war. Overall, MAD reflects the grim reality of nuclear warfare, where the potential for total destruction serves as a critical factor in international relations and military strategy.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 359, "total_tokens": 509, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
