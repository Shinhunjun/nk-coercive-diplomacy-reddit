His leadership was marked by significant events, including the Gulf War, which began in 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait, prompting a military response from a coalition led by the United States. This conflict highlighted Hussein's aggressive foreign policy and his willingness to use military force to achieve his objectives.\n\nAfter years of oppressive governance, characterized by human rights abuses and suppression of dissent, Saddam Hussein was ultimately overthrown during the Iraq War, which commenced in March 2003. Following his removal from power, he was captured by U.S. forces in December 2003. In the subsequent years, he faced trial for crimes against humanity, particularly for his role in the mass killings of Iraqi Kurds and other political opponents.\n\nSaddam Hussein was executed by his own people in December 2006, marking a significant moment in Iraq's tumultuous history. His regime left a lasting impact on the region, influencing both domestic and international politics long after his death.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 222, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 415, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
