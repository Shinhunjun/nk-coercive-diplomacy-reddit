They serve as a mechanism for users to express disapproval of comments or submissions. This functionality plays a significant role in shaping user engagement and the overall civility of discussions within these platforms.\n\nWhen users downvote content, it can lead to a decrease in visibility for that content, which may discourage further participation from other users.
