This region has been a focal point of tension between the two nations, as both assert claims over various islands and maritime areas, leading to confrontations and diplomatic challenges.\n\nIn addition to these territorial issues, Vietnam is perceived as a competitor to China in the economic arena. As Vietnam continues to develop its economy, it has been able to gain advantages that are often viewed as occurring at China's expense. This economic rivalry further complicates their relationship, as both countries navigate their interests in a rapidly changing regional landscape.\n\nOverall, the interactions between China and Vietnam are marked by a blend of historical grievances, territorial disputes, and economic competition, reflecting the intricate dynamics of their bilateral relations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 341, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
