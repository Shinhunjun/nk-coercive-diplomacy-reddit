This war, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, resulted in extensive destruction across the Korean Peninsula and established a lasting state of tension and conflict, particularly with the United States, which supported South Korea during the war.\n\nThe conflict began when the DPRK invaded South Korea in June 1950, aiming to unify the peninsula under its communist regime. The United States, responding to the invasion, intervened on behalf of South Korea, leading to a protracted and brutal war characterized by fierce battles, significant loss of life, and widespread devastation. The war saw the involvement of various international forces, with the United Nations backing South Korea and China supporting the DPRK.\n\nDespite the armistice signed in 1953, which effectively ended active hostilities, the Korean War did not result in a formal peace treaty. Consequently, the Korean Peninsula remains divided along the 38th parallel, with the DPRK and South Korea existing as separate entities. This division has led to ongoing tensions and conflicts, particularly between the DPRK and the United States, which continue to influence geopolitical dynamics in the region.\n\nIn summary, the Korean War was a pivotal event involving the DPRK and South Korea, marked by significant destruction and a legacy of conflict that persists to this day, particularly in the context of U.S.-DPRK relations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 297, "prompt_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 487, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
