These orders serve as a means for the President to influence various policies, including those related to national security. They can have significant implications for how federal agencies operate and implement laws.\n\nOne notable example of an Executive Order was signed by President Donald Trump, which authorized additional sanctions against North Korea. This order specifically targeted individuals and companies associated with North Korea, reflecting the administration's approach to addressing national security concerns related to the country. Furthermore, another Executive Order signed by Trump enhanced the authorities of the Treasury Department, allowing it to more effectively target individuals connected to North Korea.\n\nOverall, Executive Orders are powerful tools that enable the President to direct federal operations and respond to pressing issues, such as national security threats, through specific and actionable measures.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 168, "prompt_tokens": 261, "total_tokens": 429, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
