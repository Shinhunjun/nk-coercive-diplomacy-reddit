This animosity primarily traces back to the Korean War, which solidified deep-seated tensions that have persisted over the decades. The U.S. has maintained a military presence in the region and has often been perceived as a threat by North Korea, contributing to an ongoing cycle of mistrust and conflict.\n\nDespite this adversarial backdrop, the U.S. is also engaged in diplomatic efforts with Korea.
