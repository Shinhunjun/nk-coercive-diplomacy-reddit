It is known for its successful tests, which have demonstrated its potential to carry nuclear warheads. The missile has been characterized as capable of reaching targets in the United States, highlighting its strategic importance in North Korea's military arsenal.\n\nThe Hwasong-14 has undergone testing to evaluate its reentry capabilities, an essential feature for ICBMs designed to deliver payloads over long distances. However, it has also been described as a \"Sub-level\" ICBM, indicating that it may not currently possess the capability to effectively deliver nuclear warheads to the continental United States. This suggests that while the missile represents a significant step forward in North Korea's missile development, there are still limitations regarding its operational readiness and effectiveness in a real-world scenario.\n\nOverall, the Hwasong-14 is a crucial component of North Korea's strategic military capabilities, reflecting the nation's ongoing efforts to enhance its defense systems and assert its position on the global stage.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 221, "prompt_tokens": 341, "total_tokens": 562, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
