Various diplomatic efforts are being pursued to address the challenges posed by North Korea's nuclear program, which includes its missile tests and the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). These diplomatic initiatives are primarily undertaken by South Korea and the United States, who aim to manage their relations with North Korea and mitigate the risks of military conflict.\n\nDiplomacy is viewed as an essential method for resolving tensions and conflicts arising from North Korea's actions. It serves as a counterpoint to military options, emphasizing dialogue and negotiation as means to address the threats posed by North Korea's nuclear capabilities. The willingness of North Korea to engage in diplomatic discussions is often influenced by its military strength, which includes its advancements in nuclear technology.\n\nThe overarching goal of these diplomatic efforts is to stabilize the region and prevent escalation into military confrontations.
