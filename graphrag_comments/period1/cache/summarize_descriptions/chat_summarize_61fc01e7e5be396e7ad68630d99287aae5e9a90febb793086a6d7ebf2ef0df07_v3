This strategy is central to North Korea's defense policy, as the nation seeks to establish a credible deterrent against perceived threats, notably from the United States. By maintaining and showcasing its nuclear capabilities, North Korea aims to dissuade adversaries from launching attacks, thereby ensuring its own security and sovereignty.\n\nThe concept of nuclear deterrence operates on the principle that the potential for devastating retaliatory action will inhibit an adversary's willingness to initiate conflict. In the context of North Korea, this strategy is particularly relevant given the country's focus on developing and enhancing its military capabilities, including its nuclear arsenal. The North Korean government views nuclear weapons as essential to its national defense, believing that their existence serves as a powerful deterrent against foreign intervention and aggression.\n\nOverall, nuclear deterrence remains a critical element of North Korea's military strategy, reflecting the broader dynamics of international relations and security concerns in a nuclear-armed world.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 211, "prompt_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 460, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
