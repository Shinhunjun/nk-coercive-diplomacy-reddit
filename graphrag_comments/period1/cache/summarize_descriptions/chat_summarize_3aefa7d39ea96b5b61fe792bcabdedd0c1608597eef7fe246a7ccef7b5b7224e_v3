His case highlighted the harsh treatment of foreigners by the North Korean regime. Warmbier was arrested while visiting the country as a tourist, accused of attempting to steal a propaganda banner from a hotel. His imprisonment drew significant international attention and concern regarding human rights abuses in North Korea.\n\nAfter enduring more than a year of captivity, Otto Warmbier was released in June 2017, following negotiations between U.S. and North Korean diplomats. Upon his return to the United States, it was revealed that he had suffered severe neurological damage during his time in detention, leading to widespread outrage and condemnation of North Korea's treatment of him. Warmbier's case became emblematic of the risks faced by foreigners in North Korea and sparked discussions about the country's human rights record and the need for diplomatic engagement to address such issues.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 189, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 388, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
