The regime's oppressive policies and lack of freedom contribute to a vulnerable population that is at risk of exploitation. Reports indicate that many North Koreans, especially women and children, are subjected to trafficking both within the country and in neighboring regions, where they may be forced into labor or sexual exploitation.\n\nThe North Korean government is implicated in various illegal activities, including human trafficking, which is often viewed as a means of maintaining control over its population and generating revenue.
