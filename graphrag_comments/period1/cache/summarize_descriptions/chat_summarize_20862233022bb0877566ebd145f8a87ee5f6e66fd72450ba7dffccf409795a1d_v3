The most notable conflict occurred in 2008 when Georgia engaged in military action against Russian peacekeepers in the separatist region of South Ossetia. This conflict marked a significant escalation in tensions between Georgia and Russia, leading to a brief war that resulted in Russia recognizing South Ossetia and another separatist region, Abkhazia, as independent states.\n\nThroughout this period, Georgia received military support from the United States, highlighting its strategic importance in the region and its alignment with Western interests. The territorial disputes over South Ossetia and Abkhazia remain unresolved, contributing to ongoing instability and geopolitical tensions in the area. Georgia's situation is emblematic of the broader struggles faced by post-Soviet states in navigating their sovereignty and territorial integrity amidst external pressures and historical grievances.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 187, "prompt_tokens": 240, "total_tokens": 427, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
