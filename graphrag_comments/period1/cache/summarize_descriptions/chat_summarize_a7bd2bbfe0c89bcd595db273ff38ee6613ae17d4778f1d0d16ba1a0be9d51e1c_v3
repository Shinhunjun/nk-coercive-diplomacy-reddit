This body plays a pivotal role in global governance, often engaging in discussions and decision-making regarding military actions and the imposition of sanctions. One notable instance of its authority was when the Security Council unanimously supported a resolution for sanctions against North Korea, highlighting its commitment to addressing threats to international stability.\n\nIn addition to its role in sanctioning nations, the Security Council is also deeply involved in discussions surrounding nuclear non-proliferation, reflecting its broader mandate to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and promote global security. Through its various resolutions and actions, the Security Council seeks to foster a safer international environment, addressing conflicts and potential threats through diplomatic and, when necessary, military means.\n\nOverall, the Security Council serves as a crucial mechanism for the international community to respond to crises and uphold the principles of peace and security as outlined in the UN Charter.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 193, "prompt_tokens": 220, "total_tokens": 413, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
