Turkey is perceived as having significant potential for growth, driven by its strategic geographical location, a young and dynamic population, and a diverse economy that includes strong sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism. This growth potential is further supported by Turkey's efforts to enhance its global trade relationships and improve its infrastructure.\n\nIn contrast, Mexico is viewed as being economically constrained. Despite being one of the largest economies in Latin America and having a wealth of natural resources, Mexico faces challenges such as political instability, security issues, and economic inequality. These factors hinder its ability to fully capitalize on its strengths and limit its growth potential compared to Turkey.\n\nOverall, while both Turkey and Mexico are recognized for their roles on the global stage, Turkey is seen as having a more favorable outlook for economic expansion, whereas Mexico grapples with various constraints that impede its progress.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 191, "prompt_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 376, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
