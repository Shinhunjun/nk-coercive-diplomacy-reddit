The principles of civil discussion emphasize respectful and constructive dialogue among participants. Personal insults, however, are deemed a violation of these principles. Such insults undermine the foundation of civil discourse by introducing hostility and disrespect into conversations.\n\nIn the context of subreddit policies, personal insults are explicitly prohibited. Engaging in personal attacks not only disrupts the flow of civil discussion but can also lead to disciplinary actions, including bans from the platform. This enforcement of rules is intended to maintain a respectful environment where users can engage in meaningful exchanges without fear of derogatory remarks.\n\nOverall, the relationship between civil discussion and personal insults highlights the importance of maintaining decorum in online interactions. By adhering to the guidelines that promote civil discourse, participants contribute to a more positive and productive community.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 177, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 353, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
