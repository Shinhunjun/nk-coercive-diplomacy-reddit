North Korea is actively developing and testing these missiles, which are believed to pose a substantial threat, particularly to the United States. The development of ICBMs is seen as a strategic move by North Korea to enhance its deterrent capabilities against perceived threats from other nations.\n\nICBMs are characterized by their ability to reach long distances, making them a critical component of North Korea's arsenal. The country is suspected of not only possessing these missiles but also of having the capability to manufacture more of them. This development is viewed with concern by the international community, as it raises the stakes in terms of regional and global security.\n\nThe ongoing testing of ICBMs by North Korea indicates its commitment to advancing its missile technology, which could potentially allow these weapons to reach the U.S. mainland. This capability is particularly alarming, as it signifies a shift in the balance of power and poses a direct challenge to U.S. national security interests.\n\nIn summary, ICBMs are a vital aspect of North Korea's military strategy, representing both a technological achievement and a significant threat due to their potential to deliver nuclear payloads over long distances. The international community continues to monitor North Korea's advancements in this area closely, as the implications of ICBM development extend beyond the Korean Peninsula, affecting global security dynamics.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 293, "prompt_tokens": 559, "total_tokens": 852, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
