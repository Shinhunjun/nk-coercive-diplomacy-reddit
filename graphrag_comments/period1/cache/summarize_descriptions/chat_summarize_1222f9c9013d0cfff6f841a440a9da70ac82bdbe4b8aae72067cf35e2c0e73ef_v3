It has been the site of all six of North Korea's nuclear bomb tests, which have raised significant international concerns regarding nuclear proliferation and regional stability. The site features a complex system of tunnels that were utilized for these tests.\n\nIn recent developments, Punggye-ri has been announced to be dismantled as part of North Korea's denuclearization process, aimed at reducing regional tensions. However, reports indicate that the site has become unstable and may be at risk of collapse following the multiple nuclear tests conducted there. This instability raises questions about the safety and viability of the site, as well as the implications for North Korea's nuclear capabilities.\n\nOverall, Punggye-ri has played a critical role in North Korea's nuclear program, serving as the primary location for its nuclear tests, while also becoming a focal point in discussions about denuclearization and international security.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 190, "prompt_tokens": 344, "total_tokens": 534, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
