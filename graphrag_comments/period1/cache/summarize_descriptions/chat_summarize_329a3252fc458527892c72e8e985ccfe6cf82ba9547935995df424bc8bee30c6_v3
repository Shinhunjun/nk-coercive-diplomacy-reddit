He frequently interacted with various media outlets, using them as a platform to communicate his policies and viewpoints. However, this interaction was marked by significant criticism directed at the media, which Trump accused of biased and unfair coverage. His confrontational stance towards journalists and news organizations shaped public perception and influenced political discourse during his time in office.\n\nTrump's criticisms of the media were not limited to specific instances; they were a consistent theme of his presidency.
