This phenomenon raises significant concerns regarding its environmental and health impacts. Following a nuclear blast, residual radioactive material is propelled into the upper atmosphere, where it can spread over vast areas. The fallout can contaminate air, water, and soil, posing serious risks to human health and the ecosystem. The implications of fallout are critical, as it can lead to long-term exposure to radiation, which is associated with various health issues, including cancer and other radiation-related illnesses. Overall, fallout represents a significant hazard resulting from nuclear detonations, necessitating careful monitoring and management to mitigate its effects on both the environment and public health.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 334, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
