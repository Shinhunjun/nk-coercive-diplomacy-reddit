This concept serves as a deterrent against nuclear war, as it ensures that any aggressive action involving nuclear weapons would result in catastrophic consequences for all parties involved. The underlying principle of MAD is that the threat of mutual destruction prevents nations from engaging in nuclear conflict, as the repercussions would be devastating and indiscriminate. By establishing a balance of power through the assurance of mutual destruction, MAD aims to maintain stability and discourage the initiation of nuclear warfare.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 135, "prompt_tokens": 346, "total_tokens": 481, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
