His rule was characterized by authoritarian governance and controversial policies, which included the use of military force against dissent and a significant focus on maintaining his grip on power amidst widespread civil unrest. Gaddafi's leadership was marked by a complex relationship with international politics, particularly regarding his nuclear weapons program. \n\nIn a notable shift, Gaddafi abandoned his nuclear ambitions, a decision that has since been referenced in discussions about the consequences of denuclearization, particularly in the context of U.S. foreign policy and negotiations with North Korea. His fate serves as a cautionary tale in these discussions, illustrating the potential repercussions of relinquishing nuclear capabilities. \n\nGaddafi's downfall was precipitated by the Libyan Civil War, during which he faced significant opposition from both the Libyan populace and international forces. Ultimately, he was executed by his own people, marking a dramatic end to his long and controversial rule. His legacy remains a subject of debate, reflecting the complexities of his leadership and the broader implications of his policies on Libya and international relations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 239, "prompt_tokens": 386, "total_tokens": 625, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
