It is particularly noted in the context of threats made by North Korea, highlighting its potential use as a chemical weapon. VX is known for causing severe physiological reactions in humans, including uncontrollable muscle contractions and respiratory failure, which can lead to death within minutes of exposure.\n\nThe notoriety of VX was further amplified by its use in the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. This incident underscored the dangerous capabilities of VX as a tool for targeted killings and raised international concerns regarding the proliferation of chemical weapons.\n\nOverall, VX represents a significant threat not only due to its extreme toxicity but also because of its implications in international security and the potential for its use in acts of violence and terrorism.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 175, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 375, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
