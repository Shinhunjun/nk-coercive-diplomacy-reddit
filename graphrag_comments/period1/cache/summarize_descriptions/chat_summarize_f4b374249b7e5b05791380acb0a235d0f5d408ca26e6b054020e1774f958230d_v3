This declaration reflects North Korea's ongoing strategy to assert its power and influence on the global stage, particularly in the context of its contentious relationship with the United States.\n\nIn the same forum, the speech also referenced Donald Trump's address, during which he issued a stark warning to North Korea, threatening to \"totally destroy\" the nation if provoked.

The juxtaposition of North Korea's nuclear ambitions and Trump's aggressive rhetoric illustrates the heightened volatility in the region and the challenges facing diplomatic efforts aimed at de-escalation.\n\nOverall, the UN speech encapsulated the complex dynamics of international relations involving North Korea, characterized by a blend of defiance and the strategic use of nuclear capabilities in the face of external threats.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 199, "prompt_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 393, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
