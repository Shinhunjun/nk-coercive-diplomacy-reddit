Its primary purpose is not to create a large explosion but to spread radioactive contamination over a targeted area. This makes it a significant concern in discussions about potential threats, particularly in regions where security and safety are paramount. The use of a dirty bomb is intended to instill fear and disrupt normal life by contaminating the environment, rather than causing extensive physical destruction. The implications of such a device highlight the importance of preparedness and response strategies in the face of potential threats involving radioactive materials.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 222, "total_tokens": 334, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
