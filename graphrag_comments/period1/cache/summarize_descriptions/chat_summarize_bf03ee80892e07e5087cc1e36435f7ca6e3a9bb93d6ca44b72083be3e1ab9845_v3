US jets are actively deployed as part of military operations designed to deter the aggressive actions of North Korea. This deployment reflects the United States' commitment to maintaining regional stability and countering potential threats posed by North Korea.\n\nIn recent developments, US jets have been reported dropping bombs near North Korea's border, an action that has significantly escalated military tensions in the region. This provocative maneuver is likely to elicit a strong response from North Korea, which has historically reacted defensively to perceived threats and military provocations from the United States and its allies.\n\nThe ongoing military activities involving US jets underscore the fragile security dynamics on the Korean Peninsula, where North Korea's aggressive posturing and the United States' military readiness continue to create a volatile environment. The interplay between these two entities highlights the complexities of international relations in the region, as both sides navigate their respective security concerns and strategic objectives.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 195, "prompt_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 385, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
