These weapons are characterized by their significant destructive capabilities and pose a considerable threat to global security. The discussion surrounding WMDs is central to international security dialogues, particularly due to their potential for large-scale destruction and loss of life.\n\nWMDs have been a focal point in various geopolitical contexts, notably in relation to North Korea, which is accused of pursuing and developing these types of weapons. The international community remains concerned about North Korea's military capabilities, particularly regarding its suspected possession of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. This concern is compounded by the potential for these weapons to destabilize regional and global security.\n\nThe issue of WMDs has also been pivotal in justifying military actions, such as the Iraq War, where the presence of such weapons was cited as a primary reason for intervention. The narrative surrounding WMDs often emphasizes their capacity to cause significant harm, making them a contentious topic in international relations and security policy.\n\nIn summary, Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) are a critical element of modern military strategy and international security discussions, encompassing nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons that can lead to catastrophic consequences if utilized. Their implications extend beyond mere military capabilities, influencing diplomatic relations and justifications for military interventions across the globe.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 274, "prompt_tokens": 448, "total_tokens": 722, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
