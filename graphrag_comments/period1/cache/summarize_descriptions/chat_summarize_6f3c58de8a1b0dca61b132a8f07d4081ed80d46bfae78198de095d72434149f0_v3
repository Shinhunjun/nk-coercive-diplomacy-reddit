The country has actively developed and tested a variety of missiles, which are integral to its military arsenal. These missile capabilities are often highlighted in discussions regarding North Korea's military posture and international relations.\n\nThe development of missiles by North Korea is not only aimed at enhancing its military strength but also serves as a tool for demonstrating military aggression, particularly through missile launches directed towards Japan. Such actions have escalated tensions in the region and are viewed as provocative by neighboring countries and the international community.\n\nNorth Korea is focused on advancing its missile technology, with ongoing efforts to create missiles that can reach greater distances. This capability is a key aspect of its military strategy, as it enhances North Korea's ability to project power and poses a significant threat to regional security, especially for South Korea and Japan. The missile program is a central issue in diplomatic negotiations with the United States, as North Korea's missile launches and advancements are often seen as obstacles to achieving peace and stability in the region.\n\nOverall, North Korea's missile capabilities are a major concern for global security, influencing both military strategy and diplomatic relations in East Asia.
