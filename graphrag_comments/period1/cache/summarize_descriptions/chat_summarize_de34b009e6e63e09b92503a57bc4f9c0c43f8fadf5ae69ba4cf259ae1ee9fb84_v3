However, this self-portrayal is frequently challenged by the realities of its foreign policy decisions, which can contradict its stated commitment to human rights. Critics argue that the U.S. often prioritizes strategic interests over human rights considerations, leading to inconsistencies in its approach.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. faces significant scrutiny regarding its own human rights practices, particularly concerning its detention facilities. These facilities have been the subject of international criticism, with concerns raised about the treatment of detainees and the conditions under which they are held. This scrutiny highlights a complex relationship between the U.S.'s advocacy for human rights abroad and its domestic practices, suggesting a gap between its ideals and actions.\n\nIn summary, while the U.S. asserts itself as a leader in the promotion of human rights, its foreign policy and domestic practices often reveal contradictions that invite critical examination and debate in international discussions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 211, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 410, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
