The nation has actively pursued various forms of WMDs, particularly focusing on nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. This pursuit has raised significant concerns regarding regional and global security, as North Korea's advancements in these areas are perceived as a direct threat to stability both in its immediate vicinity and beyond.\n\nThe development of nuclear weapons by North Korea has been a focal point of international attention, highlighting the strong association between the country and its WMD programs. The possession of such destructive capabilities not only endangers neighboring countries but also poses a broader threat to global security. As North Korea continues to enhance its military capabilities through the development of WMDs, the implications for international relations and peacekeeping efforts remain profound.\n\nIn summary, North Korea's commitment to advancing its WMD arsenal, particularly nuclear weapons, underscores a significant and ongoing challenge to both regional and global security frameworks.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 205, "prompt_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 462, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
