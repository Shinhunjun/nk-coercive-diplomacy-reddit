The discussions surrounding North Korea's military capabilities often highlight the possibility of the country developing or utilizing a dirty bomb, which combines conventional explosives with radioactive materials. This capability poses a unique threat, as it could lead to widespread contamination and panic, further destabilizing an already tense geopolitical landscape.\n\nThe international community remains vigilant regarding North Korea's advancements in weaponry, with dirty bombs being a focal point in these discussions.
