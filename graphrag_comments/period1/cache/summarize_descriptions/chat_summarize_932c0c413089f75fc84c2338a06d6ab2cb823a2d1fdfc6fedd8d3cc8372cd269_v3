These vessels play a crucial role in naval warfare and military operations, providing a platform for air power that can be projected far from a nation's shores. \n\nIn the context of international relations, aircraft carriers can be significant assets in military negotiations and strategic posturing. For instance, they may be involved in military negotiations between the United States and North Korea, serving as a symbol of military strength and readiness.\n\nAdditionally, the aircraft carrier has been a focal point of military cooperation between nations. Notably, Russia has provided an aircraft carrier to China, although this particular vessel is not currently operational. This transfer highlights the strategic partnerships and military collaborations that can exist between countries, as well as the complexities involved in maintaining and operating such advanced naval technology.\n\nOverall, aircraft carriers are pivotal in modern naval strategy, serving both as instruments of power projection and as tools for diplomatic engagement in international affairs.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 202, "prompt_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 408, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
