This conflict was sparked when Georgia launched an attack on Russian peacekeepers stationed in South Ossetia, which escalated tensions between the two nations. In response to Georgia's actions, Russia intervened militarily, leading to a rapid escalation of hostilities.\n\nThe conflict resulted in Russia's military actions that included the annexation of territories, further complicating the geopolitical landscape in the region. The war not only altered the status of South Ossetia but also heightened ongoing tensions between Georgia and Russia, which have persisted in the years following the conflict. The situation remains a critical point of contention in the relations between the two countries, with lasting implications for regional stability and international diplomacy.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 368, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
