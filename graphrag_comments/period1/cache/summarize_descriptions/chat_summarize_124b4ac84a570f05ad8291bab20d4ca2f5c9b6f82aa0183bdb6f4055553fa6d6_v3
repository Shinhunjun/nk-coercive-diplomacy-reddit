Bush to characterize a group of nations that he accused of supporting terrorism and pursuing weapons of mass destruction. This designation primarily included Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. The phrase was introduced in Bush's State of the Union address in January 2002, during a time when the U.S. was grappling with the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and was focused on national security and foreign policy.\n\nThe concept of the \"Axis of Evil\" reflects a broader U.S. government policy aimed at identifying and addressing perceived threats to national and global security. The countries labeled as part of this axis were viewed as hostile to American interests and values, with specific concerns regarding their potential to develop nuclear capabilities and their support for terrorist organizations. North Korea and Iran, in particular, were highlighted for their nuclear ambitions and regional destabilization efforts.\n\nIn summary, the \"Axis of Evil\" encapsulates a significant aspect of U.S. foreign policy in the early 2000s, representing a strategic framework through which the Bush administration sought to confront and counteract the actions of these nations deemed as threats to international peace and security.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 238, "prompt_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 452, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
