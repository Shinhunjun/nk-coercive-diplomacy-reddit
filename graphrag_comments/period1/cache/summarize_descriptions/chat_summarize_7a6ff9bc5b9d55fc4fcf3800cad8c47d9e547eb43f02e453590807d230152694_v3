This period was marked by significant political repression and human rights violations. In an effort to strengthen national unity and garner support for its military regime, Argentina initiated the Falklands War by invading the Falkland Islands. This conflict, which occurred in 1982, was a pivotal moment in Argentina's history, reflecting the tensions between Argentina and the United Kingdom over the sovereignty of the islands. The war ultimately ended in defeat for Argentina, but it remains a significant event in the nation's narrative, influencing its political landscape and national identity.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 141, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 343, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
