These sanctions were enacted in response to North Korea's nuclear tests, with the primary aim of curbing the country's nuclear program. The restrictions specifically focus on limiting North Korea's ability to export coal, which is a significant source of revenue for the regime. Despite these sanctions, there have been instances of violations, notably involving coal shipments to South Korea and Japan. Overall, U.N. sanctions represent a concerted effort by the international community to pressure North Korea into compliance with global non-proliferation norms.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 375, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
