It is known for its advanced military technology and is estimated to possess a nuclear arsenal of over 40 weapons, although it maintains a policy of ambiguity regarding its nuclear capabilities, often described as a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach. This has led to Israel being viewed as an aggressive nuclear state, comparable to North Korea in terms of power projection.\n\nThe country has a tumultuous relationship with both the United States and Iran, which significantly influences U.S. foreign policy in the region. Israel receives substantial foreign aid from the U.S., underscoring its reliance on American support for its military strength. The dynamics of this relationship are often discussed in the context of Israel's military actions and its involvement in various conflicts, including its historical military operations against Arab nations and groups such as Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael's capital, Jerusalem, is a focal point of international disputes, further complicating its political situation. The country has been involved in numerous military conflicts, including the notable 2006 conflict with Hezbollah, which highlighted the impact of rocket strikes on civilian areas. Additionally, Israel's military actions have sometimes been associated with accusations of false flag operations, contributing to its contentious reputation in international discussions.\n\nIn terms of military technology, Israel has established arms agreements with various nations, including Vietnam, and is often mentioned in discussions about military strategies and regional security. Its military capabilities are frequently compared to those of other nations, particularly in the context of nuclear threats and the proliferation of weapons to hostile groups.\n\nOverall, Israel is a nation deeply intertwined in ongoing geopolitical discussions, marked by its military prowess, complex relationships with neighboring countries, and significant influence on U.S. foreign policy, particularly regarding nuclear threats and regional stability.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 354, "prompt_tokens": 711, "total_tokens": 1065, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
