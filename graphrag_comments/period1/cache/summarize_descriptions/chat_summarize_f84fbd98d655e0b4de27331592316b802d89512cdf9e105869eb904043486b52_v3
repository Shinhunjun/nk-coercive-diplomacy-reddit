These exercises are designed to enhance the readiness and interoperability of the two nations' armed forces. However, they have been a source of significant tension in the region, particularly with North Korea, which perceives these drills as provocative actions and a rehearsal for invasion. North Korea's strong opposition to these exercises stems from its view that they threaten its national security and sovereignty. As a result, the joint military exercises often provoke sharp reactions from North Korea, leading to heightened military rhetoric and sometimes escalated military posturing in the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 121, "prompt_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 319, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
