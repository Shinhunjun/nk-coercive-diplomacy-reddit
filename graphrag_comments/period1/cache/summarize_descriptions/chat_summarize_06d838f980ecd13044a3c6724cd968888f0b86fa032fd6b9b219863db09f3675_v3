This involvement has had profound implications for regional stability in South Asia. The U.S. military operations in Afghanistan were primarily initiated in response to the events of September 11, 2001, leading to the War on Terror. \n\nThe USA's military presence in Afghanistan aimed to dismantle terrorist networks, particularly those associated with Al-Qaeda, and to remove the Taliban regime that had provided them sanctuary. Over the years, this intervention has evolved, encompassing various military and humanitarian efforts aimed at stabilizing the country and promoting democratic governance. \n\nThe impact of the U.S. military operations has been multifaceted, influencing not only Afghanistan's internal dynamics but also the broader geopolitical landscape of the region. The USA's actions have sparked debates regarding their effectiveness and the long-term consequences for both Afghanistan and its neighboring countries. \n\nIn summary, the USA's military intervention in Afghanistan has been a pivotal aspect of its foreign policy, significantly affecting regional stability and the ongoing conflict in the area.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 226, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 413, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
