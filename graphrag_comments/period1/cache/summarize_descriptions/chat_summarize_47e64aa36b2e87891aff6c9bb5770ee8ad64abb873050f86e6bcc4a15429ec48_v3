The conflict, which began in 1950, saw the U.S. intervene on behalf of South Korea in response to North Korea's invasion. This involvement led to extensive military engagement and resulted in considerable destruction across North Korea. The war ended in 1953 with an armistice, but no formal peace treaty was ever signed, leaving the two Koreas technically still at war and contributing to ongoing military tensions in the region.\n\nIn addition to its military involvement, the U.S. has been actively engaged in addressing North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Over the years, the U.S. has sought to negotiate denuclearization and prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, which remains a critical concern for regional and global security. The complexities of these diplomatic efforts are intertwined with the historical context of the Korean War, as the legacy of the conflict continues to influence U.S. policy and strategy in dealing with North Korea.\n\nOverall, the U.S. involvement in the Korean War and its subsequent efforts to manage North Korea's nuclear threat reflect a long-standing commitment to maintaining stability in East Asia and addressing the challenges posed by a militarized North Korea.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 253, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 448, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
