These provocative actions have raised significant security concerns not only for South Korea but also for the broader region. In response to the perceived threats posed by Kim Jong Un's regime, the United States and South Korea have deployed the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea. This advanced missile defense system is designed to intercept and destroy short, medium, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles during their terminal phase of flight, thereby providing a crucial layer of defense against potential attacks from North Korea. The deployment of THAAD is viewed as a necessary measure to enhance South Korea's security and deter further aggression from Kim Jong Un's government.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 160, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 355, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
