This policy prioritizes military needs above civilian requirements, shaping the political and economic landscape of the country. Under Songun, the military is afforded preferential treatment in state affairs, which influences various aspects of governance, including decision-making processes and the allocation of resources. The implementation of this policy reflects North Korea's strategic focus on maintaining a strong military presence, which is deemed essential for national security and regime stability.
