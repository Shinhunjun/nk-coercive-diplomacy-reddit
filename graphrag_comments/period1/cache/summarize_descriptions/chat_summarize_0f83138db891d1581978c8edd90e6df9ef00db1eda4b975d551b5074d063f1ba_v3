This mechanism serves as an indirect method for selecting these high-ranking officials, reflecting the framers' intent to balance the influence of populous states with less populous ones in the electoral process. The system is designed to ensure that each state has a proportional say in the election, with the number of electors from each state corresponding to its total number of Senators and Representatives in Congress.
