This zone is notable for its significant military presence, particularly the thousands of artillery sites established by North Korea. The DMZ serves as a buffer zone intended to reduce the likelihood of conflict between the two nations, which have been in a state of armistice since the Korean War ended in 1953. Despite its name, the DMZ is one of the most militarized borders in the world, characterized by extensive fortifications and military installations on both sides. The presence of North Korean artillery sites within this area underscores the ongoing tensions and the potential for military confrontation, making the Korean DMZ a focal point of geopolitical interest and security concerns in the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 350, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
