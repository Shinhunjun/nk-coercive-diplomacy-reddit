His leadership was marked by a series of controversial actions, including the use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and severe human rights abuses. Hussein's regime was characterized by a strict dictatorship that suppressed dissent and maintained power through fear and violence.\n\nDuring his time in power, Saddam Hussein played a pivotal role in the Gulf War, which began in 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait. This conflict drew international condemnation and led to a U.S.-led coalition that ultimately expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Hussein's relationship with the United States was complex; during the Cold War, he was initially supported by the U.S. as a counterbalance to Iran, but this relationship soured over time, particularly as concerns about his WMD capabilities grew.\n\nThe culmination of international tensions surrounding Hussein's regime led to the controversial U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. The invasion was justified by the U.S. government on the grounds that Iraq possessed WMD and posed a threat to global security. However, no such weapons were found, leading to widespread criticism of the invasion and discussions about U.S. foreign policy and regime change.\n\nSaddam Hussein's rule ended with his overthrow by U.S. forces, and he was later captured, tried, and executed in 2006. His execution is often referenced in discussions about the consequences of nuclear disarmament and the broader implications of military intervention in sovereign nations. Hussein's legacy remains a contentious topic, as it raises questions about the ethics of intervention, the complexities of Middle Eastern politics, and the long-term effects of regime change.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 345, "prompt_tokens": 386, "total_tokens": 731, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
