Under his regime, there has been a strong emphasis on advancing the nuclear weapons program, with Kim Jong-un overseeing both the development and testing of these weapons. He has made public statements asserting the completion and readiness of North Korea's nuclear arsenal, indicating a commitment to enhancing the country's military capabilities.\n\nThe focus on nuclear weapons serves multiple purposes for Kim Jong-un's regime. Primarily, it acts as a means of deterrence against perceived threats, particularly from the United States and its allies. By possessing a robust nuclear arsenal, North Korea aims to project power and assert its sovereignty on the global stage. The development of these weapons is not only a strategic military initiative but also a significant aspect of the regime's identity and legitimacy.\n\nOverall, Kim Jong-un's approach to nuclear weapons is integral to his leadership, reflecting a broader strategy of using military strength to secure the regime's position both domestically and internationally.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 211, "prompt_tokens": 278, "total_tokens": 489, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
