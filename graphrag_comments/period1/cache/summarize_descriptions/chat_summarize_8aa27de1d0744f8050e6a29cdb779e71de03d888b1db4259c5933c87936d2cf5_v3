This condition is particularly noted for its association with deformities in newborns, as well as various health problems experienced by civilians living in areas affected by nuclear activities. The defectors report that these health issues are a direct consequence of the radiation emitted during the tests, raising concerns about the long-term effects of such exposure on the population.
