This system is often contrasted with socialism, which emphasizes collective or governmental ownership and control of production. In capitalism, individuals and businesses have the freedom to operate and compete in the marketplace, leading to innovation and economic growth.\n\nThe impact of capitalism extends beyond mere economic transactions; it significantly influences social classes and wealth distribution. Under capitalism, wealth tends to accumulate in the hands of those who own productive resources, which can lead to disparities in income and social status. This dynamic creates distinct social classes, often characterized by varying levels of access to resources, opportunities, and power.\n\nOverall, capitalism is a complex system that fosters economic activity through private enterprise while simultaneously shaping societal structures and relationships based on wealth and class distinctions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 165, "prompt_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 348, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
