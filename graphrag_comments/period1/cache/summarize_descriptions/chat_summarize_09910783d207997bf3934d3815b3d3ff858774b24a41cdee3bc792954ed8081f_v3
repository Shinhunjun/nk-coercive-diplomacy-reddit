These actions are often perceived as threats not only to regional stability but also to international security. In response to these provocations, military responses are typically formulated by various nations, notably the United States. The U.S. and its allies closely monitor North Korea's military activities, and any significant escalation, such as missile launches, can trigger a swift military response aimed at deterring further aggression and ensuring the safety of allied nations. Thus, North Korea's military actions play a crucial role in shaping the military strategies and responses of other countries in the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 316, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
