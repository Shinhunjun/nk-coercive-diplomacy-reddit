As a pioneer in nuclear technology, the United States was the first nation to develop and deploy nuclear weapons, setting a precedent that has shaped international relations and security dynamics since World War II.\n\nIn recent years, the United States has strategically introduced nuclear weapons into the Korean Peninsula, a move that has notably influenced regional security. This deployment is part of a broader military strategy aimed at countering the threats posed by North Korea's own nuclear arsenal. The presence of U.S. nuclear weapons in the region serves as a deterrent against potential aggression from North Korea, which has been actively developing its nuclear capabilities.\n\nThe United States' approach to nuclear weapons is not only focused on deterrence but also involves a commitment to shaping global nuclear policy. Through various treaties and diplomatic efforts, the U.S. seeks to promote non-proliferation and disarmament, while simultaneously ensuring its own national security interests are protected. This duality reflects the complexities of nuclear strategy, where the U.S. must balance its role as a nuclear power with its responsibilities on the global stage.\n\nOverall, the United States' involvement with nuclear weapons has significantly influenced both regional and global security landscapes, particularly in relation to North Korea, and continues to be a critical aspect of its military and foreign policy.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 280, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 480, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
