Its primary mission is to promote peace, security, and cooperation among nations. The UN addresses a wide range of global issues, including conflict resolution and the imposition of sanctions, particularly in relation to North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea has been a significant focus of the UN's efforts to maintain international peace and security, especially due to its defiance of international norms through missile tests and nuclear program advancements. In response to these actions, the UN has implemented a series of economic sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear ambitions. These sanctions are part of broader resolutions that the UN has adopted to address the threats posed by North Korea's missile tests and nuclear activities.\n\nThe UN actively monitors and reports on North Korea's missile tests, ensuring that the international community is informed about developments that could impact regional and global security. Through its resolutions and sanctions, the UN seeks to hold North Korea accountable for its actions and to encourage compliance with international law.\n\nOverall, the United Nations plays a crucial role in fostering international dialogue and cooperation, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by North Korea's military provocations and nuclear aspirations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 240, "prompt_tokens": 363, "total_tokens": 603, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
