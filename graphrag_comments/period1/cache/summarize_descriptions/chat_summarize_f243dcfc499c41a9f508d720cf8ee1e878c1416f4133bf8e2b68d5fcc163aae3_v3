The attack primarily utilized the EternalBlue exploit, which was reportedly associated with technology developed by the CIA. This global cyber incident was attributed to North Korean hackers, specifically linked to the Lazarus Group, a notorious cybercriminal organization known for its sophisticated cyber operations.\n\nThe WannaCry ransomware rapidly spread across numerous computers worldwide, affecting hundreds of thousands of systems in over 150 countries. The attack highlighted the advanced cyber capabilities of North Korea and raised concerns about the security of critical infrastructure and personal data. By encrypting files on infected machines and demanding ransom payments in Bitcoin, WannaCry caused significant disruption to businesses, healthcare systems, and government organizations.\n\nThe incident underscored the importance of cybersecurity measures and the need for organizations to patch vulnerabilities in their systems promptly. The widespread impact of WannaCry served as a wake-up call for many regarding the potential threats posed by state-sponsored cyber activities and the necessity for robust defenses against ransomware attacks.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 206, "prompt_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 420, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
