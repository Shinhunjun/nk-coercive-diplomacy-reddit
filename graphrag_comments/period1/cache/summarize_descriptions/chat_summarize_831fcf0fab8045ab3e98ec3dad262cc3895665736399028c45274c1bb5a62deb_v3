Established to facilitate trade and investment between these three nations, NAFTA has had significant implications for their economic interactions. The agreement aims to reduce or eliminate trade barriers, thereby promoting a more integrated North American economy.\n\nIn recent years, NAFTA has been a focal point of political discourse, particularly during the administration of former President Donald Trump, who sought to renegotiate the terms of the agreement.
