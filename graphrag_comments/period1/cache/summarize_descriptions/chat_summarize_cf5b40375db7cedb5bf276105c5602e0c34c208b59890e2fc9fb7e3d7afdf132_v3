They are often the primary population affected by various threats, including missile warnings and military operations. As non-combatants, civilians are not part of the armed forces, yet their safety and lives are frequently at risk during times of war and conflict. \n\nIn military contexts, civilians are recognized as individuals who do not engage in combat but may still face significant dangers due to the actions of armed forces. Their vulnerability is heightened during military operations, where the line between combatants and non-combatants can become blurred, leading to potential harm to civilian populations. \n\nOverall, the term \"civilians\" encompasses a broad group of individuals who, despite not being involved in military activities, are deeply impacted by the consequences of warfare and national security threats. Their protection and well-being are critical considerations in both military strategy and humanitarian efforts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 189, "prompt_tokens": 220, "total_tokens": 409, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
