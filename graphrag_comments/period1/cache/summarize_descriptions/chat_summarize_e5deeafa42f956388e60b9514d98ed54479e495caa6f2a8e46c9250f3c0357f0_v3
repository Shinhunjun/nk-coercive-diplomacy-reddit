It plays a crucial role in U.S. counterterrorism policy and has been a central topic in ongoing discussions regarding human rights. Established in the wake of the September 11 attacks, Gitmo has been utilized to hold individuals captured in the context of the U.S. government's efforts to combat terrorism. \n\nThe facility has garnered significant attention and controversy over the years, particularly concerning the treatment of detainees and the legal processes surrounding their detention. Critics argue that Gitmo represents a violation of human rights, citing issues such as indefinite detention without trial and allegations of torture. Supporters, however, contend that the detention of suspected terrorists is necessary for national security and the protection of American citizens.\n\nOverall, Gitmo remains a pivotal element of U.S. counterterrorism strategy, embodying the complex interplay between security measures and human rights considerations in the post-9/11 era.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 206, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 397, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
