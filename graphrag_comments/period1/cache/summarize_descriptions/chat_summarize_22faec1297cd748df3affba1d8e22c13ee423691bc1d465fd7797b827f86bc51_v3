It was established to unite countries in their efforts to limit global warming and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement emphasizes the importance of financial commitments from developed nations to assist developing countries in their climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. Some discussions have highlighted that this financial support could extend to countries like North Korea, although the specifics of such commitments can vary.\n\nThe Paris Accord gained significant attention during the presidency of Donald Trump, who made the controversial decision to withdraw the United States from the agreement. This withdrawal sparked widespread debate and criticism, as many viewed it as a setback in the global fight against climate change. The accord itself represents a collective commitment from nations around the world to work towards sustainable environmental practices and to limit the rise in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nIn summary, the Paris Accord is a pivotal international agreement focused on combating climate change, involving financial commitments to support various countries, including potentially North Korea, and marked by significant political events such as the U.S. withdrawal under President Trump.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 244, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 437, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
