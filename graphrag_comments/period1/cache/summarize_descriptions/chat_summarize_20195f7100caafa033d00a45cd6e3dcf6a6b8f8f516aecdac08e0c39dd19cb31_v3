Trump's approach included a series of statements and negotiations that highlighted the complexities of nuclear diplomacy. His administration's rhetoric frequently involved discussions about the potential use of nuclear weapons, reflecting a broader strategy aimed at addressing perceived threats from these nations.\n\nIn the context of North Korea, Trump's negotiations were primarily centered around the country's nuclear weapons program. He sought to engage with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in an effort to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, which involved high-profile summits and direct communication. Trump's administration emphasized the importance of curbing North Korea's nuclear capabilities, framing the discussions as critical to regional and global security.\n\nAdditionally, Trump's statements regarding nuclear weapons extended to Iran, where his administration adopted a confrontational stance. The U.S. withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, which had aimed to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Trump's rhetoric often suggested a willingness to consider military options, including the use of nuclear weapons, if necessary to prevent Iran from developing nuclear capabilities.\n\nOverall, Trump's presidency was marked by a distinctive approach to nuclear weapons, characterized by a blend of negotiation, rhetoric, and a willingness to confront adversaries. His administration's policies and statements underscored the central role that nuclear weapons played in U.S. foreign policy during his tenure, particularly concerning North Korea and Iran.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 298, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 498, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
