This situation significantly impacts South Korea's defense policies, as the presence of nuclear weapons in North Korea poses a direct threat to its national security. Consequently, South Korea's military and diplomatic strategies are heavily influenced by the potential risks associated with North Korea's nuclear capabilities.\n\nIn response to these threats, South Korea is actively engaged in discussions concerning nuclear weapons and the broader issue of denuclearization with North Korea. These discussions are critical as they aim to address the security concerns stemming from North Korea's nuclear ambitions and to seek a peaceful resolution to the tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The South Korean government recognizes that the stability of the region is contingent upon effectively managing the challenges posed by North Korea's nuclear arsenal.\n\nOverall, South Korea's approach to its security and defense is intricately linked to the developments in North Korea's nuclear weapons program, shaping its policies and strategies in a complex geopolitical landscape.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 199, "prompt_tokens": 230, "total_tokens": 429, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
