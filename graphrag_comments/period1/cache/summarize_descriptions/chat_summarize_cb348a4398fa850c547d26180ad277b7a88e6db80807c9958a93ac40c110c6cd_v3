This aggressive act by Iraq prompted a swift and robust response from an international coalition led by the United States. The coalition's primary objective was to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait, which had been occupied since the invasion.\n\nThe conflict is characterized by its rapid military operations and the extensive use of advanced technology, including precision bombing and a large-scale ground offensive. The coalition forces, comprising troops from various countries, successfully liberated Kuwait in early 1991, marking a decisive victory against Iraq. The Gulf War not only highlighted the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East but also set the stage for future conflicts in the region.\n\nOverall, the Gulf War stands as a pivotal moment in modern military history, showcasing the effectiveness of coalition warfare and the international community's response to aggression.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 179, "prompt_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 422, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
