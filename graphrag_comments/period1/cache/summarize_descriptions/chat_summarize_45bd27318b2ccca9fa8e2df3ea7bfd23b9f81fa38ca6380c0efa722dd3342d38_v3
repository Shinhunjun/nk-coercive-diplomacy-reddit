This era was marked by the threat of nuclear conflict, military build-up, and ideological rivalry, fundamentally shaping international relations and military strategies. The Cold War influenced not only the superpowers involved but also had far-reaching effects on global politics, including the foreign policies of various nations such as India and Pakistan.\n\nDuring this period, the Soviet Union supported North Korea, which played a crucial role in the Korean conflict and contributed to the division of Korea into North and South. The Cold War's impact extended to military strategies and alliances, as both superpowers engaged in a series of defense projects and negotiations that would define their respective approaches to international relations. The threat of nuclear war loomed large, with nuclear weapons becoming central to military strategy and international diplomacy.\n\nThe Cold War also influenced the actions of other countries, including China, and continues to resonate in contemporary discussions about nuclear policies and treaties. The geopolitical dynamics established during the Cold War have shaped current military strategies and international relations, particularly in the context of North Korea's ongoing developments.\n\nOverall, the Cold War was a defining period that not only influenced the immediate geopolitical landscape but also laid the groundwork for many of the military and diplomatic challenges faced in the present day. Its legacy is evident in the ongoing discussions about nuclear deterrence and the strategic calculations of nations around the world.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 288, "prompt_tokens": 738, "total_tokens": 1026, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
