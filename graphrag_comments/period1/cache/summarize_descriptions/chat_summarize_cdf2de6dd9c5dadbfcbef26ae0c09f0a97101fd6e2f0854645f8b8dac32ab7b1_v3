This goal is primarily pursued by South Korea, driven by a desire for unity and peace on the Korean Peninsula. The concept of reunification is deeply rooted in the political and social movements that have emerged over the years, reflecting the aspirations of many Koreans for a harmonious future.\n\nHowever, the path to reunification is complicated by various geopolitical factors, particularly the nuclear capabilities of North Korea.
