Established in 1921, the CCP has maintained a central role in shaping the political landscape of China, implementing policies that reflect its ideological foundations and objectives. The party is often criticized for its governance style, which is marked by limited political freedoms, suppression of dissent, and strict control over information and media. This authoritarian approach has led to significant scrutiny from international observers and human rights organizations, who highlight concerns regarding civil liberties and human rights violations under the party's rule. Despite these criticisms, the CCP continues to play a dominant role in Chinese society, steering the nation’s development and international relations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 149, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 341, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
