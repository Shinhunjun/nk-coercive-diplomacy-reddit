This phenomenon is particularly exemplified by the ongoing economic conflict between the United States and China. In this specific trade war, both nations have implemented a series of tariffs and trade barriers that have significant repercussions not only for their own economies but also for global markets at large. The imposition of these tariffs is often a response to perceived unfair trade practices, leading to a cycle of retaliation that exacerbates the economic discord. As a result, the trade war has become a critical issue in international relations and economic policy, influencing trade dynamics and economic strategies worldwide.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 329, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
