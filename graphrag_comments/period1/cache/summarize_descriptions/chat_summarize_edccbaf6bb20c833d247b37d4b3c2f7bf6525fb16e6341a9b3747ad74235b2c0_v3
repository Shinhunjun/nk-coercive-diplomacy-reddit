Security Council, particularly concerning its nuclear weapons program. In response to North Korea's ongoing missile tests and nuclear activities, the U.N. Security Council has implemented a series of sanctions aimed at curbing its military ambitions. These sanctions have included blacklisting North Korean ships that attempt to circumvent these restrictions, highlighting the international community's efforts to enforce compliance.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council's measures against North Korea are multifaceted, addressing not only the direct threats posed by its nuclear tests but also the broader implications for international security and stability. The sanctions have significantly impacted North Korea's financial dealings, restricting its ability to engage in trade and access international markets. The Council frequently convenes to discuss and address the evolving situation regarding North Korea's nuclear program and its implications for global peace and security.\n\nOverall, the relationship between North Korea and the U.N. Security Council is characterized by ongoing tensions, as North Korea continues to pursue its nuclear ambitions despite international efforts to impose restrictions and promote disarmament.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 215, "prompt_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 503, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
