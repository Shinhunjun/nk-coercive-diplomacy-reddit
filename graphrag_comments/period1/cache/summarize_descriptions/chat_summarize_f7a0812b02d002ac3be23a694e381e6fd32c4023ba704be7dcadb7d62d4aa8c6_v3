Established to curb the spread of nuclear arms, the NPT serves as a framework for global disarmament and aims to foster cooperation in the field of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. \n\nOne of the key objectives of the NPT is to prevent countries from developing nuclear weapons, thereby contributing to international security and stability. The treaty establishes a distinction between nuclear-armed states and non-nuclear-armed states, with the former being those that had tested nuclear weapons before the treaty's inception in 1968. The NPT encourages nuclear-armed states to pursue disarmament and non-nuclear states to refrain from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\nThe treaty has faced challenges, particularly with nations like North Korea, which has been accused of violating its commitments under the NPT. North Korea's actions have raised significant concerns regarding the effectiveness of the treaty in preventing nuclear proliferation and maintaining global peace. The ongoing tensions surrounding North Korea's nuclear program highlight the complexities and difficulties in enforcing the principles of the NPT.\n\nOverall, the Non-Proliferation Treaty remains a cornerstone of international efforts to manage nuclear risks and promote the peaceful use of nuclear technology, despite the challenges posed by non-compliance from certain states.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 271, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 472, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
