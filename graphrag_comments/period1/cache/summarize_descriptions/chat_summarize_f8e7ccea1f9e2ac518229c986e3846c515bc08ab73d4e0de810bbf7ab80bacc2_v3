The island is within range of North Korean missile capabilities, which positions it as a potential target in the event of military conflict. North Korea has explicitly threatened Guam, underscoring its strategic military interest in the region. This situation highlights the geopolitical significance of Guam, as it serves as a critical base for U.S. military operations in the Pacific and a key point of concern regarding North Korea's aggressive posturing and missile development programs.
