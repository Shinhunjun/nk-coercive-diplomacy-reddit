The country's ongoing development of advanced military technologies has led to speculation about its capabilities and intentions in this area. Analysts suggest that the possibility of North Korea employing EMP weapons could pose a serious threat to regional security, as such weapons can disrupt or disable electronic systems, potentially crippling critical infrastructure and military operations of targeted nations. This potential use of EMP technology is viewed as a strategic consideration in North Korea's broader military doctrine, which aims to enhance its deterrence capabilities and assert its influence in the region. As a result, the prospect of North Korea utilizing EMP weapons remains a significant concern for neighboring countries and the international community, highlighting the need for vigilance and preparedness in addressing the evolving security landscape in East Asia.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 164, "prompt_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 343, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
