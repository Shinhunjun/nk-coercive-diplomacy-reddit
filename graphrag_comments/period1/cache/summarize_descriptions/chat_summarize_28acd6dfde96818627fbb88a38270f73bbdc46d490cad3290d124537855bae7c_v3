This program has been a focal point of international concern and condemnation, as it raises serious implications for both regional and global security. The advancements in North Korea's missile technology, particularly in the realm of nuclear missiles, have heightened tensions not only in the Korean Peninsula but also with the United States and other nations.\n\nThe missile program encompasses a range of missile systems, which North Korea has actively tested over the years. These tests have often been met with widespread criticism from the international community, as they are perceived as provocative actions that threaten peace and stability in the region. The development of nuclear-capable missiles is particularly alarming, as it poses a direct challenge to international norms regarding nuclear proliferation and raises fears of potential military confrontations.\n\nOverall, North Korea's missile program is a central issue in the ongoing conflict with the United States and has become a critical factor in diplomatic relations and security strategies in East Asia. The program's implications extend beyond North Korea, affecting global security dynamics and prompting discussions about defense measures and diplomatic efforts to mitigate the risks associated with North Korea's missile capabilities.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 241, "prompt_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 484, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
