North Korea possesses a substantial arsenal of artillery, which has been reported to have been moved closer to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) with the potential objective of targeting Seoul. This positioning of artillery serves as a significant aspect of North Korea's military strategy and acts as a deterrent against potential attacks.\n\nThe large number of artillery pieces in North Korea's inventory poses a considerable threat to South Korea, especially to its capital, Seoul.
