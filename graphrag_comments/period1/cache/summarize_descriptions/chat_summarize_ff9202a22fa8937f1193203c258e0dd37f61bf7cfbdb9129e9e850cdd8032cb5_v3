This ideology has been particularly prominent in Ukraine, where it has played a significant role in shaping political dynamics and societal divisions. The rise of nationalism in Ukraine has been marked by a strong emphasis on national identity, which has sometimes led to conflicts with neighboring countries and internal groups.\n\nIn addition to Ukraine, nationalism has also been on the rise in other parts of the world, notably in the United States and Japan. In the U.S., nationalist sentiments have influenced political discourse and policy, contributing to debates over immigration, trade, and international relations. Similarly, in Japan, nationalism has affected regional stability, as it intertwines with historical grievances and territorial disputes.\n\nOverall, nationalism serves as a powerful force that can unify a nation around shared values and identity, but it can also lead to exclusionary practices and conflicts both within and between nations. The increasing prominence of nationalism in various countries highlights its complex role in contemporary global politics.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 413, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
