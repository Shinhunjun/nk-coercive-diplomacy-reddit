This concept is particularly relevant in the context of geopolitical discussions, such as Russia's involvement in Syria and Eastern Europe, where insurgent groups may challenge established authorities. Insurgencies typically manifest as rebellions against recognized governmental authority and often involve armed conflict, making them a significant factor in military engagements, including those undertaken by the United States in various countries.\n\nThe nature of an insurgency encompasses a range of tactics and strategies aimed at destabilizing the existing government, which can include guerrilla warfare, propaganda, and the mobilization of civilian support. Insurgencies can arise from various motivations, including political, social, or economic grievances, and they often exploit weaknesses within the state to gain traction and legitimacy among the populace.\n\nIn summary, insurgencies represent a complex phenomenon characterized by their goal of challenging and ultimately overthrowing established governments through a combination of subversion and armed conflict, with notable implications for international relations and military strategy.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 206, "prompt_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 417, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
