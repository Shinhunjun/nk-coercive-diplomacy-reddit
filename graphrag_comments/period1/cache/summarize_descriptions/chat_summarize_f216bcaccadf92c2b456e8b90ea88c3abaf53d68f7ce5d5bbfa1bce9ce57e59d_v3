His remarks indicate a willingness to engage in discussions about reducing North Korea's nuclear arsenal. However, KJU's commitment to denuclearization is explicitly contingent upon the removal of the United States military presence in the region. This condition highlights the complex interplay between North Korea's security concerns and its willingness to negotiate on nuclear issues. Thus, while there appears to be an openness to denuclearization, it is intricately linked to broader geopolitical dynamics, particularly the presence of U.S. forces in East Asia.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 317, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
