This period was marked by heightened tensions, as Trump's policies and rhetoric often criticized Pakistan's role in regional security and counterterrorism efforts. \n\nOne notable aspect of this strained relationship was the increase in drone strikes conducted by the U.S. in Pakistan.

The escalation of drone operations under Trump's leadership reflected a shift in U.S. military strategy, emphasizing direct action against perceived threats.\n\nOverall, Trump's approach to Pakistan was characterized by a combination of criticism and military action, which complicated the already complex dynamics of U.S.-Pakistan relations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 163, "prompt_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 337, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
