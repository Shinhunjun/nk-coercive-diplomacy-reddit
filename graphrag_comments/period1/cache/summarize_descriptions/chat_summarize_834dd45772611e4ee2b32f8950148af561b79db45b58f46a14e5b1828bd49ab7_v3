The relationship between the two nations has been characterized by Russia's military support for the Assad regime, which has been crucial in bolstering the government's position against various opposition groups. This support has included the provision of military equipment, airstrikes, and strategic advice, which have collectively helped the Syrian government maintain control over significant portions of the country.\n\nIn addition to military assistance, Russia has been a pivotal player in the broader Syrian conflict, actively engaging in diplomatic efforts to shape the outcome of the war.
