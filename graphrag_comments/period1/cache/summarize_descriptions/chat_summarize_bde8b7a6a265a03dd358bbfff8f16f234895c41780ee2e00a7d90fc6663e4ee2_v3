This designation is often employed in a satirical or critical manner, reflecting the pervasive cult of personality that surrounds him. The regime promotes Kim Jong-un as a heroic figure, despite the stark contrast between this portrayal and the reality faced by the North Korean populace, who endure significant hardships under his leadership.\n\nThe use of \"Glorious Leader\" underscores the propaganda efforts of the North Korean government, which seeks to elevate Kim Jong-un's image to that of an infallible and revered leader. This characterization is part of a broader narrative that aims to instill loyalty and admiration among the citizens, even as they grapple with economic difficulties and human rights abuses. The term encapsulates the contradictions inherent in the regime's messaging, where the glorification of the leader stands in stark opposition to the lived experiences of the North Korean people.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 233, "total_tokens": 427, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
