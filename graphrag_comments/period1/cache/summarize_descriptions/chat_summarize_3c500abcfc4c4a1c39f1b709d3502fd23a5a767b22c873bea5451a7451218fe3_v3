This involvement has established a direct relationship between the US and Iraq, characterized by a series of military actions that have had profound implications for both nations.\n\nThe US military interventions in Iraq began notably with the invasion in 2003, which was justified by the US government on the grounds of eliminating weapons of mass destruction and combating terrorism. However, this invasion led to significant instability within Iraq, contributing to a power vacuum that facilitated the emergence of extremist groups, most notably ISIS. The aftermath of the invasion saw widespread conflict, resulting in substantial casualties and a humanitarian crisis that affected millions of Iraqis.\n\nThe US's military presence in Iraq has been marked by ongoing operations aimed at stabilizing the region and combating insurgency. These operations have included not only combat missions but also efforts to train and equip Iraqi security forces. Despite these efforts, the legacy of US military involvement in Iraq remains contentious, with debates surrounding the effectiveness and consequences of such interventions continuing to this day.\n\nOverall, the US's military history in Iraq is characterized by a series of interventions that have shaped the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East, leading to both immediate and long-term ramifications for Iraq and its people.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 265, "prompt_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 481, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
