It is created through the process of nuclear fission and is characterized by its instability, which contributes to its radioactive properties. \n\nIn the context of nuclear weapons, Cobalt-60 has been referenced in discussions surrounding North Korea's nuclear capabilities, particularly in relation to the potential use of dirty bombs. A dirty bomb, or radiological dispersal device, utilizes conventional explosives to spread radioactive material, and Cobalt-60's properties make it a candidate for such applications due to its ability to emit harmful radiation.\n\nBeyond its implications in military contexts, Cobalt-60 is also widely utilized in medical and industrial applications. In the medical field, it serves as a radioactive source for cancer treatment, particularly in radiation therapy, where it helps to target and destroy malignant cells. In industrial settings, Cobalt-60 is employed for various purposes, including sterilization of medical equipment and food irradiation, which helps to eliminate pathogens and extend shelf life.\n\nOverall, Cobalt-60 is a versatile isotope with significant implications in both defense and civilian sectors, highlighting the complex nature of its use and the importance of managing its applications responsibly.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 247, "prompt_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 458, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
