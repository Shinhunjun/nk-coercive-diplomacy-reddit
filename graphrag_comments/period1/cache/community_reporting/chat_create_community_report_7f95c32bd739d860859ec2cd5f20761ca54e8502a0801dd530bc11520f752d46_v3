Historically, Russia has provided military and economic assistance to North Korea, which has been crucial for the latter's defense capabilities. This relationship has been characterized by Russia's involvement in North Korea's missile and nuclear technology development, raising concerns about regional security and the potential for military escalation. The geographical proximity of the two nations facilitates this partnership, allowing for direct military and technological exchanges that significantly impact the geopolitical landscape of Northeast Asia.

While Russia has publicly condemned North Korea's missile tests, it has also been accused of providing support that enables North Korea to evade international sanctions. This duality complicates Russia's position in international negotiations and highlights its strategic interest in maintaining a buffer state against U.S. influence in the region. The implications of this relationship extend beyond the Korean Peninsula, affecting European security dynamics and U.S. foreign policy.

By supporting North Korea, Russia aims to maintain a foothold in regional geopolitics, leveraging its relationship to negotiate from a position of strength. This strategy is evident in Russia's military posturing and diplomatic efforts, which seek to promote stability while simultaneously challenging U.S. hegemony.
