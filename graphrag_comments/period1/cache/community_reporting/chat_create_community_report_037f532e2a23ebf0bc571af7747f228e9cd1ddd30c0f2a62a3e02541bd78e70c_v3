The initial magnitude of the earthquake was reported at 5.6 but was later upgraded to 6.3, indicating a substantial seismic event. This earthquake is believed to have been triggered by a nuclear missile test, which poses serious risks not only to the environment but also to regional stability. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization is actively analyzing this seismic activity to assess its implications.
