The country's pursuit of nuclear capabilities is not only a means of enhancing its military strength but also serves as a deterrent against perceived threats from other nations. This strategic emphasis on nuclear weapons is central to North Korea's defense posture, reflecting its intent to secure its sovereignty and maintain a position of power on the global stage.
