These exercises are intended to prepare military forces for potential real-world engagements and enhance strategic planning and coordination. However, they have become a focal point of tension, particularly with North Korea, which perceives these drills as provocative actions that could escalate regional hostilities. The ongoing military drills serve as a demonstration of military readiness and a means of deterrence against potential aggression from North Korea, but they also risk inflaming tensions in the region.
