This principle fosters cooperation among member states, particularly in addressing threats from global actors like Russia. NATO's strategic focus includes military readiness and planning, which is crucial for maintaining stability in Europe and North America. The alliance's commitment to mutual defense is underscored by its requirement for member countries to allocate at least 2% of their GDP to defense spending, ensuring military capabilities are robust and responsive to emerging threats.
