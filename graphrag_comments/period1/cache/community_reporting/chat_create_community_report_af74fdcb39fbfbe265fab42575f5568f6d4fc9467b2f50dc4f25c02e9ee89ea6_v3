His tenure was marked by efforts to engage North Korea diplomatically, advocating for direct talks to address the nuclear crisis. Tillerson's approach was influenced by the belief that previous diplomatic efforts had failed, leading him to suggest that initial discussions could pave the way for formal negotiations.
