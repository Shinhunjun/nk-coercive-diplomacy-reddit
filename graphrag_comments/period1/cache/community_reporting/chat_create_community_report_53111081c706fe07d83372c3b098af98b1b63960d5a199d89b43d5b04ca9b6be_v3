The regime's actions have drawn widespread condemnation from the international community, leading to sanctions and diplomatic isolation. Reports indicate that individuals in North Korea face arbitrary detention, torture, and forced labor, creating a dire humanitarian situation. This environment of oppression is a significant factor in the global discourse on human rights and has implications for international relations, particularly with countries like the United States that impose sanctions in response to these abuses [Data: Entities (435); Relationships (628)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"North Korea's Involvement in Terrorism\",\n            \"explanation\": \"There are allegations that North Korea engages in terrorism by selling weapons to terrorist organizations, which serves as a means to avoid retaliation from other nations.
