The deployment of THAAD represents a proactive defense strategy aimed at enhancing South Korea's ability to intercept potential missile attacks. This system has been a focal point of contention in U.S.-North Korea relations, as well as in broader U.S.-China relations, with China viewing THAAD's radar capabilities as a strategic threat. The integration of THAAD into South Korea's defense infrastructure underscores the nation's commitment to national security and regional stability.
