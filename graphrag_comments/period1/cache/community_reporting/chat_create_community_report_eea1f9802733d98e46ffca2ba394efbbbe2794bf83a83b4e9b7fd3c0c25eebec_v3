This plan underscores China's strategic interests in maintaining stability in the region while also protecting its own national security. The plan reflects China's historical role as North Korea's ally and its commitment to supporting the regime against external threats, particularly from the U.S. and its allies. The implications of this plan are significant, as it indicates China's readiness to engage militarily if necessary, which could escalate tensions in the region [Data: Entities (1489); Relationships (2301)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"The Sino-DPRK Mutual Defense Treaty solidifies military cooperation.\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The Sino-DPRK 1961 Mutual Defense Treaty is a formal agreement that obligates China to assist North Korea in the event of an armed attack. This treaty is a cornerstone of the military relationship between the two nations, reinforcing their alliance against perceived threats, particularly from the U.S. The treaty's existence complicates international diplomatic efforts aimed at denuclearizing North Korea, as it provides a security guarantee that North Korea can rely on.

This economic dependency shapes North Korea's policies and governance, as the regime relies heavily on Chinese support for its economy. China's influence extends beyond trade; it also plays a critical role in diplomatic negotiations involving North Korea, often advocating for stability while balancing international sanctions.
