They are economic and political measures aimed at influencing or punishing nations for aggressive actions or violations of international law. The U.N., alongside the United States and other nations, has implemented sanctions against North Korea to curb its nuclear ambitions and military capabilities. These sanctions target various sectors of the North Korean economy, including energy trade and exports, aiming to pressure the regime into compliance with international norms. However, the humanitarian impact of these sanctions raises ethical concerns, as they exacerbate economic difficulties for the North Korean population.
