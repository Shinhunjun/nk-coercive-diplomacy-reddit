The regime's commitment to developing and testing these weapons reflects its prioritization of military capabilities over economic welfare, indicating a strong focus on maintaining power and sovereignty. This strategic emphasis has significant implications for international relations, particularly in discussions surrounding denuclearization and military negotiations.

This doctrine posits that the full-scale use of nuclear weapons by opposing sides would lead to total annihilation, thereby deterring nations from initiating nuclear conflict. North Korea's nuclear arsenal is viewed through this lens, as it seeks to ensure its survival and deter aggression from other nuclear powers.

The potential for fallout from North Korea's nuclear tests raises concerns not only for the immediate area but also for broader regional stability. The implications of fallout extend to public health, ecological damage, and societal disruption, necessitating careful monitoring and management to mitigate its effects.
