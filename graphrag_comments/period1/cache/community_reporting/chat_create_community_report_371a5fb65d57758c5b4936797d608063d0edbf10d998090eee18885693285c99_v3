The regime's lack of tolerance for dissent leads to harsh consequences for individuals who express opposition, resulting in a climate of fear among the populace. Reports from various human rights organizations highlight the oppressive environment in which North Koreans live, where basic freedoms are denied, and violations are rampant.
