Bush, the 43rd President of the United States, is primarily known for initiating the Iraq War in 2003 based on claims of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). This military action has been a focal point of debate regarding its justification and the long-term consequences for Iraq and the region. The Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq was influenced by the perceived threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime, which was accused of harboring WMDs. This invasion led to significant instability in Iraq, resulting in ongoing conflict and humanitarian crises. The ramifications of this decision continue to affect U.S. foreign policy and its relations with other nations, particularly in the Middle East.

His leadership was marked by severe human rights abuses, particularly against ethnic groups such as the Kurds. The U.S. invasion aimed to dismantle his regime, citing the need to eliminate the threat of WMDs. However, the aftermath of the invasion saw the rise of insurgent groups and ongoing violence, raising questions about the effectiveness and morality of the military intervention. The legacy of Saddam Hussein's rule and the Baath Party's influence remain critical to understanding Iraq's current political landscape.
