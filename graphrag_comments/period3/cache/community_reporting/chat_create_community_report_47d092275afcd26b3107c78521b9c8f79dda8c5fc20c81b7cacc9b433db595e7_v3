These sanctions create a complex environment for financial institutions, particularly Chinese banks, which may find themselves caught between compliance with U.S. regulations and maintaining business relations with North Korea. The degree of these sanctions is significant, as they can lead to severe economic repercussions for banks that do not adhere to U.S. policies.
