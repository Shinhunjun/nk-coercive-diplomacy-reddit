Its substantial military capabilities, including the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons at its peak, defined its strategy and contributed to international tensions. The legacy of the Soviet Union continues to influence contemporary discussions on nuclear proliferation, especially in relation to North Korea, which has adopted and modified Soviet military technologies, such as the Romeo-class submarine. This historical context is crucial for understanding current geopolitical challenges and the ongoing threat posed by nuclear weapons.

Negotiated in 2015, the deal sought to limit Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons in exchange for lifting economic sanctions. However, the U.S. withdrawal from the agreement in 2018 under President Trump marked a turning point, straining relations with other signatories and raising concerns about nuclear proliferation. The Iran Deal's implications extend beyond Iran, influencing U.S. foreign policy and regional stability, particularly in relation to North Korea's nuclear ambitions.
