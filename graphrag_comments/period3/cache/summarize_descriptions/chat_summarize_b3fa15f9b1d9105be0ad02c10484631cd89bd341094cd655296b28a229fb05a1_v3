One of the key aspects of Trump's approach was the decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the Middle East, a move that had considerable implications for regional stability. This withdrawal was part of a broader strategy aimed at reducing American military involvement overseas.\n\nIn addition to troop withdrawal, Trump's foreign policy initiatives included a strong focus on enhancing relations between Israel and various Arab nations. His administration sought to foster diplomatic ties and promote peace agreements, which culminated in the Abraham Accords, normalizing relations between Israel and several Arab countries. This marked a significant shift in Middle Eastern geopolitics, as it aimed to reshape alliances and foster cooperation in the region.\n\nOverall, Trump's administration navigated a complex landscape in the Middle East, balancing military withdrawal with efforts to strengthen diplomatic relations, particularly between Israel and its Arab neighbors. This dual approach aimed to redefine U.S. engagement in the region while addressing longstanding conflicts and fostering a new era of cooperation.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 216, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 402, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
