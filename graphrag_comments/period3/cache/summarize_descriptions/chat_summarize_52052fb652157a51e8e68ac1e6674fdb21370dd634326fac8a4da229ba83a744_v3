His tenure was marked by a focus on critical issues, particularly regarding North Korea, where Bolton's influence was notable in the formulation of Trump's policies. Initially, Bolton's appointment as National Security Advisor indicated a close working relationship between him and Trump, with Bolton often perceived as a voice of reason within the administration.\n\nHowever, this relationship took a turn when Trump ultimately decided to fire Bolton from his position. This dismissal signified a shift in Trump's foreign policy approach, suggesting that the president was moving away from Bolton's more hawkish stances. The firing highlighted the complexities and evolving dynamics of their professional relationship, as well as the broader changes in the administration's strategy on international matters.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 236, "total_tokens": 397, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
