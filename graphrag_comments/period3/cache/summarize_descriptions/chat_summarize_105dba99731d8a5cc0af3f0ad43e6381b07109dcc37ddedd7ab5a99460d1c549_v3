These agents are particularly potent and can lead to severe physiological effects, including paralysis and death, making them a tool of choice in military operations and covert assassinations. The use of nerve agents is often associated with high-stakes scenarios, where their effectiveness can be leveraged for strategic advantage.\n\nOne notable instance of a nerve agent's application occurred during the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. This event underscored the alarming role that chemical weapons can play in political assassinations, illustrating how such agents can be employed not only in warfare but also in targeted killings that have significant geopolitical implications. The incident brought global attention to the dangers posed by nerve agents and the ethical concerns surrounding their use in both military and civilian contexts. \n\nOverall, nerve agents represent a grave threat due to their lethal capabilities and the potential for misuse in various forms of conflict and political maneuvering.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 207, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 399, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
