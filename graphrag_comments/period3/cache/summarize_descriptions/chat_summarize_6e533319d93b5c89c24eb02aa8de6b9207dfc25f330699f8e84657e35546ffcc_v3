The UN has imposed a series of sanctions on North Korea in response to its actions and policies, which are viewed as violations of international norms and agreements. These sanctions specifically target North Korea's nuclear program and its missile tests, which have been condemned by the UN as breaches of established bans.\n\nThe UN has consistently addressed North Korea's provocative actions, issuing statements and resolutions that highlight the international community's concerns regarding the country's nuclear tests and missile launches. These measures reflect the UN's commitment to maintaining global security and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. As a result, North Korea remains under significant scrutiny and pressure from the UN, which seeks to curb its nuclear ambitions and promote stability in the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 165, "prompt_tokens": 258, "total_tokens": 423, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
