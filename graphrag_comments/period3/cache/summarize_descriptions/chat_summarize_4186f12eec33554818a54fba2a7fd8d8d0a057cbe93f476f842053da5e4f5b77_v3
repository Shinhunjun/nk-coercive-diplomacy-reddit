As the leader of North Korea, Kim's actions and policies have often been in direct opposition to the objectives of denuclearization. Notably, he has ordered nuclear strikes, which underscores a commitment to maintaining and potentially expanding North Korea's nuclear capabilities. Despite this aggressive stance, there is an expectation that Kim's regime will engage in negotiations regarding denuclearization, particularly in discussions with the United States. This duality in Kim's approach—simultaneously pursuing nuclear advancements while also being involved in diplomatic talks—highlights the complexities of the denuclearization dialogue and the challenges that lie ahead in achieving a peaceful resolution.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 348, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
