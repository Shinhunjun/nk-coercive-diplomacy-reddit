The primary objective of the deal was to curb Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions that had been imposed on the country. This agreement was reached in 2015 between Iran and a group of world powers, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, and Germany.\n\nThe deal established a framework for monitoring and verifying Iran's nuclear activities, ensuring that they remained peaceful. It included provisions for reducing the number of centrifuges Iran could operate, limiting the enrichment of uranium, and increasing the transparency of Iran's nuclear program through inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nHowever, the Iran Deal faced significant political challenges, particularly in the United States. In 2018, President Donald Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the agreement, arguing that it was insufficient in preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons and criticizing its failure to address other issues, such as Iran's ballistic missile program and its regional influence. This withdrawal had a profound impact on U.S. foreign policy and strained relations with other signatories of the deal, who sought to maintain the agreement despite the U.S. exit.\n\nThe re-imposition of economic sanctions by the U.S. following its withdrawal led to increased tensions between Iran and the United States, as well as within the broader Middle East region. Iran responded by gradually stepping back from its commitments under the deal, raising concerns about the potential for nuclear proliferation.\n\nIn summary, the Iran Deal represents a pivotal moment in international diplomacy aimed at preventing nuclear proliferation, with significant implications for U.S. foreign policy and regional stability. Its withdrawal by the Trump administration marked a turning point that has continued to influence discussions around nuclear non-proliferation and international relations in the years that followed.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 385, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 576, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
