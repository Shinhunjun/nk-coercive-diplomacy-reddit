This development is primarily aimed at deterring perceived threats from the United States and its allies, positioning North Korea's ICBMs as a significant threat to the U.S. and other nations. The ongoing advancements in ICBM technology are not only a reflection of North Korea's military ambitions but also a central issue in international relations, particularly in the context of negotiations regarding denuclearization.\n\nThe testing of ICBMs has become a focal point in U.S.-North Korea relations, often leading to heightened tensions and international concern. North Korea's military strategy heavily relies on these missile systems, which are seen as essential for maintaining its defense posture and asserting its sovereignty. The development and testing of ICBMs have been a source of contention, complicating diplomatic efforts and negotiations aimed at reducing nuclear threats in the region.\n\nNorth Korea's ICBM program is characterized by its ongoing advancements, which have raised alarms among global powers, particularly the United States. The North Korean leadership views these missile capabilities as vital for national security and as a means to project power on the international stage. Consequently, the ICBM program has become a significant aspect of North Korea's military strategy, influencing its interactions with other nations and shaping the dynamics of international diplomacy.\n\nIn summary, North Korea's development and testing of ICBMs are central to its military strategy, serving as both a deterrent against perceived threats and a point of contention in international negotiations. The implications of this program extend beyond regional security, affecting global stability and diplomatic relations, particularly with the United States.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 337, "prompt_tokens": 539, "total_tokens": 876, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
