These tests are not merely military exercises; they are designed to signal North Korea's discontent with South Korea's political decisions and actions. As a result, South Korea finds itself in a precarious position, as these missile tests pose a direct threat to its national security. The implications of North Korea's missile capabilities are significant, as they challenge South Korea's defense strategies and heighten the sense of vulnerability among its population and government.
