In the context of North and South Korea, the peace treaty has been a significant topic of discussion in ongoing negotiations, as both nations seek to resolve their long-standing conflict. Despite these discussions, a formal peace treaty has yet to be signed, leaving the situation in a state of ceasefire rather than a definitive resolution.\n\nAdditionally, the concept of a peace treaty extends to the relationship between North Korea and the United States. Similar to the situation with South Korea, a peace treaty intended to end hostilities between North Korea and the United States has not been finalized. This lack of a signed agreement contributes to ongoing tensions and the absence of a formal resolution to the conflicts.\n\nIn summary, the \"PEACE TREATY\" encompasses efforts to formally conclude hostilities between North Korea and both South Korea and the United States. However, as of now, no peace treaty has been signed, resulting in a continued state of ceasefire and unresolved tensions in the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 215, "prompt_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 449, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
