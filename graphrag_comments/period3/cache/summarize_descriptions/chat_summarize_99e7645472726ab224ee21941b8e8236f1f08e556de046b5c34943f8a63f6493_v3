As North Korea was established, the USSR provided crucial support that influenced its political and military development. This assistance was instrumental in helping North Korea solidify its regime and establish itself as a sovereign state in the context of post-World War II geopolitics.\n\nThroughout the Cold War, the USSR continued to support North Korea, reinforcing its military capabilities and providing ideological guidance. This relationship was characterized by a shared communist ideology and mutual interests in countering Western influence in the region. The USSR's backing included military aid, economic assistance, and political support, which were vital for North Korea as it navigated the complexities of international relations during this tumultuous period.\n\nMoreover, the historical context of the USSR's nuclear strategy has had a lasting impact on North Korean policies and its approach to international threats. The legacy of Soviet nuclear doctrine and the emphasis on military strength have influenced North Korea's own nuclear ambitions and its stance on security matters. This connection underscores the enduring effects of Soviet support on North Korea's development as a nuclear power and its ongoing threats in the global arena.\n\nIn summary, the USSR's support was foundational to North Korea's establishment and development, shaping its political landscape and military capabilities during the Cold War. The historical ties between the two nations continue to resonate in North Korea's current policies and its approach to international relations, particularly regarding its nuclear strategy.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 289, "prompt_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 494, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
