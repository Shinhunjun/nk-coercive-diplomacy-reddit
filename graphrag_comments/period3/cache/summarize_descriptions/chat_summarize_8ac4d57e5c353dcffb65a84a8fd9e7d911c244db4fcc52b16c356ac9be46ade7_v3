It plays a pivotal role in regional politics and is often discussed in the context of U.S. foreign policy and military strategy. Historically, Saudi Arabia has been a key ally of the United States, engaging in strategic partnerships that include hosting U.S. troops and receiving significant arms deals, particularly during the Trump administration.\n\nThe country is renowned for its vast oil wealth, which has positioned it as a major player in the global economy. This wealth has also contributed to its political influence, both regionally and internationally. However, Saudi Arabia's governance is marked by authoritarian practices, and it has faced criticism for its controversial human rights record, particularly concerning the treatment of its citizens and residents. The nation has been involved in international discussions regarding human rights and has faced scrutiny for its actions, including its controversial appointment to lead the Human Rights Council.\n\nIn addition to its alliances with the United States, Saudi Arabia is engaged in a long-standing rivalry with Iran, which further complicates its role in Middle Eastern geopolitics. The country is often seen as a stabilizing force in the region, yet its actions and policies have sparked debates about its commitment to human rights and democratic principles.\n\nOverall, Saudi Arabia is a complex entity, balancing its significant economic resources and political alliances with the challenges posed by its governance style and human rights issues. Its influence in global politics, particularly in relation to the United States, continues to shape discussions about security, diplomacy, and regional stability in the Middle East.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 312, "prompt_tokens": 472, "total_tokens": 784, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
