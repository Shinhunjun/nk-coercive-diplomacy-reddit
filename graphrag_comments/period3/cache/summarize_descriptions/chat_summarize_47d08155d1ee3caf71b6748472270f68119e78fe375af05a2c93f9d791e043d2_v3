This sea has recently gained attention due to military activities, specifically the launch of missiles by North Korea into its waters. The East Sea serves as a critical maritime region, not only for its geographical importance but also for its strategic military implications. The dual naming of the sea reflects ongoing regional disputes, with \"East Sea\" being the term preferred by South Korea, while \"Sea of Japan\" is the name used by Japan and recognized in many international contexts. The recent missile launches by North Korea into the East Sea highlight the tensions in the area and underscore the sea's role in geopolitical dynamics.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 147, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 338, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
