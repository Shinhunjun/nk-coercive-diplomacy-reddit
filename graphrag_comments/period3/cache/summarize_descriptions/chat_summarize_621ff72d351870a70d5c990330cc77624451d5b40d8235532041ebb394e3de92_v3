During his presidency, he was actively involved in significant diplomatic efforts, particularly in negotiations with North Korea. These negotiations were aimed at addressing the country's nuclear program and reducing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. \n\nAs the President, Trump represented the United States in these high-stakes discussions, which were characterized by a mix of confrontational rhetoric and attempts at diplomacy. His administration's approach included direct communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, marking a notable shift in U.S. foreign policy towards North Korea. \n\nAfter his term, Trump is referred to as the former President of the United States, but his involvement in the negotiations with North Korea remains a key aspect of his legacy.
