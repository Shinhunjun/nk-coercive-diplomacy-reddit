These sanctions have been implemented in response to North Korea's ongoing missile tests and its ambitions to develop nuclear weapons. The primary objective of these measures is to compel North Korea to denuclearize and to curb its illicit activities, which include various forms of economic and military provocations.\n\nThe sanctions reflect the United States' commitment to international security and non-proliferation efforts, as they seek to pressure the North Korean regime into compliance with global norms regarding nuclear weapons. By targeting key sectors of the North Korean economy and restricting access to financial resources, the United States aims to diminish the regime's capacity to advance its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nOverall, the sanctions imposed by the United States are a strategic response to North Korea's actions, designed to promote stability in the region and to protect the interests of the United States and its allies.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 197, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 420, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
