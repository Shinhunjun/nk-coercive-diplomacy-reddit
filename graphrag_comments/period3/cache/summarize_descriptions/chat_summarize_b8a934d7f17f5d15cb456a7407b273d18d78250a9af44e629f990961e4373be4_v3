This term has become emblematic of the strained relationship and the heightened rhetoric characterizing U.S.-North Korea relations during Trump's presidency. The use of \"Rocket Man\" not only highlights the contentious nature of their interactions but also serves as a reflection of the broader geopolitical dynamics at play, particularly concerning North Korea's missile tests and nuclear ambitions.
