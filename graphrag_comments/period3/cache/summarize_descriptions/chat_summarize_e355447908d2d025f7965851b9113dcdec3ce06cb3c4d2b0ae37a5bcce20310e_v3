He is the grandfather of the current leader, Kim Jong-un. Kim Il-Sung's leadership marked the beginning of a dynastic rule that has continued through his descendants. His legacy is deeply ingrained in North Korean society, where he is venerated as a significant leader.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of Kim Il-Sung's posthumous status is the display of his embalmed body at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang, a site that serves as a mausoleum and a symbol of his enduring influence. This palace is a central location for state ceremonies and is a testament to the cult of personality that surrounds him, which has been perpetuated by the North Korean regime.\n\nUnder Kim Il-Sung's leadership, North Korea adopted a strict communist ideology, which has shaped the country's political landscape and societal structure. His policies and governance style laid the foundation for the North Korean state, which continues to operate under the principles he established. His role as a revolutionary leader and the architect of North Korea's political system has made him a central figure in the nation's identity, with his image and teachings still prominently featured in state propaganda.\n\nOverall, Kim Il-Sung's legacy is characterized by his foundational role in North Korea's history, his establishment of a communist regime, and the ongoing reverence for him within the country, particularly through the continued prominence of his image and the preservation of his body as a national symbol.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 316, "prompt_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 529, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
