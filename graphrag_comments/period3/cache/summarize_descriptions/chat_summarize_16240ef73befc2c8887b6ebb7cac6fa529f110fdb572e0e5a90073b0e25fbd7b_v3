This summit was primarily focused on discussions surrounding North Korea's denuclearization and aimed at improving diplomatic relations between the United States and North Korea. \n\nDuring the summit, both leaders sought to negotiate terms for denuclearization, with the U.S. looking for commitments from North Korea in exchange for sanctions relief. However, the meeting ultimately ended without a formal agreement, primarily due to disputes over sanctions and the specifics of denuclearization commitments. Despite the high hopes surrounding the summit, it is widely regarded as a failure, as the discussions did not yield the desired outcomes for either party.\n\nThe Hanoi Summit was significant as it represented a continuation of diplomatic efforts between the two nations, following their first meeting in Singapore in 2018. However, the lack of a successful agreement at the Hanoi Summit highlighted the complexities and challenges involved in negotiating denuclearization and establishing lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 206, "prompt_tokens": 572, "total_tokens": 778, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
