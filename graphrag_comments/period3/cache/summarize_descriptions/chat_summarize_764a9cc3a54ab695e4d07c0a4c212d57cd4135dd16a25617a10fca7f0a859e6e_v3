This adversarial stance has been a hallmark of Trump's interactions with the media, particularly with CNN, which he has often labeled as \"fake news.\" Despite this ongoing conflict, CNN has extensively covered Trump's actions and statements, especially concerning significant international issues such as North Korea. The network has analyzed and reported on Trump's diplomatic engagements and rhetoric related to North Korea, providing a platform for public discourse on his foreign policy decisions. This duality in their relationship highlights the complex dynamics between Trump and CNN, where criticism coexists with extensive media coverage of his presidency.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 177, "total_tokens": 307, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
