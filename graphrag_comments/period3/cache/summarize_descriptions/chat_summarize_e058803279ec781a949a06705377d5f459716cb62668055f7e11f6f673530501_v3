These sanctions are designed to curb North Korea's military capabilities, limit its economic activities, and influence its government behavior regarding its nuclear ambitions.\n\nThe sanctions against North Korea have been a central aspect of international policy aimed at addressing the regime's aggressive actions and nuclear ambitions. They are intended to pressure the North Korean government to abandon its nuclear weapons program and deter further military provocations. The United States has played a significant role in imposing these sanctions, which also include measures from the United Nations and other countries.\n\nThe sanctions target various aspects of North Korea's activities, including its nuclear weapons development, military tests, and illicit trade. They aim to restrict North Korea's ability to develop nuclear weapons and conduct military operations, thereby influencing its international behavior. The sanctions have also been linked to human rights violations within the country, further complicating the international response to North Korea's actions.\n\nOverall, the sanctions are a policy tool used to address North Korea's nuclear ambitions and military capabilities, with the goal of compelling the regime to engage in denuclearization and adhere to international norms. The ongoing sanctions reflect the international community's commitment to curbing North Korea's nuclear program and promoting stability in the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 268, "prompt_tokens": 1173, "total_tokens": 1441, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
