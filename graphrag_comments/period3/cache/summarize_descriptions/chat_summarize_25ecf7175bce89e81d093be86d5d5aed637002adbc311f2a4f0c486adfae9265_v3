During Trump's administration, the Kurds were recognized as crucial allies in the fight against ISIS, receiving substantial backing from the United States. However, this support became contentious following Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria. This withdrawal was perceived by many, including Kurdish leaders and supporters, as a betrayal of the Kurds, who had relied on American military assistance to combat ISIS and secure their autonomy in the region. The abrupt change in U.S. policy raised concerns about the future of the Kurdish forces and their ability to defend themselves against potential threats, particularly from Turkey, which views Kurdish groups as terrorist organizations. Overall, Trump's approach to the Kurds reflects a broader pattern of shifting U.S. foreign policy priorities and the challenges of maintaining alliances in a volatile geopolitical landscape.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 180, "prompt_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 374, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
