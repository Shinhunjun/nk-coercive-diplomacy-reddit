Geographically close to North Korea, Japan is significantly affected by the latter's military actions and nuclear threats, which have heightened its national security concerns. The Japanese government perceives North Korea as a substantial threat, primarily due to its ongoing military provocations and ambitions to develop nuclear capabilities.\n\nIn response to these threats, Japan has implemented export curbs aimed at preventing North Korea from acquiring banned goods that could enhance its military capabilities. This strategic approach underscores Japan's proactive stance in addressing the risks posed by North Korea's missile programs and nuclear development. Overall, Japan's actions and policies are driven by a need to safeguard its national security while navigating the complex geopolitical landscape of East Asia.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 400, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
