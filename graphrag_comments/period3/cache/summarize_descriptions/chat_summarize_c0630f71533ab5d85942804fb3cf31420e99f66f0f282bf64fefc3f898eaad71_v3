It has a complex and often contentious relationship with its neighboring country, Pakistan, which has been marked by historical conflicts and ongoing tensions, particularly concerning nuclear capabilities. India possesses nuclear weapons, a fact that places it in discussions about global nuclear proliferation, often drawing comparisons to North Korea in terms of the challenges posed by nuclear-armed states.\n\nIn addition to its nuclear status, India is also recognized for its potential role as a trade partner to North Korea.
