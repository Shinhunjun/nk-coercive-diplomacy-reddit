They are primarily utilized to protect domestic industries by making foreign products more expensive, thereby encouraging consumers to purchase locally produced goods. This protective measure can help safeguard jobs and stimulate local economies.\n\nIn the context of recent trade policies, particularly those implemented during Donald Trump's administration, tariffs have played a significant role in shaping international relations. Trump's approach to tariffs was characterized by a focus on renegotiating trade agreements and addressing trade imbalances, which often involved imposing higher tariffs on certain imports. This strategy aimed to bolster American manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign goods, but it also led to tensions with trading partners and sparked retaliatory measures.\n\nMoreover, tariffs are frequently employed as a strategic tool in trade negotiations, allowing governments to leverage economic pressure to achieve favorable terms. By adjusting tariff rates, countries can influence trade flows and negotiate better deals that align with their economic interests. Overall, tariffs are a critical component of trade policy, reflecting a government's priorities in balancing domestic economic protection with international trade relations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 217, "prompt_tokens": 208, "total_tokens": 425, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
