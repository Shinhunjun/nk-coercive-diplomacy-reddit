The primary aim of this summit was to address the issue of denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and to improve relations between the two countries. \n\nDuring this significant event, both leaders engaged in discussions focused on North Korea's nuclear program, which had been a point of contention and concern for the international community. The summit marked a pivotal moment in U.S.-North Korea relations, as it was the first time a sitting U.S. president met with a North Korean leader. \n\nThe outcome of the Singapore Summit included a vague agreement that outlined the commitment to denuclearization, although specific details and timelines were not clearly defined. This ambiguity left room for interpretation and further negotiations in the future. Overall, the Singapore Summit represented a crucial step in diplomatic efforts to address longstanding tensions and foster dialogue between the United States and North Korea.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 278, "total_tokens": 481, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
