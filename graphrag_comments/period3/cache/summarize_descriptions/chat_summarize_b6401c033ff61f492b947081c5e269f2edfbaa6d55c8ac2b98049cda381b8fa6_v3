This policy goal is central to discussions surrounding North Korea's nuclear weapons program and is a key focus of international negotiations aimed at addressing the country's nuclear capabilities.\n\nThe denuclearization policy is not only a significant aspect of North Korea's international relations but also a fundamental element of its security strategy. North Korea's nuclear ambitions are at the heart of the denuclearization discussions, making its nuclear program the primary concern for diplomats and policymakers engaged in these negotiations. The international community views denuclearization as essential for regional and global security, and it remains a pivotal issue in the context of North Korea's interactions with other countries.\n\nNegotiations regarding denuclearization are characterized by the tension between North Korea's desire to retain its nuclear capabilities and the demands from other nations for the complete dismantlement of its nuclear arsenal. This dichotomy highlights the challenges faced in achieving a comprehensive agreement. The policy of denuclearization is aimed at addressing these challenges and is central to diplomatic efforts to mitigate the risks posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons program.\n\nIn summary, denuclearization represents a key policy issue in negotiations with North Korea, focusing on its nuclear capabilities and the broader implications for international security. The discussions surrounding this policy are crucial for understanding North Korea's role in global affairs and the ongoing efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution to the nuclear threat it poses.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 303, "prompt_tokens": 581, "total_tokens": 884, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
