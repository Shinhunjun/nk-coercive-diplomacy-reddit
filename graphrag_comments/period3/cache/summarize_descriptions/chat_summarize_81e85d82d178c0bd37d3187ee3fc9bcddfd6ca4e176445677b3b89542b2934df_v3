The North Korean government has consistently expressed that its refusal to engage in diplomatic discussions is a direct response to the actions and rhetoric of the U.S., which it views as antagonistic. This hostile policy is characterized by various measures, including military posturing, economic sanctions, and critical public statements, all of which contribute to a strained relationship between the two nations.\n\nThe implications of this hostile policy extend beyond mere diplomatic rhetoric; they shape the overall dynamics of international relations involving North Korea. The U.S.'s approach is seen as a barrier to constructive dialogue, leading North Korea to adopt a defensive posture. As a result, North Korea remains steadfast in its refusal to negotiate, believing that any engagement would not be fruitful under the current circumstances dictated by U.S. policy.\n\nIn summary, North Korea's refusal to negotiate is fundamentally rooted in its perception of the United States' hostile policy, which it believes undermines the potential for meaningful diplomatic engagement. This ongoing tension continues to affect the geopolitical landscape in the region and complicates efforts for peace and stability.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 232, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 439, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
