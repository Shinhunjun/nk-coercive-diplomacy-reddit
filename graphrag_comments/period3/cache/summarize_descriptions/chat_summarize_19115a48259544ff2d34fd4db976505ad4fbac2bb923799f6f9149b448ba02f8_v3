These violations are particularly pronounced in North Korea, where the authoritarian regime systematically abuses its citizens. Reports indicate that human rights violations in North Korea encompass a range of severe abuses, including forced labor, sexual violence, and significant restrictions on basic freedoms.\n\nUnder the North Korean government, dissenters face harsh treatment, which further exemplifies the oppressive environment in which citizens live.
