The Korean Peninsula is divided into two main countries: South Korea and North Korea, with South Korea sharing a direct border with its northern counterpart. This proximity has led to a multifaceted relationship marked by both military and diplomatic interactions.\n\nThe geopolitical significance of South Korea is underscored by its strategic location on the Korean Peninsula, which has historically been a focal point of international relations and conflicts.
