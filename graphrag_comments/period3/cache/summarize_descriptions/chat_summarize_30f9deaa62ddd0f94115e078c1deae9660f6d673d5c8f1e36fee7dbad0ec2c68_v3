During his presidency, he negotiated the 1994 nuclear \"Agreed Framework\" deal with North Korea, which aimed to curb the country's nuclear weapons program in exchange for aid and the normalization of relations. This agreement was a pivotal moment in U.S.-North Korea relations, reflecting Clinton's commitment to addressing the challenges posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.
