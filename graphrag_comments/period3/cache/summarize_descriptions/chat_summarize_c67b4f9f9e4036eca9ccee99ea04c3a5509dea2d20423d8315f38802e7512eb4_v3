These missiles have become a significant aspect of North Korea's military capabilities and strategy. North Korea has been actively developing and testing ICBMs, which are capable of being launched from its territory and reaching targets as far away as the United States.\n\nThe development and testing of ICBMs by North Korea serve multiple purposes, including acting as a deterrent in international conflicts and showcasing military strength. The country has conducted numerous tests of these missiles, demonstrating their potential to deliver nuclear payloads effectively. This capability is often referenced in discussions about North Korea's military strategy and its implications for global security.\n\nICBMs are characterized by their long-range capabilities, allowing them to strike targets at significant distances, which enhances North Korea's strategic position. The missiles are viewed as a critical component of North Korea's defense posture, with the regime under Kim Jong-un considering them essential for deterring perceived threats, particularly from the United States.\n\nIn summary, ICBMs represent a crucial element of North Korea's military arsenal, reflecting the nation's ongoing efforts to develop advanced weaponry and assert its power on the international stage. The testing and development of these missiles underscore the tensions in the region and the broader implications for global security dynamics.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 267, "prompt_tokens": 637, "total_tokens": 904, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
