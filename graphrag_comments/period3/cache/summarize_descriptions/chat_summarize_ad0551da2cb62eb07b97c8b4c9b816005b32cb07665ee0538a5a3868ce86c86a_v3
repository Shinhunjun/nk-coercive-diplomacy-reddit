Gaddafi, the former Libyan leader, is frequently cited as a cautionary example in discussions about the risks associated with disarming dictators. Trump's commentary on Gaddafi highlights the potential consequences that can arise when a dictator relinquishes their nuclear capabilities. \n\nIn his remarks, Trump draws parallels between Gaddafi's fate and the broader implications of disarmament, suggesting that the removal of such weapons can lead to vulnerability and, ultimately, downfall. This perspective reflects Trump's foreign policy views, which emphasize the importance of maintaining a strong stance against adversaries and the potential dangers of trusting regimes that may not adhere to agreements. \n\nOverall, the discourse surrounding Gaddafi's downfall serves as a critical reference point for Trump, illustrating the complexities and risks involved in denuclearization efforts and the unpredictable nature of international relations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 391, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
