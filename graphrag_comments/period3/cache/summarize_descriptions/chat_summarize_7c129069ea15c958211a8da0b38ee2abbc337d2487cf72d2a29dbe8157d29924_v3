These missiles are characterized by their trajectory, which follows a ballistic path after the initial powered phase of flight. \n\nNotably, North Korea has developed ballistic missiles that can be launched from both submarines and land-based platforms, showcasing their versatility and strategic capabilities. The ability to launch from submarines adds a layer of stealth and surprise, enhancing the effectiveness of these weapons in military operations. \n\nOverall, ballistic missiles represent a significant advancement in military technology, allowing for the delivery of payloads over extensive distances, and are a critical component of modern defense strategies, particularly for nations like North Korea.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 337, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
