This engagement with digital currencies is seen as a strategic move by the North Korean regime to circumvent international sanctions that have been imposed due to its nuclear weapons program and other illicit activities. By utilizing Bitcoin, North Korea aims to maintain its economic activity despite the restrictions placed on its traditional financial systems. The use of cryptocurrencies allows the country to operate in a more anonymous and decentralized manner, making it more challenging for international authorities to track and regulate its financial transactions. Overall, North Korea's involvement with Bitcoin reflects its broader efforts to adapt to economic pressures and sustain its financial operations in the face of global sanctions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 316, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
