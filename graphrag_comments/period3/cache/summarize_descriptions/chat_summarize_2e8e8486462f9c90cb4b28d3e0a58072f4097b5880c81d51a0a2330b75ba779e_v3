He served as a special envoy for Kim Jong Un and played a crucial role as a key negotiator during the summit with then-President Donald Trump. However, following the failure of the Hanoi Summit, which did not yield the expected results, Kim Hyok Chol faced severe repercussions. Reports indicate that he was executed by Kim Jong Un, marking a notable instance of a purge within the North Korean leadership. This action was part of a broader pattern of eliminating officials deemed responsible for the unsuccessful negotiations, highlighting the intense pressure and accountability within Kim Jong Un's regime. The execution of Kim Hyok Chol underscores the risks associated with diplomatic engagements in North Korea and reflects the regime's approach to managing failures in international relations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 250, "total_tokens": 424, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
