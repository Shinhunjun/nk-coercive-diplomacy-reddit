These missiles are a crucial component of North Korea's military strategy and serve as a key element of its nuclear deterrence policy. The country is actively preparing to test an ICBM, which raises considerable concerns regarding its nuclear capabilities and the potential implications for regional and global security.\n\nThe development of ICBMs by North Korea is viewed with alarm by the international community, as these weapons can reach targets across vast distances, thereby enhancing North Korea's military reach and threatening other nations. The ongoing efforts to refine and expand its ICBM arsenal are indicative of North Korea's commitment to bolstering its defense mechanisms and asserting its position on the global stage.\n\nIn summary, North Korea's focus on intercontinental ballistic missiles is a central aspect of its military strategy, aimed at strengthening its nuclear deterrent and preparing for potential tests that could further escalate tensions in the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 197, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 414, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
