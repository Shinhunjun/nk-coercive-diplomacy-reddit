His administration prioritized diplomatic talks aimed at denuclearization, reflecting a significant aspect of U.S. foreign policy during his tenure. Trump expressed a willingness to engage with North Korea's leadership, despite the country's authoritarian regime, which added layers of complexity to the diplomatic efforts.\n\nThroughout his presidency, Trump sought to normalize relations with the DPRK, a goal that involved direct negotiations concerning North Korea's nuclear program. These discussions were marked by a mix of optimism and skepticism, as Trump aimed to address the longstanding tensions between the two nations. His approach included high-profile summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, which were unprecedented in U.S.-North Korea relations and aimed at fostering dialogue and reducing nuclear threats.\n\nOverall, Trump's engagement with the DPRK was characterized by a blend of diplomatic initiatives and a willingness to confront the challenges posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions, making it a defining feature of his foreign policy agenda.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 221, "prompt_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 452, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
