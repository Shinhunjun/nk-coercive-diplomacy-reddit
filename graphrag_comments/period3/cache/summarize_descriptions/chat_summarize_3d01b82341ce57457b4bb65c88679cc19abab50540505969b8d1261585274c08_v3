In response to North Korea's ongoing nuclear activities, the Security Council frequently convenes to discuss the implications of these actions on international security. The Council has imposed a series of sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear ambitions and ensuring the maintenance of international peace and security.\n\nThese sanctions reflect a regulatory relationship between the UN Security Council and North Korea, as the Council seeks to hold the nation accountable for its provocative actions. The discussions within the Security Council highlight the international community's concern over North Korea's military developments and their potential threat to regional and global stability. Through these measures, the UN Security Council aims to deter further escalation of tensions and promote diplomatic solutions to the challenges posed by North Korea's nuclear program.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 165, "prompt_tokens": 232, "total_tokens": 397, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
