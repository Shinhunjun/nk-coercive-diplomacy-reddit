He has been actively involved in nuclear talks with the United States since early 2018, serving as a key counterpart to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during these negotiations. His background includes serving as a former spy master and vice chairman of the ruling Workers' Party, which underscores his influence within the North Korean regime.\n\nDespite his high-profile position, Kim Yong-chol's career has faced challenges, particularly following the failed summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump. Reports indicate that he experienced a notable downfall after this event, leading to speculation about his future within the government. Initially, there were erroneous reports suggesting that he had been sent to a labor camp as a consequence of the summit's outcome. However, it was later clarified that he was instead dismissed from his role and reassigned to work in Jagang Province, indicating a significant reduction in his influence.\n\nOverall, Kim Yong-chol's trajectory reflects the volatile nature of North Korean politics, particularly in the context of international negotiations and the internal power dynamics of the regime. His involvement in high-stakes discussions with the U.S. has marked him as a key figure in North Korea's diplomatic efforts, even as he navigates the repercussions of political setbacks.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 274, "prompt_tokens": 320, "total_tokens": 594, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
