One of his most notable actions was the withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was initially established during Barack Obama's presidency. This withdrawal signified a stark departure from the previous administration's diplomatic approach, leading to heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran.\n\nIn conjunction with exiting the nuclear agreement, Trump implemented a series of stringent economic sanctions aimed at crippling Iran's economy. These sanctions were part of a broader hardline strategy that sought to pressure Iran into renegotiating its nuclear program and curtailing its regional influence. Trump's administration adopted a confrontational stance, which was characterized by a willingness to escalate rhetoric and military posturing, further straining diplomatic relations.\n\nThe approach taken by Trump's administration was markedly different from that of his predecessor, Obama, who favored engagement and negotiation as means to address concerns regarding Iran's nuclear ambitions. Trump's policies have been described as contentious, reflecting a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy that emphasized isolation and pressure over diplomacy.\n\nOverall, Donald Trump's tenure was defined by a confrontational and hardline approach towards Iran, characterized by the withdrawal from the nuclear deal and the imposition of sanctions, which collectively contributed to a deteriorating relationship between the two countries.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 286, "prompt_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 511, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
