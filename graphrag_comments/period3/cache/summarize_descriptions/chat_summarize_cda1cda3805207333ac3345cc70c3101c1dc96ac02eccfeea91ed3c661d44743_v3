Denuclearization efforts are frequently associated with the potential lifting of sanctions imposed on North Korea. These sanctions, which have been established by various international bodies in response to North Korea's nuclear activities, serve as a significant barrier to the country's denuclearization initiatives. The presence of these sanctions complicates negotiations, as North Korea may view the lifting of sanctions as a necessary incentive for committing to denuclearization. Thus, the interplay between denuclearization and sanctions is crucial in understanding the dynamics of diplomatic efforts aimed at addressing North Korea's nuclear ambitions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 127, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 308, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
