He served in this role under President Donald Trump and is recognized for his strong stance on various international issues, particularly concerning North Korea and Iran. Bolton's approach to foreign policy has often been characterized by a preference for military action and a critical view of diplomatic negotiations, which he believes may compromise U.S. security interests.\n\nThroughout his career, Bolton has held several significant positions, including serving as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. His expertise extends to Middle Eastern affairs, where he has advocated for a more aggressive U.S. posture. Bolton's tenure as National Security Advisor was marked by his vocal criticism of the Trump administration's strategies, especially regarding North Korea's nuclear program. After his departure from the White House, he continued to express concerns about Trump's approach, arguing for a tougher stance against North Korea and warning about the implications of its missile tests for international security.\n\nBolton's views on North Korea are particularly notable; he has been an outspoken advocate for military options and has criticized any efforts to reverse sanctions on the country. He has described North Korea's nuclear disarmament as a critical issue and has warned against the dangers posed by its missile capabilities. His advocacy for a hardline approach has led to him being labeled a \"chicken-hawk,\" a term used to describe individuals who promote military action without having served in combat themselves.\n\nDespite his controversial views, Bolton's influence in U.S. foreign policy discussions remains significant. His hawkish stance has shaped debates on how the U.S. should engage with adversarial nations, and he continues to be a prominent voice in discussions surrounding national security and military strategy. Overall, John Bolton is recognized as a key figure in contemporary American foreign policy, known for his assertive and often contentious positions on international relations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 374, "prompt_tokens": 508, "total_tokens": 882, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
