Critics argue that Trump's approach to international relations has often overlooked or minimized the importance of human rights, leading to concerns about the potential for genocidal actions in certain contexts.\n\nAdditionally, Trump's statements regarding Mexico have faced scrutiny for inciting violence and fostering a narrative that could contribute to genocidal policies. His rhetoric has been perceived as inflammatory, potentially encouraging harmful attitudes and actions towards specific groups.
