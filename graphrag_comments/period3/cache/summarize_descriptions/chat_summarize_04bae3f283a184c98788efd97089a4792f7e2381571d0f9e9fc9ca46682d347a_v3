These attacks can take various forms, including data breaches, ransomware, and denial-of-service attacks, and they pose significant threats to national security and economic stability. One notable actor in the realm of cyber attacks is North Korea, which has been linked to such activities as a means of generating revenue, particularly in the context of evading international sanctions.
