This summit was significant as it represented a continuation of diplomatic engagement between North Korea and the United States following previous meetings. However, the summit ultimately ended without a formal agreement, leading to heightened tensions and consequences for Kim Jong Un's administration. Notably, following the summit's failure, Kim Jong Un executed his envoy, reflecting the internal repercussions of the diplomatic setback. The Hanoi Summit thus stands out as a pivotal moment in U.S.-North Korea relations, highlighting both the potential for dialogue and the challenges that arise in negotiations over nuclear disarmament.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 148, "prompt_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 359, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
