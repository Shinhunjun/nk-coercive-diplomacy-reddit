His leadership spanned several decades, during which he became a prominent figure in both Libyan and international politics. Gaddafi's regime was marked by a mix of populist rhetoric and oppressive governance, leading to widespread criticism and resistance within Libya.\n\nGaddafi's decision to denuclearize Libya is often referenced in discussions about nuclear disarmament. He voluntarily gave up his chemical weapons and nuclear ambitions in the early 2000s, a move that was initially seen as a step towards improving relations with the West. However, this decision later became a focal point in discussions about the consequences of denuclearization, particularly in light of the political instability that followed his downfall.\n\nIn 2011, during the Libyan Civil War, Gaddafi was overthrown and killed, an event that has since been viewed as a cautionary tale regarding the risks associated with relinquishing nuclear capabilities. His downfall is frequently cited as an example of how countries that abandon their nuclear programs may become vulnerable to external threats and internal upheaval. The aftermath of his removal from power led to significant chaos and instability in Libya, raising questions about the effectiveness of denuclearization as a strategy for ensuring national security.\n\nOverall, Gaddafi's legacy is complex, characterized by his long and controversial rule, his engagement in nuclear disarmament discussions, and the dire consequences that followed his decision to abandon Libya's weapons programs. His story serves as a critical case study in the broader discourse on nuclear policy and international relations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 322, "prompt_tokens": 368, "total_tokens": 690, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
