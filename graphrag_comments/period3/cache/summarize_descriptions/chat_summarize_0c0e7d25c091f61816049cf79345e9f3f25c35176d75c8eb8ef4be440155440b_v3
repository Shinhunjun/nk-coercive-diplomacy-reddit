They are propelled to their targets and are often associated with military conflicts. North Korea has been particularly noted for its extensive missile testing, which has included various types of missiles, such as short-range projectiles. These tests have raised concerns and contributed to heightened tensions with neighboring countries, including the United States and South Korea.\n\nNorth Korea has conducted missile launches toward the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan, and has developed missiles capable of delivering explosive payloads that could potentially reach U.S. cities. The country has confirmed the recent firing of short-range missiles, which are characterized by their significant speed and distance capabilities. Reports from South Korea and Japan have documented these missile launches, which have included both identified and unidentified missiles.\n\nThe missile activities of North Korea have not only been a demonstration of military capability but have also served as a source of alarm for neighboring nations, particularly Japan, which has been threatened by North Korea's missile programs. The ongoing missile tests and threats have underscored the strategic military considerations in the region, often discussed in the context of North Korea's nuclear capabilities.\n\nIn summary, missiles are guided weapons used by North Korea for military purposes, with a focus on their testing and launch activities that have implications for regional security and international relations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 277, "prompt_tokens": 442, "total_tokens": 719, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
