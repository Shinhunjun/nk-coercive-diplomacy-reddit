The country has prioritized the advancement of its weapons programs, which include nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities, as a means to bolster its defense and assert its sovereignty on the global stage. This focus on weapons development is not only a matter of national security for North Korea but also a significant factor in its interactions with other nations, particularly in the context of ongoing tensions with the United States and its allies.\n\nThe international community closely monitors North Korea's weapons programs, as they pose a challenge to regional stability and global security. The country's actions in this domain have led to a series of sanctions and diplomatic efforts aimed at curbing its military ambitions. North Korea's insistence on continuing its weapons development, despite international pressure, underscores the centrality of this issue in its foreign policy and diplomatic negotiations.\n\nIn summary, North Korea's weapons development is a pivotal aspect of its military strategy and a key element in its international relations, influencing both its domestic policies and its interactions with the global community.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 216, "prompt_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 398, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
