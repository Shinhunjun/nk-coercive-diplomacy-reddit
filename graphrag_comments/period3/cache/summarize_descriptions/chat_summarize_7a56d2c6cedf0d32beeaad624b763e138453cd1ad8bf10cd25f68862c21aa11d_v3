This relationship is characterized by ongoing tensions, particularly surrounding issues of nuclear disarmament. The DPRK's government frequently criticizes the United States, portraying it as a primary adversary in the realm of international relations. \n\nThe United States, in turn, has engaged in various diplomatic efforts aimed at addressing the nuclear ambitions of North Korea, often leading to negotiations that seek to achieve denuclearization. However, these efforts have been complicated by the DPRK's defiant stance and its continued development of nuclear weapons, which the U.S. views as a significant threat to regional and global security.\n\nOverall, the interactions between the DPRK and the United States reflect a complex dynamic of hostility and occasional dialogue, underscored by the broader geopolitical implications of their relationship.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 186, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 393, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
