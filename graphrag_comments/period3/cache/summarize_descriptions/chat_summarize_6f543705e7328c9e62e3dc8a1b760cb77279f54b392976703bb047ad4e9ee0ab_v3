It is often associated with significant global issues, such as nuclear disarmament and trade agreements. A notable example of such a deal is the series of agreements made between former U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea, which focused on denuclearization and the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two nations. These negotiations aimed to address the longstanding tensions on the Korean Peninsula and sought to promote peace and stability through mutual agreements.
