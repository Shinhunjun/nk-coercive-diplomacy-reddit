The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has consistently addressed these issues, emphasizing that North Korea's missile tests are in direct violation of the resolutions established by the Council. These resolutions aim to curb North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and to prevent the country from conducting further missile tests.\n\nIn addition to the missile tests, the UNSC has also focused on human rights violations within North Korea, highlighting the need for accountability and reform. The Council has imposed a series of sanctions against North Korea as a means to pressure the regime into compliance with international norms and to promote stability in the region.\n\nFurthermore, the UNSC is actively working to ensure that member states, including Russia, adhere to these sanctions. One specific area of concern is the return of North Korean laborers who are working abroad, which the Council views as a violation of the sanctions imposed on North Korea. The UNSC's efforts reflect a broader strategy to isolate North Korea economically and diplomatically, thereby compelling the regime to reconsider its aggressive military posture and human rights practices.\n\nOverall, the relationship between North Korea and the United Nations Security Council is characterized by ongoing tensions and a concerted effort by the international community to address the challenges posed by North Korea's actions on the global stage.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 272, "prompt_tokens": 248, "total_tokens": 520, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
