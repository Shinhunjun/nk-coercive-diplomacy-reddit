His administration imposed sanctions to limit North Korea's missile development and to curb its nuclear program, reflecting a strong stance against the regime's aggressive actions.\n\nThroughout his term, Trump's administration exhibited a fluctuating approach to sanctions on North Korea. While initially imposing strict sanctions, there were instances where the administration reversed or lifted certain sanctions as part of diplomatic negotiations. This back-and-forth indicated a direct policy relationship with North Korea, suggesting that sanctions were not only a tool for pressure but also a bargaining chip in diplomatic discussions.\n\nTrump's administration had the authority to grant sanctions relief, which it utilized in the context of engaging with North Korean leadership. This approach was marked by a willingness to negotiate, as seen in the high-profile summits between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. However, the reversal of some sanctions that had been imposed by the previous Obama administration signified a notable shift in U.S. policy towards North Korea under Trump.\n\nOverall, Trump's policies regarding sanctions on North Korea were characterized by a combination of imposition and relief, reflecting a complex and evolving strategy aimed at addressing the challenges posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 266, "prompt_tokens": 385, "total_tokens": 651, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
