These negotiations involve key leaders, including former U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who have engaged in dialogue aimed at managing not only North Korea's nuclear capabilities but also its missile programs.\n\nThe primary objective of these negotiations is to achieve a comprehensive denuclearization of North Korea, which includes the dismantling of its nuclear arsenal and the cessation of missile development activities. The discussions also address the sanctions imposed on North Korea as a result of its nuclear ambitions, seeking a pathway to alleviate these sanctions in exchange for verifiable steps towards denuclearization.\n\nOverall, nuclear negotiations represent a complex interplay of diplomacy, security concerns, and geopolitical strategy, as the involved parties strive to mitigate the threats posed by North Korea's nuclear and missile programs while fostering stability and peace in the Korean Peninsula.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 200, "prompt_tokens": 253, "total_tokens": 453, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
