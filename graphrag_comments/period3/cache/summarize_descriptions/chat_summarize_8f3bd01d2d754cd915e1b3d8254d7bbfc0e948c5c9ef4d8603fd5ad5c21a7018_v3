These tests serve multiple purposes, including demonstrating a nation's nuclear capabilities and advancing its technological expertise in weaponry. \n\nOne of the most notable examples of nuclear testing in recent history is the series of tests conducted by North Korea. These tests have been a significant source of international tension and concern, as they not only showcase North Korea's advancing nuclear capabilities but also pose a threat to regional and global security. The international community has responded to North Korea's nuclear tests with various diplomatic and economic measures aimed at curbing its nuclear ambitions.\n\nOverall, nuclear tests are critical events that reflect a country's military strategy and geopolitical stance, while also raising alarms about the potential for nuclear proliferation and the associated risks to global peace and stability.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 218, "total_tokens": 388, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
