He was known for being a vocal critic of his brother and the North Korean regime. After spending many years outside of North Korea, Kim Jong-nam was assassinated in 2017 in Malaysia, an event that significantly heightened tensions between North Korea and other nations.\n\nThe assassination of Kim Jong-nam occurred through a poisoning incident, which drew international attention and condemnation. His death was not only a personal tragedy but also a political maneuver that underscored the lengths to which the North Korean government would go to eliminate perceived threats to its leadership. Reports indicate that Kim Jong-nam had been an informant for the CIA, providing intelligence during meetings in Singapore and Malaysia, which may have contributed to the motivations behind his assassination.\n\nOverall, Kim Jong-nam's life and untimely death reflect the complex dynamics of power within the North Korean leadership and the broader geopolitical implications of North Korea's actions on the world stage.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 205, "prompt_tokens": 286, "total_tokens": 491, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
