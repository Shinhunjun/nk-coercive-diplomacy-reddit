This jurisdiction is crucial in various contexts, particularly in discussions surrounding military actions and the principles of sovereignty. Territorial waters typically extend up to 12 nautical miles from a state's baseline, which is usually the low-water line along the coast. Within this zone, the state has the right to enforce laws, regulate resource use, and control passage, making it a significant area for national security and international relations.\n\nThe concept of territorial waters is also deeply intertwined with international law, as it establishes the legal framework for how states interact with one another in maritime contexts. This includes the rights of passage for foreign vessels, the enforcement of laws against illegal activities, and the management of natural resources. The significance of territorial waters is underscored in discussions about military actions, as states must navigate the complexities of sovereignty and jurisdiction when conducting operations in or near these waters.\n\nIn summary, territorial waters are a critical aspect of a state's jurisdiction, impacting military strategy, international law, and the management of maritime resources.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 406, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
