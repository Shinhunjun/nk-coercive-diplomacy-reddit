The country has been significantly affected by Russian military actions, notably the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. These events have escalated into a broader conflict that has drawn the attention of the international community and has been a critical issue in U.S. foreign policy discussions.\n\nIn recent years, Ukraine has received substantial military and economic support from various nations, including Germany and the United States. This assistance has been crucial for Ukraine as it seeks to bolster its defense capabilities against Russian aggression.
