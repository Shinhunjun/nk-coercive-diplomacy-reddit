These events are characterized by their elaborate performances, which often involve thousands of participants, including gymnasts, dancers, and musicians, all synchronized to create a visually stunning display. The Mass Games are not only a celebration of North Korean culture but also function as a significant propaganda spectacle aimed at promoting national pride and boosting morale among the populace.\n\nDespite their grandeur and the sense of national unity they aim to foster, the Mass Games have faced criticism, particularly under the leadership of Kim Jong-un. While they are intended to highlight the achievements of the regime and reinforce its ideological narratives, some observers have pointed out the underlying issues related to human rights and the conditions under which participants are trained and perform. The event is thus a complex blend of cultural expression and political messaging, reflecting both the artistic capabilities of the nation and the regime's efforts to maintain control over its citizens through spectacle and propaganda.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 396, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
