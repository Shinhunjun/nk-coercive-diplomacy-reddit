These projectiles are a significant aspect of North Korea's military capabilities and are frequently discussed in the context of international security. The country is known for its provocative military activities, which include the regular launching of projectiles to showcase its advancements in weaponry.\n\nThe projectiles serve not only as a demonstration of military strength but also as a means of asserting North Korea's position on the global stage.
