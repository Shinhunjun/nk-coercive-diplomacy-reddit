These weapons are designed to be launched and guided towards specific targets, making them a critical aspect of military capabilities for nations, including North Korea. The country has developed and tested various missile systems, which are often showcased during military demonstrations.\n\nNorth Korea's missile program has raised international concerns due to its implications for military strategy and international relations. The missiles, which include short-range ballistic missiles, have been a focal point in negotiations with the United States and have contributed to heightened tensions in the region. The testing of these missiles is frequently viewed as a demonstration of military strength and a warning to neighboring countries, particularly South Korea.\n\nThe missiles are not only a tool for military engagement but also a source of contention in global diplomacy. Their development and testing have been met with international scrutiny, especially as some of these activities are perceived to violate United Nations sanctions. The missiles fired by North Korea are capable of traveling significant distances, which has been confirmed by military assessments, further escalating concerns about their potential use in conflict.\n\nOverall, North Korea's missile program is characterized by ongoing testing and development, which continues to be a central issue in discussions surrounding security and stability in the region. The missiles serve as both a military asset and a point of leverage in international negotiations, reflecting the complex dynamics of North Korea's interactions with the global community.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 294, "prompt_tokens": 554, "total_tokens": 848, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
