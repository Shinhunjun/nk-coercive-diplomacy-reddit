Over the years, Rodman has visited North Korea multiple times, during which he has met with Kim Jong Un on several occasions. These visits have contributed to the development of a unique bond between the two, characterized by mutual respect and understanding.\n\nRodman's interactions with Kim have been notable for their unconventional nature, as he is one of the few Western figures to engage with the North Korean leader directly. This relationship has drawn significant media attention and has sparked discussions about the potential for sports and cultural exchanges to serve as a bridge in international relations. Rodman's visits have often included basketball exhibitions and other cultural events, which he has used as a means to connect with Kim and the North Korean people.\n\nThrough these engagements, Rodman has positioned himself as a somewhat controversial figure in the realm of diplomacy, often blurring the lines between sports and politics. His efforts have been met with mixed reactions, with some viewing him as a peacemaker while others criticize his approach and the legitimacy of his influence. Nonetheless, the personal rapport he has cultivated with Kim Jong Un remains a distinctive aspect of his visits to North Korea, highlighting the potential for personal relationships to impact international diplomacy.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 267, "prompt_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 501, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
