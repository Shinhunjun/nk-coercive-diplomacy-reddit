His presidency was characterized by a distinctive approach that significantly influenced diplomatic relations, especially with countries such as Iran and North Korea. Trump's foreign policy strategies have drawn both attention and criticism, with many labeling them as ineffective and fraudulent.\n\nDuring his time in office, Trump adopted a unique stance towards North Korea, engaging in unprecedented direct diplomacy with its leader, Kim Jong-un. This approach aimed to address the longstanding tensions surrounding North Korea's nuclear program. However, despite the high-profile summits and rhetoric of denuclearization, critics argue that Trump's foreign policy did not yield substantial results, leading to perceptions of ineffectiveness.\n\nIn addition to North Korea, Trump's foreign policy also involved a contentious relationship with Iran. His administration's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), marked a significant shift in U.S. policy towards the Middle East. This withdrawal was met with widespread criticism, as many believed it undermined diplomatic efforts and escalated tensions in the region.\n\nOverall, Trump's foreign policy has been a subject of intense debate, with supporters arguing that his unconventional methods brought new opportunities for dialogue, while detractors contend that his approach was fraught with risks and ultimately failed to achieve its objectives. The legacy of Trump's foreign policy continues to influence discussions on international relations and the future direction of U.S. diplomacy.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 301, "prompt_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 529, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
