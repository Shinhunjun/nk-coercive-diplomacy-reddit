This doctrine asserts that if two or more nuclear-armed states engage in full-scale use of nuclear weapons, the result would be the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender. The underlying principle of MAD is that the catastrophic consequences of a nuclear exchange serve as a powerful deterrent, discouraging states from initiating an attack against one another.\n\nThe concept of MAD relies on the understanding that the certainty of mutual destruction creates a stable balance of power, as no rational actor would willingly engage in a conflict that would lead to their own demise. This doctrine has played a significant role in shaping international relations and military strategies during the Cold War and continues to influence nuclear policy today. By ensuring that both sides are aware of the dire repercussions of nuclear warfare, MAD aims to maintain peace and prevent escalation into full-scale conflict.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 452, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
