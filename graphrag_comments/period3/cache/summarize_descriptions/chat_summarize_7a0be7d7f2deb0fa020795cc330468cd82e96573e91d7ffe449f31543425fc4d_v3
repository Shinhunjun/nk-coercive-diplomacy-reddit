Both cities were subjected to atomic bombings by the United States in August 1945, marking pivotal moments in the conflict and the broader narrative of nuclear warfare. These bombings not only resulted in immense destruction and loss of life but also served as a catalyst for discussions surrounding the ethical implications and consequences of nuclear weapons.\n\nHiroshima was bombed on August 6, 1945, when the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" was dropped, leading to catastrophic damage and an estimated 140,000 deaths by the end of that year. Three days later, on August 9, 1945, Nagasaki was bombed with the atomic bomb \"Fat Man,\" resulting in approximately 70,000 deaths. The bombings of these two cities are often referenced together in historical discussions, symbolizing the devastating impact of nuclear warfare and the urgent need for peace and disarmament.\n\nThe events in Hiroshima and Nagasaki have left lasting legacies, influencing international relations, military strategy, and public perception of nuclear weapons. They serve as reminders of the horrors of war and the importance of striving for a world free from nuclear arms. The cities have since become sites of remembrance and education, with memorials and museums dedicated to the victims and the lessons learned from these tragic events.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 280, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 482, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
