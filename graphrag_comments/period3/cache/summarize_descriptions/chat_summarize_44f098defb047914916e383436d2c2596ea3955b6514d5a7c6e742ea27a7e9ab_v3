This relationship suggests a significant level of interest from the CIA in Kim Jong Nam, likely due to his unique position as a potential source of information regarding North Korea's internal dynamics and leadership. Furthermore, it has been indicated that Kim Jong Nam was working as an informant for the CIA, which implies a professional relationship between him and the agency. This collaboration may have involved the sharing of intelligence that could be valuable to U.S. interests, particularly in understanding the workings of the North Korean regime.
