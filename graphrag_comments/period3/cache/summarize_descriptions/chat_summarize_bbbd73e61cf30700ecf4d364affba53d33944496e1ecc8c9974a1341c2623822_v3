He is widely recognized for his hawkish views on foreign policy, particularly concerning North Korea and Iran. Bolton's approach to international relations has been characterized by a strong advocacy for military intervention and sanctions, reflecting a hardline stance that has garnered both support and criticism.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Bolton was involved in significant discussions regarding U.S. foreign policy, especially in relation to North Korea's nuclear disarmament. He notably referenced the \"Libyan model\" as a potential framework for negotiations, which sparked considerable debate and controversy. His comments on North Korea's missile program further underscored his aggressive posture towards the regime, positioning him as a key figure in shaping U.S. strategy in the region.\n\nDespite his influential role, Bolton's tenure was marked by tension and conflict, leading to his eventual dismissal from the Trump administration. His sacking raised questions about the future direction of U.S. foreign policy, particularly regarding North Korea, and highlighted the divisive nature of his approach. Many individuals view Bolton negatively, associating him with the sabotage of diplomatic negotiations, including those related to prisoner or hostage releases.\n\nIn addition to his focus on North Korea, Bolton's foreign policy views have also extended to other global issues, including relations with Iran and tensions with China, particularly following his meetings with Taiwan. His controversial statements and actions have made him a polarizing figure in U.S. politics, often eliciting strong reactions from both supporters and detractors.\n\nOverall, John Bolton's legacy as National Security Advisor is defined by his aggressive foreign policy stance, particularly towards North Korea, and his advocacy for military solutions in international conflicts. His influence continues to be felt in discussions surrounding U.S. foreign relations, as his views remain a significant point of reference in the ongoing debates about America's role on the global stage.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 378, "prompt_tokens": 763, "total_tokens": 1141, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
