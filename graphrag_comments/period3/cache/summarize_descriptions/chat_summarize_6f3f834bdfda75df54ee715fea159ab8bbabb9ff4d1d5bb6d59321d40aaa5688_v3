This period was marked by intense rivalry between the USSR and the United States, characterized by nuclear threats and a struggle for ideological dominance. The geopolitical dynamics established during this time continue to influence international relations today.\n\nAs a major global power, the USSR exerted considerable influence over various nations, particularly in Asia. One of the most notable examples of this influence was its relationship with North Korea. The USSR supported North Korea's political and military strategies, providing essential aid and forming alliances that shaped the country's early development. This support was crucial in establishing North Korea as a significant player in the region, particularly in the context of its conflict with South Korea and its stance against Western powers.\n\nOverall, the USSR's actions during the Cold War not only defined its own legacy as a superpower but also had lasting effects on the political landscape of countries like North Korea, which continue to resonate in contemporary geopolitical affairs.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 207, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 430, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
