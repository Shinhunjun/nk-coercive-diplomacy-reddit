This policy, which was first introduced in the late 1990s, emphasizes dialogue and cooperation over confrontation, aiming to create a peaceful and stable environment on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nDuring his presidency, Moon Jae In sought to restore and revitalize the principles of the Sunshine Policy as a central component of his administration's approach to North Korea. He believed that by re-engaging with the North, it would be possible to reduce tensions and promote mutual understanding. Moon's commitment to this policy was evident in his efforts to facilitate high-level talks and summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, marking a significant shift in South Korea's foreign policy direction.\n\nThe Sunshine Policy's core tenet is the belief that engagement and economic cooperation can lead to a more peaceful coexistence between the two Koreas. Moon Jae In's administration aimed to build on this foundation by advocating for increased dialogue, cultural exchanges, and economic collaboration, which he viewed as essential for long-term stability and peace in the region.\n\nIn summary, Moon Jae In's policies were deeply rooted in the principles of the Sunshine Policy, which he sought to restore and implement during his presidency to enhance relations with North Korea. His administration's focus on engagement and dialogue reflects a commitment to the ideals of the Sunshine Policy, aiming for a more peaceful and cooperative future on the Korean Peninsula.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 304, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 496, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
