This form of labor is not only a domestic issue but also extends internationally, as North Korea employs a policy of sending workers abroad under oppressive conditions to generate income. These workers often face severe restrictions on their freedom, inadequate living conditions, and minimal compensation, all of which contribute to the broader narrative of exploitation and abuse associated with the regime's labor practices.
