Over the course of these visits, Rodman has engaged with Kim in a manner that transcends typical diplomatic interactions, often describing their bond as a friendship. This unique relationship has garnered significant media attention, as Rodman is one of the few Western figures to have established such a connection with the North Korean leader. Their interactions have included basketball exhibitions and cultural exchanges, which Rodman has often framed as efforts to promote peace and understanding between North Korea and the United States.
