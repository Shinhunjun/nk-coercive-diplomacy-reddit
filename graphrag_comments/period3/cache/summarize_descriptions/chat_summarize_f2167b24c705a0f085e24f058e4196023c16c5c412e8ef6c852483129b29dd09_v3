North Korea has made significant advancements in its weapons arsenal, notably in the areas of nuclear capabilities and short-range missile technology. These developments have raised substantial international concerns, particularly among the United States and its allies, who view them as threats to regional and global security.\n\nIn addition to North Korea's specific weapons programs, the term \"weapons\" also refers to the broader category of military tools that are utilized and traded globally. For instance, the United States engages in the sale of various weapons to countries such as Saudi Arabia, which is a key aspect of its foreign policy. This arms trade is often aimed at strengthening alliances and enhancing the military capabilities of partner nations.\n\nOverall, the discussion surrounding \"WEAPONS\" highlights the dual nature of military tools: on one hand, the alarming advancements in weaponry by nations like North Korea, and on the other, the strategic use of arms sales by countries like the United States to influence international relations and security dynamics.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 218, "prompt_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 423, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
