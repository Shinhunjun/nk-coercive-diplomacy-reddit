These missiles are characterized by their ability to navigate and reach their targets with high accuracy, which enhances their effectiveness in military operations. \n\nCruise missiles are often equipped with advanced guidance systems that allow them to fly at low altitudes, avoiding radar detection and increasing their chances of successfully hitting their intended targets. This capability makes them a critical asset in both offensive and defensive military strategies.\n\nIn some cases, cruise missiles are powered by nuclear reactors, which provide them with the necessary propulsion to travel long distances without the need for frequent refueling. This feature extends their operational range and allows for greater flexibility in deployment. However, the presence of nuclear propulsion also raises significant concerns regarding safety, security, and the potential for catastrophic consequences in the event of a malfunction or misuse.\n\nOverall, cruise missiles represent a sophisticated blend of technology and military strategy, reflecting the evolving nature of warfare and the ongoing emphasis on precision and efficiency in military operations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 403, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
