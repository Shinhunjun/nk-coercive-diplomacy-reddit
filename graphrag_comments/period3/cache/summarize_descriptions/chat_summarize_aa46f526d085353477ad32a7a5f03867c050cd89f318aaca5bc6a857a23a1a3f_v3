This group emerged as a significant political force, advocating for social justice and reform in Nicaragua. Their rise to prominence was marked by a strong resistance against the policies and actions of the U.S. government, which sought to undermine their influence and support counter-revolutionary forces in the region. The Sandinistas' ideology is rooted in Marxist principles, and they have historically championed the rights of the working class and marginalized communities in Nicaragua. Their opposition to U.S. intervention was a defining characteristic of their political struggle during this tumultuous period in Nicaraguan history.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 147, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 340, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
