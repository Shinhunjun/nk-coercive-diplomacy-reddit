Throughout Trump's presidency, he engaged in direct diplomatic efforts with KJU, which included notable summits aimed at achieving denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThese diplomatic interactions were characterized by a complex relationship, as Trump often made statements that appeared to defend Kim Jong-un, suggesting a level of personal rapport that was unusual for leaders of their respective nations. This dynamic contributed to a unique approach to international relations, where traditional diplomatic norms were sometimes set aside in favor of personal diplomacy.\n\nTrump's administration actively participated in negotiations with KJU, seeking to address the challenges posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions. The efforts included a series of meetings and discussions that aimed to reduce tensions and foster a more stable geopolitical environment in East Asia. Despite the challenges and setbacks that arose during these negotiations, the engagement between Trump and KJU marked a significant shift in U.S.-North Korea relations, moving from a period of heightened hostility to one where dialogue was prioritized.\n\nOverall, the interactions between Trump and KJU reflect a multifaceted relationship that encompassed both strategic interests and personal diplomacy, highlighting the complexities of international relations in the context of nuclear proliferation and regional security.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 272, "prompt_tokens": 227, "total_tokens": 499, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
