They have a distinct cultural identity and language, and they have historically faced various military actions and political challenges. The Kurds have been notably involved in conflicts, particularly in their struggle against the Islamic State (ISIS), during which they received support from the United States. This support has been crucial in their efforts to combat ISIS and establish a degree of autonomy in the regions they inhabit.\n\nIn addition to their fight against ISIS, the Kurds have also encountered ongoing tensions with neighboring countries, particularly Turkey and Russia. These tensions stem from the Kurds' aspirations for greater political autonomy and recognition, which have often been met with resistance from these nations. Turkey, in particular, has been concerned about the Kurdish movements within its borders and has conducted military operations against Kurdish groups it considers to be terrorist organizations.\n\nOverall, the Kurds represent a resilient ethnic group that continues to navigate complex geopolitical landscapes, striving for recognition and rights while facing significant challenges from both regional powers and ongoing conflicts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 214, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 417, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
