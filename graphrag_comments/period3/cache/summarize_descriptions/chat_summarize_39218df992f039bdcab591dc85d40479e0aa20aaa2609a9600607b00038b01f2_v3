The GBI is specifically designed to intercept and destroy incoming ballistic missiles during their midcourse phase of flight. This system comprises two main components: a booster and a kill vehicle. The booster is responsible for propelling the interceptor into the atmosphere, while the kill vehicle is tasked with locating and colliding with the target missile to neutralize the threat.\n\nAs a key element of the U.S. missile defense system, the GBI plays a vital role in safeguarding the nation against potential missile attacks. Its development and deployment are part of a broader strategy to enhance national security and provide a defensive capability against various missile threats. The GBI's operational effectiveness relies on advanced technology and precise targeting systems to ensure successful interception of hostile projectiles.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 182, "prompt_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 376, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
