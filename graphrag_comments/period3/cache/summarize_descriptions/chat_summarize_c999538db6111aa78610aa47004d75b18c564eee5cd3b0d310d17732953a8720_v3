His presidency was marked by a focus on negotiations with various global entities, notably North Korea and the Taliban. Trump's approach to foreign policy often reflected his personal style, which included direct engagement and a willingness to break from traditional diplomatic norms.\n\nDuring his tenure, Trump represented the U.S. in high-stakes international negotiations, particularly with North Korea, where he sought to address nuclear disarmament and reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula. His meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un were unprecedented for a sitting U.S. president and aimed at fostering dialogue and potential peace agreements.\n\nAdditionally, Trump's dealings with the Taliban were part of a broader strategy to end the long-standing conflict in Afghanistan. His administration initiated talks with the Taliban, which culminated in a framework for peace and the eventual withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region. These actions were often viewed as emblematic of his administration's foreign policy, which prioritized direct negotiation over multilateral agreements.\n\nOverall, Trump's presidency is frequently seen as a reflection of U.S. foreign policy during his time in office, characterized by a mix of assertive diplomacy and a departure from established practices. His legacy in international relations continues to be a subject of discussion and analysis, particularly regarding its long-term implications for U.S. standing in the world.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 285, "prompt_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 491, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
