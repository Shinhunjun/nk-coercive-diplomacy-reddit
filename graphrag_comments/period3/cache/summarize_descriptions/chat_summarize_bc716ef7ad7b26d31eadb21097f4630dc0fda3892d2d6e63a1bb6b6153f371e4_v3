He was detained by North Korea, where he reportedly suffered severe mistreatment and torture. This harsh treatment ultimately led to his death shortly after his release in June 2017, when he was returned to the United States in a comatose state. His case drew significant international condemnation and highlighted the broader issues surrounding North Korea's treatment of American and other foreign nationals in custody. The circumstances of Warmbier's detention and subsequent death sparked outrage and intensified scrutiny of North Korea's human rights record, particularly regarding its treatment of detainees.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 133, "prompt_tokens": 270, "total_tokens": 403, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
