Under his regime, the country has faced significant restrictions aimed at curtailing its nuclear capabilities and limiting its access to essential resources. These sanctions, primarily enforced by the United States and other nations, are designed to pressure Kim's government into compliance with international norms regarding nuclear proliferation. As a result, Kim Jong Un's decisions and policies are directly influenced by the constraints imposed by these sanctions, which seek to diminish the regime's ability to develop and maintain its nuclear arsenal. The ongoing sanctions reflect the international community's response to North Korea's actions under Kim's leadership, highlighting the complex interplay between his governance and global diplomatic efforts to promote stability and security in the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 353, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
