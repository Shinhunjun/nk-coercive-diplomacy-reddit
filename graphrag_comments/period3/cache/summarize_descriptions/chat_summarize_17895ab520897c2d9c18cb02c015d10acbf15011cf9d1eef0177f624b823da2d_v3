His administration's primary objective with these sanctions was to curb the nuclear ambitions of North Korea, which he announced as a significant part of his strategy. The sanctions were designed to exert economic pressure on these nations to deter their aggressive policies and nuclear development programs.\n\nIn addition to North Korea, Trump's administration also focused on Iran, where sanctions were a critical tool in addressing concerns over its nuclear program and regional activities. The sanctions against Iran were part of a broader strategy to limit its influence in the Middle East and to ensure compliance with international norms regarding nuclear proliferation.\n\nOverall, Donald Trump's approach to sanctions was characterized by a willingness to use economic measures as a means of achieving foreign policy goals, reflecting a more confrontational stance towards nations perceived as threats to U.S. interests and global security.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 183, "prompt_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 387, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
