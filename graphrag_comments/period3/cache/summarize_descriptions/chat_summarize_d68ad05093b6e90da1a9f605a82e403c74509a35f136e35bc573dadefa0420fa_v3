This approach is primarily associated with the United States and has been a significant aspect of its defense policy, particularly during the Cold War and in its dealings with nations such as North Korea. The core principle of nuclear deterrence is that the potential for devastating retaliatory strikes will dissuade adversaries from initiating conflict, as the consequences of such actions would be catastrophic.\n\nHistorically, the United States has employed nuclear deterrence as a means to maintain strategic stability and prevent the escalation of conflicts. The strategy relies on the credible threat of retaliatory nuclear strikes, which serves to create a balance of power and discourage hostile actions from other states. This has been particularly relevant in the context of US relations with North Korea, where the latter's nuclear ambitions have raised concerns about regional and global security.\n\nIn summary, nuclear deterrence is a critical military strategy that leverages the threat of nuclear retaliation to prevent aggression, with significant historical applications by the United States and implications in its interactions with nations like North Korea.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 217, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 417, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
