This rivalry shapes the foreign policy decisions of the US, as it perceives China as a strategic competitor. The competition encompasses various domains, including economic, military, and technological spheres, leading to a complex interplay of cooperation and conflict between the two nations.\n\nThe US's perspective on China as a strategic competitor influences its approach to regional and global issues, prompting a reevaluation of alliances and partnerships.
