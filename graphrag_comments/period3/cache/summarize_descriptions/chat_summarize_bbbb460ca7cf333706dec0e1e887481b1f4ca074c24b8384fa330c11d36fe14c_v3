This ongoing tension has been a significant aspect of the geopolitical landscape in East Asia, with North Korea's military posturing and nuclear ambitions contributing to the instability in the region. The absence of a formal peace treaty has perpetuated a state of conflict not only between North Korea and South Korea but also between North Korea and the United States. \n\nHistorically, the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty, leaving the Korean Peninsula technically still at war. This unresolved status has led to a series of confrontations and diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving a lasting peace. The lack of a peace treaty has implications for security dynamics in the region, as it allows for continued military readiness and hostilities.\n\nEfforts to negotiate a peace treaty have been complicated by various factors, including North Korea's nuclear weapons program and its relationships with other nations. The discussions are often influenced by the broader context of international relations, particularly the role of the United States as a key player in the region. The ongoing conflict and the absence of a peace treaty highlight the complexities of achieving stability and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula. \n\nIn summary, the peace treaty discussions are central to understanding the conflict involving North Korea, South Korea, and the United States, reflecting the intricate web of historical grievances, military tensions, and diplomatic challenges that characterize this critical geopolitical issue.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 299, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 488, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
