This development is aimed at enhancing the country's military capabilities and strengthening its deterrence posture against perceived threats, particularly from the United States and its allies. The successful testing of these ICBMs has demonstrated North Korea's advancements in missile technology, raising significant concerns regarding global security.\n\nThe ongoing development and testing of ICBMs by North Korea are viewed as a direct challenge to international stability, as these weapons have the potential to reach targets far beyond the Korean Peninsula. The North Korean regime considers its ICBM program essential for maintaining its sovereignty and deterring foreign intervention. As such, the focus on ICBMs reflects a broader military strategy that prioritizes the enhancement of its defense capabilities in the face of external pressures.\n\nOverall, North Korea's commitment to developing ICBMs underscores the regime's intent to solidify its military strength and assert its position on the global stage, which continues to be a source of concern for the international community.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 264, "total_tokens": 476, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
