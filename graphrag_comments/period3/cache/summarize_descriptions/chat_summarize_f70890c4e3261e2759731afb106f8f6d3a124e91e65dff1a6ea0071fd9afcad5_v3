During his presidency, he facilitated a notable arms deal to the kingdom, which underscored the strategic partnership between the two entities. Trump's administration often highlighted the importance of this relationship, focusing on mutual interests in defense and economic cooperation.\n\nDespite the benefits of this alliance, Trump faced criticism for his close ties with Saudi Arabia, particularly regarding the kingdom's human rights record. Critics pointed out that he frequently defended Saudi actions, even in the face of serious human rights concerns, and often portrayed the country's authoritarian governance in a favorable light. This approach raised questions about the ethical implications of prioritizing economic and military interests over human rights considerations.\n\nOverall, Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia reflects a complex interplay of strategic partnership and contentious ethical issues, as he navigated the balance between fostering strong ties and addressing the criticisms surrounding the kingdom's governance and human rights practices.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 189, "prompt_tokens": 258, "total_tokens": 447, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
