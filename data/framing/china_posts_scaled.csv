>The hacking campaign, known as “Cloud Hopper,” was the subject of a U.S. indictment in December that accused two Chinese nationals of identity theft and fraud. Prosecutors described an elaborate operation that victimized multiple Western companies but stopped short of naming them. A Reuters report at the time identified two: Hewlett Packard Enterprise and IBM.  
>  
>Yet the campaign ensnared at least six more major technology firms, touching five of the world’s 10 biggest tech service providers.

&#x200B;

>Also compromised by Cloud Hopper, Reuters has found: Fujitsu, Tata Consultancy Services, NTT Data, Dimension Data, Computer Sciences Corporation and DXC Technology. HPE spun-off its services arm in a merger with Computer Sciences Corporation in 2017 to create DXC.  
>  
>Waves of hacking victims emanate from those six plus HPE and IBM: their clients. Ericsson, which competes with Chinese firms in the strategically critical mobile telecoms business, is one. Others include travel reservation system Sabre, the American leader in managing plane bookings, and the largest shipbuilder for the U.S. Navy, Huntington Ingalls Industries, which builds America’s nuclear submarines at a Virginia shipyard.

c4rjeg,"Why is the US more concerned about a Middle East hegemon and WMDs than Europe, Russia and China?","Why is the US more concerned about a Middle East hegemon and WMDs than Europe, Russia and China?

&#x200B;

Throughout the Cold War the US has relied on the Middle East for secure oil supplies in case of a war with the Soviet Union. The US feared the Soviets or another Middle East power such as Nasser's Arab Republic taking over and the US could no longer effectively fuel their tanks and aircraft in an arms race. The US allied with Saudi Arabia, a rather non-nationalistic, non-populist state, that would provide them oil, and the US would provide them security. US also allied with Israel by the time of the 1970s, since Israel was an effective buffer against Arab states and provided intelligence on both regional threats and terrorists.

Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the conventional large scale military threat was gone. However on 9/11, the US got a taste that history was not over and the new century has come. The US feared that terrorists would take control of Saudi Arabia and other Arab states and also feared they would get WMDs, ie. the invasion if Iraq and Afghanistan.

However, by the time of 2014, the shale revolution had begun and the US no longer relied on oil from the Middle East. China and Europe still relied on the Middle East for oil supplies. However, it seems like the US is still the most involved in the Middle East, why is this? Also the US is really concerned about WMDs still, why is this?

The theory if Iran did control the Middle East, a Russian-Iran block will be formed. Also Europe could get its oil supplies from Africa and China from Russia. US propting up Saudi Arabia is a good way to keep China and Europe in check in theory.

The first theory makes more sense. Historically, the US has always represented the anti-nationalist pro-globalization force, while Russia has been a the nationalist force, the US being very capital rich and suited for global trade while the colder more isolated Russia has been less open. US props up capital rich proxies while Russia props up nationalist ones. Saudi Arabia is an unstable state by design and it is very reliant on the United States for trade and security. A nationalist state in the Middle East like Iran would always back a state like Russia. Russia would provide Iran with weapons and security while Iran would join Russia's sphere of influence. China would have no choice but to side with the this new Eurasian alliance, them being a vital trading partner and a supplier of oil.",Mrbsct,geopolitics,24,31,1561395983,/r/geopolitics/comments/c4rjeg/why_is_the_us_more_concerned_about_a_middle_east/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/c4rjeg/why_is_the_us_more_concerned_about_a_middle_east/,china,2025-12-08 10:57:24,,2025-12-09 00:21:35,THREAT,0.9,"The post discusses concerns about a Middle East hegemon and weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), indicating a focus on military threats.",-2.0

btgmzt,How can the US Industrial Base compete with China's? (Looking at the navy and ground forces in particular),"If there is an arms race in the future, how can the US manage to sustain industrial production on par with China. They have a huge head start in current military stock and their aerospace industry has far higher production capacity than China's so they will have more military aircraft deliveries but the same can't be said for the naval and ground forces. China's industrial capacity is far, far larger than America's, in fact it is comparable to the rest of the world.

&#x200B;

|Industry|Year|China|US|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Steel Production (million metric tons)|2018|928.3|86.7|
|Primary aluminium production (thousands of metric tons)|2017|32,600|740|

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The US has a clear cut advantage in aircraft production and looks to hold that supremacy for quite some time.

The United States, given its large appetite for trade, has surprisingly diverse trade partners. 5 nations make up around 50% of the trade volume, yet only 1 of them are even tested as being non-ally. And Mexicos increasing GDP, natural resource mining, Oil and gas has made this large and popular nation ripe for a middle power position in world economic terms. Given that North America is a hub of mostly big, resource full, populous 500 million people based region- will the United States look more closer to home for trade and such rather than cross the Pacific in the future?

bspbvl,Did China overlook ideological differences? The democratic world is teaming up on the CCP,"I was very skeptical of Trump, that China will come out on top of this trade war, with Europe and Canada being more pro-China. However it doesn't seem like the case. Both US and China are suffering from trade war but I do believe China is suffering more. My Chinese stocks are going down and I sold them all. The problem is China is simply too reliant on foreign markets in order to function effectively.

&#x200B;

Despite the desire for free trade, it seems like the EU and Canada and Australia and being pro-US despite it not benefiting their economies. A good example is the Canadian ban on Huawei, it will help the Canadian tech industry a lot, the security of alliance with US trumps it. Australian politicians are growing more and more worried about China despite it being such a large partner with China.

If you have been watching comments by Steve Bannon, this is purely ideological not diplomatic. Men like Bannon hate the fact China is a command economy and rising. China is not a huge threat on American security, but a threat on the American identity *of what nation should be* and democracies from Japan to Germany are supporting America on this.

This is not a ""raw raw China bad"" post but it shows a alternative-realist perspective where it is not only about economics, but a fight for identity and cultural power. US is at a point where it doesn't need Mid-East oil, it has automation to replace foreign workers and factories, and has a fairly self-sufficient tech industry.

b9taty,Presence of Chinese vessels around Pag-asa Island 'illegal',"Over 600 Chinese vessels have been circling Pag-asa Island since January this year, the military said. 

Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo on Monday said Manila has already filed a diplomatic protest on the incursions. He did not provide more details. 

China has ramped up island building and militarization activities in the  South China Sea, shunning a July 2016 ruling of a United Nations-backed arbitral tribunal that invalidated its nine-dash line claim over nearly  all of the waters.

**Comments / significance:**

* *China does not recognize Philippine claims and cites how Chinese vessels have fished in the area for over a hundred years.*
* *The use of 100's of Chinese fishing boats clogs up fishing waters for Philippines.  China can place these fishing vessels under Chinese Navy control in times of war or crisis.*
* *The USS Wasp, amphibious assault ship, arrived in Philippines March 30 with at least 10 F-35B's.*

b2quz3,Some thoughts on the evolving pro-Chinese presence in this subreddit [Meta],"By now I'm sure quite a few of us have read the Buzzfeed News article about Reddit and this subreddit in particular being a place where discourse has been increasingly ""pro-Chinese"". I've been part of this subreddit for about 3 years now, and for better or worse my area of interest (being Chinese geopolitics and China related military development) and my activity on this subreddit has given me some slight profile, where I now feel obliged to discuss this elephant in the room. I've contacted /u/dieyoufool3 regarding this post and he's given me the nod to make it. I don't want to step on the mod team's toes and I think they've done a good job of running the subreddit overall to allow a variety of different arguments compete and be reviewed on the basis of the logic and merit of the arguments themselves. This may end up being a bit of a long textpost, so I apologize for that.

*Edit: seeing as I'm receiving a few comments about this -- I do not necessarily endorse or agree with the contents of the full Buzzfeed News article. However I do think it is a useful springboard for talking about what some people in this subreddit and on Reddit overall have been complaining about. To make it clear, the extent of my opinion is that this subreddit is technically more ""pro-China"" i.e.: less ""anti-China"" than the rest of Reddit tends to be. I lay this out in one of the paragraphs in point 1, however I want to put it clearly out here so no one misses it.*

======

This subreddit is a public space where competing ideas exist, but that nature means it is possible for third parties to try and artificially alter the route and form of the community's discussion and debate without participating it in good faith or without constructively contributing. I see three main challenges for the mod team here (but also indeed for any subreddit or community):

1. Intent of the user
2. Boundaries of discourse
3. Brigading and vote manipulation

I've been ruminating about this China specific issue on this subreddit for a while now. Part of the reason is because I have definitely noticed this subreddit has having a larger amount of individuals who are ""pro-Chinese"" than most average/default subreddits on Reddit. Another part of the reason is because I myself have been accused of being a propagandist, a wumao, a shill or a troll in the past as well. I'm aware of at least one individual who has even followed me on this account and created a subreddit to commentate and mock my activity. So I think now is a good time to start talking about the China discourse here openly. To start off;

&#x200B;

**1, Intent of the user:**

* This refers to whether a user on the subreddit is a real person who is part of this ""community"" and is interested in constructively contributing to it, rather than someone ""outside"" of the community, such as bots (which are obviously not people) or foreign ""shills"" (where their posts and contributions are a result of being paid or incentivized to post things they themselves may not believe in). Obviously for any community, the desire is to only have real people who are interested in having a genuine discussion.
* I imagine the mod team may have some resources to be able to identify which users are bots and/or replica accounts. I'm not sure if this may include IP identification or if it is more primitive like simply checking the history of the user (e.g.: many low effort contributions from day old accounts).
* Unfortunately, I think it's much more difficult to identify ""shills"" because it is impossible to identify an individual who is being paid to post about a particular belief or argument versus an individual who does genuinely believe about said belief or argument. Some people may suggest one way of tracking such individuals is by looking through their history, and if their post and comment history only revolves around discussing a particular set of topics, it may be a useful indicator to identify a ""shill"". On first glance that is not illogical, however I also think there are more than a few people who have used dedicated accounts to talk about these issues because they are interested in it -- in fact this particular account I've been using for the last few years is one I deliberately created to only talk about China related geopolitics and PLA developments, because my main Reddit account is one I use to browse other lighter, less intense topics (obviously I leave the two accounts well segregated). My main Reddit account also has some comments where it may be possible for me to be doxxed, and I'm sure I don't need to explain my caution around how some of my posts or comments may be received by some individuals who could end up being genuinely hostile.
* It is very easy to call someone you disagree with a shill, or a troll, a bot or a wumao or a propagandist, or brainwashed. I avoid doing so, because when that card is pulled, it is essentially the equivalent of forfeiting the argument as well as suggesting that the other person across the screen you are debating with is not a genuine person with genuine opinions. In a place where the purpose is to have constructive discussion, dismissing a person's belief in their opinion as fabricated is among the most egregious and low effort statements one can make.
* Finally, I feel obliged to speculate about the noted higher prevalence of ""pro-Chinese"" users on this subreddit versus the rest of the website (though I certainly don't think that group of users is anywhere near a majority of the 140k people here). People have understandably been concerned if this subreddit might be targeted by Chinese govt influence groups. Based on my time in the subreddit as well as based on a few people who have contacted me in the past, I hypothesize the higher prevalence of ""pro-Chinese"" users here is a reflection of greater interest in ""geopolitical"" matters from the overseas Chinese community in contemporary times compared to the past.
* Some people may have guessed this in the past, but I do have Chinese heritage in me (I won't disclose if it's part, half or whole), and as someone living in a ""western nation"" I have of course observed the way in which news media and commentary have written about China within the last decade or more (often in a context of power trajectory and/or geopolitics). That environment that in turn has led me to be interested in China related geopolitics. I obviously do not speak for all individuals with Chinese heritage, but I've been contacted by a few on this account who have described a similar trajectory of interest. In short, I wonder if Chinese individuals of a certain era living in the English speaking world may be on average more interested in geopolitics than other demographic groups on average -- and on Reddit the cross section of that means there may be a higher proportion of /r/geopolitics users of a Chinese background than elsewhere on Reddit, relatively speaking. However this is merely a hypothesis and not any sort of watertight argument. It is also very possible that this subreddit do not have a greater proportion individuals of a Chinese background than the rest of Reddit, but it merely attracts individuals who have a certain way of thinking or a worldview that causes this subreddit to seem more pro-Chinese than the rest of Reddit.

&#x200B;

**2, Boundaries of discourse**

* The moderators are free to choose what the boundaries of discussion are on this subreddit, which I think is an authority we do respect. The complex problem that is posed to them, is where to set those boundaries.
* Obviously everyone would agree that things like advocating for violence or genocide or denying the occurrence of historical atrocities would very much be beyond the pale. Similarly, posts including offensive language and personal attacks are also not appropriate for a subreddit with standards.
* But there are obviously many other topics were a range of opinions exist and consensus does not exist. For China related topics (given the focus of this post), this may include interpretations of the Tiananmen protests in 1989, to the legitimacy of the CCP and the Chinese govt, to the nature of the Chinese economy, as well as some more recent heated issues like Chinese re-education efforts in Xinjiang and the social credit system in the country. On the larger scale, topics of debate like the nature of the international legal order, the balance of power of the UN, the fairness of international financial institutions, are various other contentious topics we've seen debated here.
* Individuals of differing backgrounds will have differing opinions about a range of topics. Our opinions and worldviews are a reflection of the way we were socialized by family, friends, media, history and education. To my understanding, I believe this subreddit is open to having opinions from a range of different backgrounds contribute so long as they remain within clear boundaries. I do not believe this subreddit is an ""echo chamber"" that only exclusively pushes a single nation or group's views on all issues. In my opinion this is a good thing, because to have proper discussion about geopolitics one cannot merely only hear what you yourself believe but also what to hear what other groups believe. I myself have learned a lot from a number of users in this subreddit from different backgrounds, including people whose opinions I initially may have disagreed with.
* However, I also appreciate that sometimes merely allowing the debate of certain topics leads to the normalization of certain discourses. Something that was previously seen as completely indefensible may, after some debate, be seen as perhaps not entirely unreasonable under a certain set of circumstances.
* Wherever the moderators choose to set the boundaries either now or in the future, it is an unenviable task.

&#x200B;

**3, Brigading and vote manipulation**

* We all know what brigading and vote manipulation means. I'm not sure if other places have ever coordinated to deliberately manipulate votes or alter contributions or comments here. If so, that is obviously undesirable. I'm not sure how easy it is for the moderators to track this behaviour, but it is somewhat related to the issues of user intent from point 1.
* The infamous case of Unidan also showed us how easy it is for a few alt accounts to alter the vote trajectory of certain comments and to make them obscure. As a matter of principle I do not downvote comments that I disagree with or comments that I am engaged in a debate with. However receiving downvoting due to genuine individuals who disagree with a particular comment also happens, and I imagine it is difficult to distinguish that versus coordinated vote manipulation.
* The votes of a post or comment tend to be perceived as reflecting the amount of support it has. This is inherently tied to whether the contributing upvotes or downvotes to a certain post is a reflection of outside vote manipulation or if it a reflection of the actual demographics of the genuine user base. Hypothetically, if there was a way to determine that the votes of a comment or post are the result of the genuine user base, then the question to be asked is how comfortable the moderator team is in having that proportion of their user base holding those views -- i.e.: tying back to point 2.

=====

Given this subreddit is meant to talk about geopolitics, it is almost impossible to talk about geopolitics without occasionally talking about China related geopolitical events. Naturally there will be debate that follows.

I appreciate that a good portion of this subreddit's userbase likely resides in the western, English speaking world (with a higher proportion from that demographic as part of Reddit's overall userbase). It is likely that many of the arguments made from users of a Chinese background, seem alien and perhaps even outrageous to the extent that they are perceived as being made from professional propagandists. I have no solution for those kind of concerns, and it is up to the moderator team or even Reddit admin to consider how much range of debate this subreddit should have for the complex and international topic that is geopolitics (not only China related topics but all topics in future).

But personally, in my time here I've found this subreddit to overwhelmingly be a place of genuine debate about genuine ideas from genuine people. I do my best to contribute constructively and to use language that is not overly emotive, and I think many people here do so as well. I hope this subreddit can remain so in the future.",PLArealtalk,geopolitics,524,310,1552957730,/r/geopolitics/comments/b2quz3/some_thoughts_on_the_evolving_prochinese_presence/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/b2quz3/some_thoughts_on_the_evolving_prochinese_presence/,china,2025-12-08 10:57:24,,2025-12-09 00:21:35,NEUTRAL,0.8,"The post discusses the presence of pro-Chinese discourse in a subreddit without explicitly addressing threats, diplomacy, economic issues, or humanitarian concerns.

a8luiz,What do you think of Acemoglu and Robinson's argument that Chinese prosperity will reach a plateau due to a lack of progress in developing inclusive economic and political institutions?,"In their book ""Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity and Poverty"", economists Daron Acemoglu and James A Robinson explore the role of institutions in poverty and wealth. Towards the end, they comment on the case of China, where there has been unprecedented economic growth since the 1990s in spite of the Communist Party maintaining large degrees of control over the Chinese economy.

The pair argue that despite making huge strides towards inclusive economic institutions since Deng Xiaoping's reforms, China's economic growth is ""an example of growth under extractive political institutions"". As China's development level catches up to that of western countries, entrepreneurs must be given more room to ply their trade and take advantage of opportunities without being afraid of what the CCP may think. Otherwise the Chinese economy will stagnate and struggle to be competitive.

To put it simply (in their words): ""China has achieved economic growth not thanks to its extractive political institutions, but despite them"". While Deng Xiaoping's reform played a vital role in facilitating this growth, there will come a time in the future when China is faced with the option of political liberalisation or economic stagnation.

I'd be interested to get your thoughts on this matter. To what extent are Chinese leaders willing to tolerate further liberalisation? Is there a balancing act to be played between economic prosperity and security? Is liberalisation even necessary for China to continue its ascent on the world stage?",One--Among--Many,geopolitics,41,40,1545494125,/r/geopolitics/comments/a8luiz/what_do_you_think_of_acemoglu_and_robinsons/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/a8luiz/what_do_you_think_of_acemoglu_and_robinsons/,china,2025-12-08 10:57:24,,2025-12-09 00:21:35,ECONOMIC,0.85,"The post discusses economic growth and the implications of economic institutions in China, which aligns with economic framing.",0.0

9yfn35,IP theft is a common issue in a historical perspective and not just an issue of the Chinese government,"Chinese IP theft isn't an isolated issue, when IP theft is basically done by all capable powers. I remember the time when Japanese companies were known for the activities of copy and stealing IP from the west. Japanese visitors became fake products presented which they made pictures off. Japanese cars in the 1960s and 1970s imitated American design language. Looking even further into history it was Germany before WW1 who copied British products, which made the parliament in London enforcing a **Made in xxx** label on products. The copied products from Germany were cheaper and had at least a comparable quality, which made **Made in Germany** popular. The Netherlands introduced an law for patents as late as in 1912. 

But of course history is developing and the US was accused of stealing IP via CIA and it's stations in NATO countries. At that time it was easy since all communication was done over analog lines or ISDN. [The case Enercon is an good example](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.deutschlandfunk.de%2Fvorsicht-freund-hoert-mit.724.de.html%3Fdram%3Aarticle_id%3D97135&edit-text=&act=url) / [Source](https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/vorsicht-freund-hoert-mit.724.de.html?dram:article_id=97135). But of course it would be quite a lie, when the Germans were painted as innocent. [The German BND spied on Austrian companies for 20 years](https://derstandard.at/2000081647150/Die-Liste-Wen-der-deutsche-Geheimdienst-in-Oesterreich-ausspaehte)

Especially the collaboration of NATO intelligence services to fill gaps of knowledge and circumvent domestic laws was an issue for every domestic industry. The collection of meta data was opening the doors into the local networks. Another attack vector is of course the lack of multiple vendors for operative systems and network technology. Even when Chinese companies like Huawei under a suspicion, Cisco had in the last years so many problems with vulnerabilities and backdoors, that using such a product can be considered as careless. 

We must conclude that IP theft is wide spread and is not just done by China. The accusation of China as the evil is making blind for a solution of such a problem. It's obvious when governments are active supporting IP theft more laws don't help. And the IP theft by non governmental actors like companies is not negligible at all. The protection by laws will not work, when the incentive is that high. Even when a company is getting sanctioned and will declare bankruptcy the knowledge will be sold. Sanctions don't help either when they remove a market for the domestic industry. The development of laws for the protection of IP in various countries was made in most cases when the domestic industry was fully developed and had an advantage on some fields. 

The history about IP protection raises the question to which degree IP protection is outdated, when protection becomes quite expensive. The dream every country has to follow international treaties or will be punished can't be achieved. Companies are often careless, because of the cost of protection. We don't have even a network device certification. It's the reason why China has it's own Linux distribution and China has it's own network device vendors. This is a strategic advantage. The opportunity cost of software is quite a factor which prevents a landscape of competitors offering products focused on security. 

What's left is IMHO just the conclusion a country has to support innovation on all fronts as a long term strategy. Education in school, companies and university are key factors to prevent a decline. The collaboration of government and companies for the education of blue collar workers is extreme important to close the gap between academia and practical experience. Just pushing academics into the companies doesn't work.  The treatment of employees only as a human resource isn't a solution since it doesn't create respect and loyalty. The latter is a factor against IP theft.

9xit1p,Could the US reciprocate Chinese and Russian information warfare? How effectively?,"Obviously there's a fair bit of talk these days about information warfare in the US. Donald Trump's Twitter is full of references to ""fake news"" and Democrats often accuse Russian hackers and troll farms of exercising undue influence on American domestic politics. What the exact effects of information warfare are on the US seem to be anybody's guess, but I think it's fair to say that foreign attempts to spread misinformation and propaganda have probably had some detrimental effect on US national unity and the political beliefs of its citizens.

So, anyways, I'm taking the bus home from work today and I'm wondering - why hasn't the US attempted to wage any similar sort of information warfare against its geopolitical rivals? Or, if it has, why haven't I heard anything about it? I mean, I assume that if Russia can stoke political unrest in the US by employing kids to run Twitter bot farms, the US can do something similar on VK. A quick Google search, however, and the only thing I can find is something called Operation Earnest Voice, which sounds like it's more targeted at Islamic extremists than foreign powers. I know that the US’s main geopolitical rivals – Russia, China, and Iran – are all censoring and various degrees of nondemocratic, but I still imagine that using Internet social media networks to play up corruption scandals or spread fake news about - I dunno - Xi Jinping’s sex life could still do a fair bit to weaken their state apparatuses. And surely the US could find a way to get a message out if it really wanted to.

I guess that even if the US government were able to do something like this, they’d still have to want to do it. First, I’m not sure how the US public would look upon the government screwing around in the domestic politics of foreign powers– it’d obviously be rather hypocritical for the US to be engaging in information warfare right in the wake of the Russia-meddled-in-our-elections accusations. Second, I perceive the US’s main goals with regards to China and Russia (at least) to be more containment than outright destabilization. Still, from a geopolitical perspective at least, it makes sense to me for the US to attempt to weaken its foreign rivals using information warfare, especially when it would probably be pretty cheap to do and when other countries have shown no qualms about using the strategy. 

So I guess I have two questions. First, to what extent is the US engaging in information warfare with foreign powers? Second, if the US were to vigorously engage in an information warfare campaign against its geopolitical rivals, what would the likely results be? Would the US benefit?",C4rlos_D4nger,geopolitics,31,35,1542342083,/r/geopolitics/comments/9xit1p/could_the_us_reciprocate_chinese_and_russian/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/9xit1p/could_the_us_reciprocate_chinese_and_russian/,china,2025-12-08 10:57:24,,2025-12-09 00:21:35,THREAT,0.8,"The post discusses the implications of foreign information warfare on US national security, suggesting a concern over external influences that could be perceived as a threat.",-2.0

7a36o0,"If the Russian Federation would propose its Far East region for sale to the People’s Republic of China for $500 billion, would Beijing accept Kremlin's offer?","Sorry for my English, please.

Details of my request:

I'm not speaking about the probability of such proposition by Russian. I do understands, this probability is somewhere very-very near 0%. What I am asking for and interested in, is **the Chinese government reaction on it.**

Russian Far East the name of historical region, terrestrially almost identical to the current administrative division called [Far Eastern Federal District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Eastern_Federal_District). 

You also can look at the [Russian Far East map](https://i.imgur.com/Op6cxak.jpg).
Population: around 6 million people, or 4% of Russian total population.
Area: around 6,200,000 square kilometers, or 36% of total Russian area.

Assume that Russian proposition include such unconditional provisions:

- $500 billion, direct compensation to Russian government;
- immediate Chinese citizenship to every resident of Far East region, if such resident claims his/her will to receive Chinese citizenship;
- $100 thousand given to every person who wish to relocate to Russian proper territories and would reject Chinese citizenship + compensation for property and untransferable assets at the full market prices of year before;
- $20 thousand given to every person who wish to stay in Far East region, receive immediate Chinese citizenship and renounce the Russian citizenship, after Chinese authorities receive proof of such renunciation;
- 10 years citizenry deferral period, during which residents of Far East region are allowed to hold two citizenship's (however, not receiving any transition bonus/compensation mentioned above). After 10 years governments of China and Russia are allowed to denounce citizenship of non-resident dual citizens;
- every Chinese citizen, who was Russian citizen and legal resident of Far Eastern Federal District at the moment of sovereignty transition, would be provided with social protections at levels not below levels of the same year in Russia, with no time limits, forever: pensions, medical care, etc. (For example: government pension to certain category of retirees in China is lower than in Russia, then China will pay higher pension to its citizens of this categories, who were Russian citizens and FEDF residents at the time of transition);
- $150 billion would be payed for the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Navy and all military infrastructure of the region, excluding nuclear arsenal, which would be relocated to the Russian proper territory at Chinese expenses.

In total it bring us no less than $1 trillion.
But consider: territory of Russian Far East - 6,2 million square kilometers. Territory of China - 9,5 million square kilometer.

How do you think, would Chinese government agree or reject such offer?

Thanks.

I could tell you things about their character, their reputation, their background, motivations, etc.

&#x200B;

I would be at something of a loss, however, if asked to describe the *personality* of Xi Jinping. [This recent NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/world/asia/xi-jinping-china-leader.html) reflects my sentiment. What is he like, personally?

9ogizk,What is the average Chinese perception of Xi Jinping's Handling of the Trade War?,"As a Westerner, I find it difficult to attain a gauge of what most Chinese are feeling in regards to Xi and the Communist Party's response to the trade war with the United States. Considering the heavy censorship of the Chinese media and the fact that the country lies an ocean away from me makes it even harder to obtain accurate information. Some Chinese may be silenced and punished for broadcasting bad thoughts about Xi, yet we don't hear much from those who praise him as well. I think Xi's response to the trade war, in a sense, gives us an opportunity to see what many Chinese think about him and his authoritarian rule.

So for anyone who has any insight into all of this, do you think most Chinese agree with Xi's countermeasures to US tariffs? Do they feel confident in Xi's ability to stand up for China, to minimize the damage the tariffs may do while carrying through with his massive economic reforms? Do most Chinese think that this represents the opening salvo of a greater conflict with the United States, or do they think the trade issue will eventually be resolved? Are many Chinese worried about how the trade war may personally affect their work and living conditions? Do they think they're on the winning side?

651dym,Parsing Xi Jinping's comments on Korea to Trump,"In a recent interview with Fox News, Trump recounted something interesting about his conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping:

>TRUMP:  The first thing I brought up was North Korea.  I said you've got to help us with North Korea, because we can't allow it.  And it's not good for you.  And you have a tremendous power because of trade.

>**Now, he then explains thousands of years of history with Korea.**  Not that easy.  In other words, not as simple as people would think.

>**They've had tremendous conflict with Korea over the years.  Now, his father was in China four times.  He was never in China.**

First, it seems that Xi explained the history of China and the Korean peninsula, over many thousands of years. He may have done this to show the close relations China has had with Korea and to signal that this is a core interest of the PRC.

Secondly, Trump recounts the fact that China and Korea have been in conflict, during certain points in their history. Xi most likely told him of this, to show that China is not automatically aligned with North Korea and that they can have disagreements.

The most interesting tidbit is when Trump, in his typical vague fashion, says that Kim Jong-Un's father paid 4 state visits to China while his son has never done so. If this was a factoid Xi told him about, it may have been to show that China is not as warm to the current regime in Pyongyang than it used to be in the past. It could also just be a random fact told to Trump during a briefer.

Either way, it seems that the Chinese President's main goal was to remind the U.S. administration that this is not a two-sided conflict and that China is not so friendly to North Korea as most would think. This may have been done to soothe Trump's rhetoric about China not helping and temper his view that China enables North Korea's behaviour. 

**EDIT:** In today's WSJ interview, Trump said this:

>“After listening for 10 minutes, I realized it’s not so easy. ... I felt pretty strongly that they had a tremendous power” over North Korea, Trump told the Wall Street Journal. “But it’s not what you would think.” 

This only confirms my analysis: that Xi wanted to convince Trump that China does not have that much leverage of North Korea. It is also interesting that it is so easy to change Trump's mind on something. This is basic information - was he just pretending to not know it or did he actually not know?

6xofjg,Questions Concerning U.S. Strategy in the South China Sea,"Hey guys, I've been thinking about the South China Sea situation lately and would like input on a general question I have.       
           
That question is: Why doesn't the U.S. stop doing freedom of navigation exercises around disputed Chinese-claimed islands in the South China Sea?         
            
If the U.S. were to stop the patrols immediately but still maintain military alliances and perform some limited military drills with its allies in the region, it could potentially change the situation for the worst on China's behalf.        
         
Firstly, it is important to note that China is very determined to expand its aggressive posturing around and procurement of additional islands in the South China Sea, like in areas such as the Spratly islands. If the U.S. were to stop Freedom of Navigation exercises in the region, they would very likely expand unimpeded. This will likely result in more friction with other countries in the region which claim the same islands, as well as a strengthening of both military and economic ties among the ASEAN countries, who will probably also seek to exit China's sphere of influence and establish their own in order to counter it and take on the responsibility of restricting its expansion which America previously upheld. We might even see a domino effect happen where other countries which are also heavily dependent on oil and other imports which traverse through the South China Sea, such as India, may become more concerned that Freedom of Navigation isn't being enforced there. They may also seek to step in and address the situation, form and/or strengthen alliances in South East Asia, etc.        
          
Secondly, the international community will see this reaction as more justified since previous claims of any opposition from these countries as being ""U.S.-orchestrated"" (which is an allegation leveled by China at the recent Philippines vs. China U.N. ruling for example) will be even less credible since the U.S. won't be nearly as involved. We could see increased economic sanctions placed on China as a result of this.          
             
Perhaps what I really need is for people to re-iterate to me why the U.S. should be so aggressively protecting this region from something which could potentially end up working out in its favor.

6pc1al,An interesting ongoing debate on the US's South China Sea policy,"The Australian Lowy Institute, a think-tank that deals with international policy, has been hosting a debate on its publishing platform *The Interpreter* that I think is interesting. Well, it's hosted on multiple platforms, but *mainly* it's on *The Interpreter* now. I'll just give a basic rundown:

1) [Ely Ratner, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2017-06-13/course-correction), published a piece in *Foreign Affairs* arguing that the United States should take a tougher line on Chinese actions in the South China Sea. This, Ratner argues, involves abandoning the stated neutrality, and beginning to help defend countries against Chinese claims. This would involve things like helping set up military bases in the contested areas, enlisting other countries like Japan and Australia to assist, and making a commitment to protect other countries' claims.

2) [Hugh White, a professor at the Australian National University](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/south-china-sea-us-policy-must-begin-home), responded in *The Interpreter* by arguing against each point. He claimed that it's unlikely that Southeast Asian countries would allow US assistance to build bases, or that other countries like Australia or Japan would contribute, because it might be seen as too escalatory. He also says that it's unclear the US would commit to real military action (i.e. war), which means the credibility of the threat is nonexistent and the deterrence value would degrade if the US tried. And he caps it with saying that there's no way to push back on China without war, and as a result the US should focus on rebuilding credibility domestically so that US threats abroad will be taken seriously (in essence, a statement that Trump makes it impossible to convince other countries to do things).

3) [Ely Ratner responds](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/false-choice-war-or-accommodation-south-china-sea) in *The Interpreter*. He and White basically agree on the backdrop, but not on the results of actions. Ratner argues that allied support faces the obstacle of Chinese opposition, and states that this is why he proposes that first, an informational campaign to embarrass China and a path like TPP to wean states off of China with an alternative must be tried. Only after this, he says, can the rest of his proposals come through. He also says that war is not the only alternative to push back on China, saying that war is unlikely due to the many brakes on such an escalation, and saying Chinese hegemony is more likely to be a threat than any chance of going to war. He caps it off with a mention that China is essentially risk averse, saying that China is only pushing because it sees no real costs associated, and that he agrees with the notion that the US's domestic credibility needs to be enhanced.

4) [Hugh White responded](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/let-be-clear-china-would-call-america-s-bluff-south-china-sea) most recently, saying that China offers too good a deal to countries near it through things like the AIIB, and it is impossible to wean states off their influence. Second, he claims that China has history as a guide, and the US would back off at a Chinese challenge, or that China would at least think as much. And finally, he argues that the first step must be domestic, while Ratner argues domestic changes should be undergone at the same time as other actions.

At the end of the day, both sides make very interesting arguments, but I feel as though nearer to the end they were going in circles. I think Ratner has the better of the argument personally, by pointing out that domestic actions to shore up credibility can be done at the same time as actions abroad. The clear point is that credibility-building actions must also be done in a way that shows foreign countries resolve, not just the domestic public's resolve. Engagement with the world and with East Asia is critical to that, and China's takeover of East Asia, as White puts it, is still seen as a threat to many of the countries in the region. Unless that changes, those countries may be willing to go along with the US up at least some of the escalatory ladder, and if China goes along with the US, then those countries are more likely to see China as a hostile actor after all, which will only shore up US standing. But I do think that White has the better of the argument for the next three years, since at the end of the day, focusing domestically will only help so long as Trump is *not* in office, as I think his credibility is irreparably harmed. Even so, I think the general order of next steps is correct for Ratner's argument, while the timing of when they start is correct for White's.

6obj4k,Why is China seen as the aggressor in the South China Sea and the Philippines as the victim?,"The main contenders are really just Vietnam, Philippines, and the PRC, although other SEA countries do have stakes there, it is none to the degree of the three countries previously mentioned.  Taiwan is a special case and are actually taking China's stance (not supporting) since that the PRC essentially inherited the nine dash line from ROC.

Now that the intro (which I don't think is necessary) is out of the way,  the Philippines' claim could be dismantled by using historical evidence (not maps, but treaties between Japan, France, Spain, and America)

When the Spanish ceded the Philippines to America, the Spratly islands were not included (Philippines' main stake in the area).  Later, when the colonial province of Taiwan (Japan) took the Spratly islands, the American side did not react.  Per the Potsdam declaration and the San Francisco treaty, Taiwan was ceded back to ROC, which now resides in Taiwan.  Which means that even if there was a dispute for those islands, it should be between the two Chinas, not the Philippines.

So, why does the world see the Philippines as the victim when they have absolutely nothing backing their claims?

5qpkns,US - China conflict in the South China Sea: Which countries would more likely align with each side?,"My wild guesses/speculations appear below:

On the US' side:

Vietnam - They may not like Trump as a person or what he stands for, but afaik the Vietnamese leaders HATEHATEHATEHATE China and will gladly join in as a co-belligerent with Trump.

Taiwan - Trump has reached out enthusiastically to them, especially compared to any other president since Nixon.

Neutral or unclear:

Philippines: They historically have a dispute with China over the SCS, but Duterte is currently pro-China. He could face some pressure or even a coup if he doesn't pursue this conflict, though.

Japan/South Korea: Both countries I believe have disputes with China, but iffy relations with Trump. Idk if either would be willing to rock the boat.

Malaysia/Brunei: The other major disputants in the SCS controversy, both have Muslim majorities and governments that aren't as outspokenly anti-Beijing as Washington or Vietnam. 

Russia: The 500-pound gorilla in the room. Trump and Putin have generally been conciliatory, but I don't see Russia having any desire to take sides against China, with which they have a long border and substantial trade ties.

India: Has a dispute with China and has a right-leaning government, but idk if they have any interest or ability to take sides on this issue.

UK/Canada/EU: Generally allied to the US but opinions of Trump range from uneasy to downright hostile. I don't know if any of these would want into a war.

On China's side:

Quite possibly Singapore and at least one of Indonesia, Thailand, or Burma, although I don't think any of these would be able to project much force in the SCS.

Total wildcard:

North Korea. Very close to China historically, but relations are currently cold there and Kim has attempted to reach out to Trump.",19djafoij02,geopolitics,7,25,1485633991,/r/geopolitics/comments/5qpkns/us_china_conflict_in_the_south_china_sea_which/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/5qpkns/us_china_conflict_in_the_south_china_sea_which/,china,2025-12-08 23:50:54,pre,2025-12-09 00:21:35,THREAT,0.8,"The post discusses potential alignments in the context of a conflict between the US and China in the South China Sea, which implies military implications and risks associated with such alignments.",-2.0

67m3uu,Why is the US developing nuclear counterforce capabilities to target China's nuclear arsenal when China has a no-first-use policy?,"In 1964, China declared its No First Use policy, the first country in the world to do so. Today, [China continues to pledge to uphold NFU as part of its doctrine of minimal deterrence.](https://www.eastwest.ngo/idea/china-insists-no-first-use-nukes-threat-remains) However, the US has been systematically attempting to undermine China's second-strike capability with the goal of denying China of its nuclear deterrent:

* [China’s nuclear missile policy put under strain by US plan](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/09/chinas-nuclear-missile-policy-put-under-strain-by-us-plan.html)

The US has been expanding its nuclear counterforce capabilities with China in mind for a while now, as explained in the 2007 paper [""U.S. Nuclear Primacy and the Future of the Chinese Deterrent""](https://www.dartmouth.edu/~dpress/docs/Press_US_Nuclear_Primacy_CS.pdf) by a reputable Washington think tank.

Paradoxically, Obama had also been proposing that America's nuclear posture be more modest, even suggesting the adoption of NFU as well. However, [most other segments of the US government are greatly opposed to adopting a no-first-use doctrine for fear of it emboldening hostile adversaries.](http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2016/08/30/obama-needs-second-thought-no-first-use/)

Ask me anything about our reporting.","Tariffs, trade and Huawei have been dominating the news coverage as the relationship between Washington, D.C., and Beijing appears to be deteriorating. We went beyond the headlines to [talk to people with ties to both the U.S. and China](https://www.npr.org/series/729650981/a-foot-in-two-worlds). The stories in this team effort include Chinese students in the U.S. who face suspicion in both countries, as well as a Maryland lawmaker who left Shanghai in 1989.

I joined NPR in 1996 and have been with “Morning Edition” since 2004. I’ve interviewed presidents and congressional leaders, and my reporting has taken me to places like Baghdad, Beijing, Cairo, New Orleans, San Francisco and the U.S.-Mexico border.

9y1y7v,Will there be a US-China trade deal in Nov?,"I have been watching the news for a while, and today I would like to post some of my thoughts, please forgive my writing mistakes for English is not my first language.

My guess is yes, and here are reasons

## Trump may have a more realistic expectation.

It looks like Trump [realized that there is a limit on hardball.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1057997981922873344)   Of course, he can escalate this to a higher level, but it is less likely to get any result in a short term.   If there is a deal, then Trump would be the first president to ""force China to open its market"".

## The time is more mature for a deal.

In Oct 14th,  the Chinese ambassador said this [during his interview with Fox.](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/chinese-official-finds-trump-very-confusing-says-us-warships-at-chinas-doorstep-building-tension)

&#x200B;

>""They don’t know who is the final decision-maker. Of course, presumably, the president will take the final decision, but who is playing what role? Sometimes it could be very confusing.""

My interpretation is that ambassador Cui wants Trump to directly show a willingness to make a deal should there be any agreement.   And [Trump said so in an interview](https://thehill.com/policy/international/china/417166-trump-china-is-eager-to-make-a-deal-on-trade):

Based on the above points,  I think it's quite possible that there will be some framework level agreement which cancels part of or all tariffs that placed earlier this year.

9juu23,The US will lose more GDP than China in a global trade war,"[https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/focus/2018/html/ecb.ebbox201806\_01.en.html](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/focus/2018/html/ecb.ebbox201806_01.en.html)

A recent simulation by the European Central Bank showed that under a 10% US tariff on all imports and equivalent retaliation from other countries, the US would suffer a greater GDP loss from trade and consumer/investor confidence than China would.

&#x200B;

In addition to the 10% tariff, the simulation assumes:

&#x200B;

1. Trade disputes last 2 years

2. Additional fiscal revenues from tariffs go to reducing debt, rather than spending to support demand

3. Monetary policy and exchange rates are endogenous to the model

4. ""Confidence"" is measured by changes in equity and bond risk premia

&#x200B;

Under such conditions, US exports of goods and services would deteriorate, and US firms and consumers would lose confidence due to uncertainty about future policies, which would gradually increase the cost of capital in the US market.  Specifically:

&#x200B;

1. US GDP falls by 1.5% in the first year alone; gains in market share by US producers within the home market are outweighed by lower worldwide exports

2. US first also invest less and hire fewer workers over the 2 year period.

3. US GDP is 1% lower by the third year of the simulation from trade alone.

4. US GDP over the 3 years falls by an additional 0.7% due to higher equity and bond risk premia, for a total 2.2% GDP loss in the first year following full imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs.

&#x200B;

By contrast, China would gain by exporting more to third countries where U.S. goods are subject to tariffs, although that slight gain would be temporary and partly offset by a similar increase in the cost of capital in the Chinese market.  Specifically:

&#x200B;

1. Chinese consumption and investment falls in the first year, but is compensated by gains in China's net export position, as Chinese goods fall in price and are exported more to 3rd-party economies.  Hence Chinese GDP rises in Y1 by 0.5% from the trade effect.

2. Chinese exports begin to displace US exports in select sectors where substitutability is high.

3. Chinese GDP moderates in Y3, as the world economy adjusts to the new normal.

4. Far from hurting China, across-the-board US tariffs cause Chinese GDP to rise by a total of 0.3% in Y1 and return to flat over the course of the simulation.

&#x200B;

Finally, spillover effects markedly benefit 3rd-party economies, with countries that can substitute between imported products from different countries receiving the highest spillover benefit from the trade war.  The authors have not quantified this and will estimate it in a later study.

&#x200B;

\---------

&#x200B;

This is interesting because it shows that China has much to gain - and 3rd party economies do as well - by inducing the US to broaden the scope of its ongoing trade conflict to as many countries as possible and responding to the US trade conflict with a unified front.  This may be informing recent Chinese diplomacy in terms of trade, and will give other US trading partners leverage in negotiations with the US over the next few years.",chilltenor,geopolitics,45,44,1538207773,/r/geopolitics/comments/9juu23/the_us_will_lose_more_gdp_than_china_in_a_global/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/9juu23/the_us_will_lose_more_gdp_than_china_in_a_global/,china,2025-12-08 23:50:54,post,2025-12-09 00:21:35,ECONOMIC,0.9,"The post discusses the economic implications of a trade war, specifically focusing on GDP loss and tariffs, which are key economic factors.",0.0

9achn8,US-China Trade War as a Scapegoat for Failed NK Progress?,">***“I explained to the President of China that a trade deal with the U.S. will be far better for them if they solve the North Korean problem!”***  
>  
>\- Trump, April, 2017  [\[New York Times\]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/world/asia/trump-china-trade-north-korea.html)

​

China fell for the bait. Since April, 2017, China has enforced toughest UNSC sanction regime in history. Even according to Trump, China's help was instrumental in bringing North Korea to the negotiating table and bringing the Singapore summit into fruition.

​

China thought it did it's part in bringing NK to the peace table, but it got burned badly after Trump reneged on it's promise and slapped HUGE tariffs on Chinese imports. (With friends like this, who needs enemies?)

​

From China's perspective, it seems that Trump backstabbed China once China's usefullness expired (e.g. after NK was brought to negotiating table, Trump dumped China, and went back on their promise).

​

This leads me to two scenarios:

​

1. Trump genuinely thinks it can persuade China to denuclearize NK in exchange for ""better trade deal"". The Carrot & Stick approach to China.

​

OR

​

2.  Trump is using Trade War as a excuse to blame China for the failure of progression on US-NK denuclearization talks, because Trump had no hopes for it going anywhere in the first place, and needs a scapegoat.

​

The US-China trade gap is not relevant to addressing the underlying issue behind NK's ""siege mentality"" and insecurity about it's regimes survival, so it's like linking two issues that doesn't solve the underlying problem.

The author describes recent moves by both the US and China and analyses possible moves that both can make in the future from trade to IP to tourism to finance. Since the US and Chinese economies are connected with massive amounts of trade, and due to the interconnected nature of manufacturing of global supply chains, the author examines the impact of a trade war on both economies, and concludes that the impact would be minimal on the overall economy. To the end of containing the rise of China, the US would target the Chinese economy and hamper its technological and economical development. The decoupling of the Chinese economy from the US economy would also open the way for a more aggressive relationship, similar to that in the Cold War between the US and USSR. One weakness in the video is that the author does not go through the historical economic relationship between the US and China, which makes it hard to frame the changing geopolitical relationship as he terms it.",china,2025-12-08 23:50:54,post,2025-12-09 00:21:35,ECONOMIC,0.9,"The title explicitly mentions a 'trade war,' which is primarily an economic issue involving trade relations and tariffs between China and the USA.",0.0
98hrzs,"US & China talking trade, South Korea allegedly asks for an end to the Korean War, and the Department of Iranian Regime Change? - What's your take on the week that was?","Here’s our take on the week that was. We’re acutely conscious that there are many smarter, and more experienced people who frequent this sub, so we’re very keen to hear your takes.

Our three most significant stories this week:

* The US and China are now putting together a process aimed at resolving their trade dispute by November, when Xi and Trump will meet.

* South Korea allegedly asked the United States to consider formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War – in a bid to break a stall in US-North Korea talks.

* The US restructured the State Department, creating a special group focused on Iran – headed up by the former Director of Policy Planning (a very senior role). Pompeo said this is about changing Iranian behaviour, while experts said this is about changing the Iranian regime. 

Our three most thought-provoking articles of the week:

* Richard Haas, himself a former Director of Policy Planning, argued that without the glue of the Soviet threat, the US-Turkey relationship is destined to deteriorate.

* Rebecca Collard of Time Magazine gave a good overview of the stakes in Idlib, Syria – a city awaiting its fate as Assad’s tanks roll into position for a potential advance.

*  David Fickling of Bloomberg asked big questions of the fundamental economics of many of China’s Belt and Road projects, and argued that there are “echoes” of Soviet era collapse in Beijing’s misdirected spending. 

Three events to watch in the coming week:

* Whether the US and Turkey can patch over some of their many differences, after Turkey’s Foreign Minister said, “we are ready to talk about everything” so long as there’s “no threatening, no dictating”.

* Whether agreement on process can translate to agreement on sticky substantive issues at the US-China trade talks on 22 & 23 August.

* Whether US National Security Advisor John Bolton can make modest progress with Russia on arms control, at the follow up to the Trump-Putin summit.

94dja3,To what degree will the US-China trade war impact the Chinese economy in the long term?,"Just as a notice: I am aware that there is a Japan Times article in this sub which discusses a similar topic. However, it was published before recent developments took place which I'm mentioning in this post. I am curious to what the views of the users on this sub are.

The US-China trade war has heated up again today with news coming in which reports that China will slap tariffs on US$60 billion of American imports as a response to US tariffs:

[https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/03/china-reportedly-says-it-will-retaliate-with-tariffs-on-60-billion-in.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/03/china-reportedly-says-it-will-retaliate-with-tariffs-on-60-billion-in.html)

This lead to a response from Larry Kudlow, in which he called Chinese tariffs ""weak"" and the Chinese economy ""lousy"":

[https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/2158251/white-house-slams-chinas-weak-tariff-threat-and](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/2158251/white-house-slams-chinas-weak-tariff-threat-and)

This keeps me thinking about the developments of this summer. Economic indicators and the performance of the Chinese stock market (which has now been dethroned by Japan as the world's second largest stock market) have clearly shown that China has been on the bad receiving end. This, along with a vaccine scandal in July, has led to a rebuke of Xi Jinping's policies within the party. Even though it won't threaten his rule, it does pose the most significant challenge to it since 2012. 

Furthermore, it has already been revealed that the Chinese government has been caught off-guard by Trump's tariffs:

a78ai7,"Is One Country's Trash, Another Country's Treasure: What Happened When China Banned the Import of Waste Plastic?"," Since 1950, the word has produced 8.3 billion tons of plastic, and 322 million in 2015 alone. Plastic utensils and other waste is filling up our landfills and choking our oceans. Plastic can only be properly recycled after being sorted and graded, a labor intensive process that most wealthy consumers are unwilling to do. As a result, tens of millions of tons of plastic waste are exported to China where this plastic is recycled and re-purposed. The plastic recycling may have solved environmental problems in wealthy nations, but created new ones in China. The plastic imported  that could not be recycled was often dumped into China's streets and rivers, and between 10-15% of China's plastic waste originated in the developed world. Moreover, the acrid fumes and toxic by-products of plastic recycling damage the environment. Wen'an, the city at the center of China's plastic recycling industry, is one of the most polluted in China. To solve these problems, China effectively banned the import of plastic waste in 2017, creating a host of problems for the rest of the world.

It is estimated that 111 million tons of plastic worth $ 7 billion  need to be redirected to make up for the loss of Chinese markets, and over three quarters of world's plastic waste exports once went to China . Some of this plastic was redirected to other markets, although it is unlikely any set of countries can replace the central role placed by China. Imports of plastic waste to Indonesia have increased by 56%, doubled to Vietnam, and increased 10 fold in Thailand. Malaysia has emerged as the largest importer of plastic, importing an estimated 160 million tons of plastic waste, more than any other country in the world. However, the same environmental problems of recycling plastic has overwhelmed these countries. Malaysia and Thailand will ban the import of plastic by 2021, and it is likely over time other countries will follow suit. Much of the plastic once sent to China is accumulating in warehouses and recycling centers in wealthy nations, and no one knows what to do with it.  

The Chinese government banned the import of waste paper in addition to waste plastic. The economics of paper recycling are similar to that of plastic. China once imported $5 billion worth of waste paper, roughly half of the world's total.  However, unlike with plastic, India is increasingly replacing China in waste paper imports. Indian imports of waste paper have doubled since 2007, and thanks to China's ban, are expected to more than double in 2018. Much of the labor intensive process of sorting and grading waste paper happens in the slums of Indian cities where wages are low, and environmental standards lower. The most famous slum based recycling center is that of Dharavi, made famous by the movie Slumdog Millionaire, but it is hardly the only such recycling hub in India. After grading and sorting, the paper is sent to paper mills where it is converted into newspapers and packaging. It is expected that by 2025, two thirds of all the paper mill feed-stock will come from recycled sources, much of this imported from abroad.

I personally don't think it's likely because of the massive international backlash they'd get from the UN (and it would also escalate the situation with the US) but a successful invasion of Taiwan would give them a base right off the Japanese coastline. The PLA's currently got 2-3 Zubr Hovercrafts which are able to move 300-500 people from Fujian to Taiwan several times in a day, so with 20-30 of those a full-scale invasion of Taiwan would be much more plausible. Taiwan's also not recognised by the UN due to China being on the permanent 5 and hence able to veto, so Xi might decide it's worth doing in a few years once he resolves the Diaoyu islands situation.

To me, the Taiwan issue is 10 times more important than North Korea, and it will shape China/US relation in the future)

Prof. Jin recently gave a speech about China/US relations on 6/3/18. Here is the [video](https://youtu.be/c99khmZukUQ?t=1459) starting 24:34 What he said was that the [Taiwan Independence movement finally will have a referendum regarding Taiwan's Independence on April 6th, 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formosa_Alliance). So, he said, the referendum will remove any existing ambiguity among Taiwan/China/US about this issue. Without any space for maneuver, 2019 would be the year Taiwan issue will see the final solution, one way or another. Comments?

Some details of his talk:

* Taiwan is a domestic issue of China. Unlike a problem of foreign relations, Taiwan issue is not avoidable
* The Taiwan Independence Movement as a whole has lost their patience, the moving forward is imminent
* Holding a referendum on Taiwan Independence, regardless of the result, is a violation of China's anti-secession law. So, the act of approving such referendum will lead to military conflict, even before the referendum actually run
* China can not count on US to rein in Tsai. KMT is hopeless
* Xi is preparing for the final showdown. Lately, Chinese diplomacy is conservative (Japan/India/Russia etc)
* Jin hopes the Taiwan showdown can be avoided. However, his expectation is the 2019 might not be avoidable, and it is likely a military conflict with quite some bloodshed

958wb8,Bloc forming in the South China Sea: a plan on a napkin,"I have been mulling over approaches to Chinese aggression in the South China Sea. It's an issue for a number of reasons - a demonstration in failure on the part of internationalism, ceding strategic choke points to an authoritarian regime acting unilaterally, and finally, failure to effectively curtail action which will surely act as encouragement for further expansionist policy.

In my opinion, China would do better to hold multilateral talks to negotiate an one-sided agreement - while making a few concessions to the nine-dash-line position. Instead, it has created a situation where other claimants are advantaged by any multilateral agreement between each other to settle their individual disputes because the alternative is full Chinese occupation of all claims except the Sabah area. 

The collective power of the other claimants is not insubstantial - a population of 439 million people and a collective GDP of $2.3 trillion. 

In order to counter Chinese aggression, I posit that the United States sponsor multilateral talks between claimants with a view to settling boundaries between all competing states (China invited, yet voluntarily absent in an attempt to de-legitimise the talks).

To achieve success the outcome of these talks should be 1) agreed boundaries between all attendees, and 2) a military treaty between signatories to enforce the boundaries. If military treaty is funded collectively, with assistance from the United States in the forms of military aide and access to advanced weapons, a counterweight to China will be formed in the region. The collective defence arrangement would still be weaker against the Chinese PLA-N, but it could be enough to fundamentally change the equation for the Chinese.

The benefits of this course is clear: the US dislodge the Chinese with minimal loss of blood and treasure, the signatories would be able to legally exploit the resources in their region and acquire the ability to collectively protect their territorial integrity. 

I very much respect the views and quality of discussion from r/geopolitics subscribers so I am looking forward to reading some thoughtful critique of this approach.

So how geopolitics works between major powers like China and the US is confusing to me when we consider both have nukes on the table. I understand that China is building up a naval fleet, planting artificial islands, and developing  military bases around the South China Sea as a means to assert power over the region, but how and why do these have teeth when (in my mind) any military conflict where these would be useful would have a high risk of escalating to a nuclear war where the United States is involved? 

Stated otherwise: When nukes exist, what good are military bases, warships, and artificial islands when countries would be deterred from even using them in a conflict?

With China’s meteoric rise and the subsequent challenge presented to American hegemony in the region, coupled with Chinese historic claims to the area have made the South China Sea a volatile subregion, with the interests of other nations (Vietnam, the Philippines etc.) also involved. 

My questions:
Are the two destined to be adversaries? If so/not, why/why not? 

Are there any IR theories we can apply to this case? Every time a power has risen to a point where they could challenge the U.S. they’ve been defeated by the U.S.

Is there any possibility of a conventional conflict between these two?

9ypdhp,"If China was a democratic country, would US have any change on its policy towards China?","I'm a PRC national, over the last year, I've heard the argument from both inside and outside China that USA had some sort of expectation on China that potentially it would become a democratic country like those western advanced economies. if China was a democratic country, USA would treat China differently today. I was born and grown in 90s, since which time period China practices economic pragmatism. all the surroundings of my life are people trying to make more money. Before exposed to western media, I hardly had any ideological struggle.  To be honest, I feel it is a little bit difficult to empathize that western countries really treat democracy nearly as a religious belief.

Obviously a lot of media these days are claiming US recent policy change towards China is because that China became determined on insisting its own political system. But we have the example that Russia in 90s indeed became a democracy but we've seen US pushed its influence to Russian border, and Russia seemed was having a hard time to integrate itself into the world order dominated by western countries. My question is if China really became a democratic country, would that really bring some difference on current US-China tension? Would USA accept a democratic but VERY powerful China?",lizongyang,geopolitics,217,149,1542693831,/r/geopolitics/comments/9ypdhp/if_china_was_a_democratic_country_would_us_have/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/9ypdhp/if_china_was_a_democratic_country_would_us_have/,china,2025-12-08 23:50:54,post,2025-12-09 00:21:35,DIPLOMACY,0.8,"The post discusses the potential impact of China's political system on US policy, implying a focus on negotiation and relations between the two countries based on democratic values.",2.0

bhwtfm,The US does not spend much more than Russia and China on military-once you factor in Purchasing Power Parity(PPP)," There is this constant saying that the US ""spends the most on miltitary and you can combine the world's budget and it wouldn't equal the US"". However this is skewed because if you are looking at exchange ratios for USDs and not looking at purchasing power parity, the US does seem like this. However once you take in PPP, the US should not be much more powerful than lets say Russia and China combined. US spends also a lot on giving soldiers welfare, healthcare and paying their soldiers as a decent career.

&#x200B;

Here is the charts. $606 Billion for the US vs China's $434 in terms of PPP equivlancy. This is simply due to the fact in PPP terms, the US economy is smaller than China. You can probably buy a fighter jet in China much cheaper with less US dollars, similar how a American buys beer cheaper when going to Mexico. US does spend more on carrier and air forces, while China focuses more on land forces, so US does have the ability to hop around more around the world, and has more world bases. In terms of percentage of GDP, the US is not overwhelming to any degree and Russia spends a higher percentage.

So this talk on how the US military is spending too much vs. they are not spending enough, is easy to understand. If Chin and Russia attacked tommorow, they could probalby put up a real good fight if US acted alone. However the US has its allies(NATO, SK and Japan). The debate is whether or not the US should spend much more or much less is just a balance and compromise between independent action or allies. Also, the US has to deal with Iran and North Korea, as well as fight against Jihadism.

a94w52,What was the impact of the Philippines' Base Closure in 1992 on the US military's maritime strategy in the Asia-Pacific/South China Sea?,"I actually earlier asked this question on  [**r/MilitaryStrategy**](https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStrategy/) but did not get any response after a week, so I thought I may try to give this some thought.

Just to share a bit more about myself, I am from South-East Asia and the South China sea is right next to where I am, hence my interest in this topic.

 

I would like to ask for all of your opinions on what was the impact of the Philippines' Base Closure on the US military's maritime strategy in the Asia-Pacific/South China Sea?

The reasons I am asking is because I am currently reading 2 different Tom Clancy novels: The Bear and The Dragon as well as Threat Vector. I am reading both books and I may have gotten both details wrong but in both books, the US airforce was able to carry out a limited conventional war against China's Coastal defences using current military bases in Guan, some Pacific Islands, South Korea and Japan, as well as from aircraft carriers.

This was a bit jarring for me. I understand that it is purely fiction and all, but a quick look at a map shows the continental Asia is hemmed in from the Pacific, going from North to South, by: Japan, Korean Peninsula, Taiwan, Philippines, and Indonesian Archipelago.

The reason I am bringing this up is partly because I was taught quite a bit of the Pacific War in secondary school and the island-hopping strategy came up a lot. Vice Versa, my thinking (at that time) was that the Island-hopping strategy could be reversed to extend outwards towards to Pacific.

So I did a bit more research and came across this article: [https://breakingdefense.com/2016/04/chinese-scarborough-shoal-base-would-threaten-manila/](https://breakingdefense.com/2016/04/chinese-scarborough-shoal-base-would-threaten-manila/)

Let's take up example, China does build up air-projection facilities, based on the infographic in the article, on Woody island in the Paracel Islands, on Spratly Islands, and Scarborough Shoal, with fighter jets and bombers. This allows them to have overlapping control of much of the airspace over the South China Sea, in a form of a ""strategic triangle"".

Then I saw this article: [https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-the-us-military-should-worry-if-the-philippines-dumps-18189](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-the-us-military-should-worry-if-the-philippines-dumps-18189) and it got me thinking. Let's say, in any conflict in the South China Sea, the Philippines declare that its bases are off-limits to US military forces, how would the US Navy operate in the South China Sea? I am saying this based on the fact that there is some evidence that China has positioned offensive weaponry in at least 2 points of the strategic triange: Nuclear-capable bombers at the Paracel islands (source:[https://qz.com/1282707/chinas-military-ambitions-now-include-nuclear-ready-bombers-in-the-south-china-sea/](https://qz.com/1282707/chinas-military-ambitions-now-include-nuclear-ready-bombers-in-the-south-china-sea/)) and Anti-ship cruise missiles at Spratly islands (source:[https://qz.com/1269030/south-china-sea-china-has-cruise-missiles-on-what-started-as-a-fishermens-shelter/](https://qz.com/1269030/south-china-sea-china-has-cruise-missiles-on-what-started-as-a-fishermens-shelter/) ).

bin795,"Belt and Road expands, and the UK joins in.","'China hosted the second BRI forum this April and more countries participated than in the last. Italy, Austria, Hungary and Greece were among the participants and 150+ countries sent their delegates to Beijing. There were severe criticisms on the BRI, saying it was a 'debt trap diplomacy', a 'hegemonic delusion on the part of China' but despite such accusations, BRI seems poised to grow wider and stronger. 

In addition, China asked the UK for its expertise on finance in order to bring more transparency and efficiency to BRI projects, and it seems that the UK is eager to join the ride. Indeed, the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the United Kingdom said of the BRI as a ""vision"" and an opportunity for the world. Moreover, Theresa May's cabinet approved Huawei 5G infrastructure in England, thus marking an important step for improving bilateral ties. What is the UK's picture or grand scheme? Who knows, but I'm pretty sure they are acting according to the demands of their national interest. 

What are your predictions concerning the BRI? Can it become a genuine economic commonwealth for the people of Eurasia as some claim? or is it bound to fail because of its own weight?",seoulite87,geopolitics,39,19,1556527530,/r/geopolitics/comments/bin795/belt_and_road_expands_and_the_uk_joins_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/bin795/belt_and_road_expands_and_the_uk_joins_in/,china,2025-12-08 23:50:54,post,2025-12-09 00:21:35,ECONOMIC,0.85,"The post discusses the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and mentions economic aspects such as 'debt trap diplomacy' and the UK's financial expertise, indicating a focus on economic implications and trade relations.",0.0

[This article](https://www.theepochtimes.com/why-trade-with-china-is-not-free_2320640.html) lays out the case for how China's trade policies  have unfairly damaged the US economy and why the tactics of previous US administrations have failed to stem the losses. Among other points, it asserts that since accession to the WTO, China's subsidies, currency manipulation and high tariffs have ballooned the trade deficit and cost millions of American jobs.

On the other hand, economists widely agree that [the benefits of free trade outweigh the costs.](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/free-trade) Previous experiments with trade sanctions have [temporarily preserved small numbers of jobs at a huge cost to US consumers.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-tariffs-has-the-u-s-tried-in-the-past-and-how-did-they-work-out/)

Questions:

* Are China's trade policies widely regarded as ""unfair""?
* Have those policies caused the widening trade deficit and/or a decline in US jobs?
* To what degree have China's trade policies affected the wider US economy, both positively and negatively?
