c0gi8b,Why Iran benefits from these attacks,"So yesterday happened and the reaction I've found all across reddit has ranged from disbelief to confusion, so I thought I'd try to share my reasoning as to why I think these attacks benefit Iran the most. Given I believe that all countries involved in this mess are rational and intelligent actors(Except maybe Saudi Arabia on the intelligent  part), this means that if Iran is behind this attack then it was act of genius.


**Background**

Before we get to yesterday's events, it's worth summarizing what brought us here.
As you all know, the US has been imposing increasingly restrictive sanctions on Iran for over a year now, and has managed to dramatically decrease Iranian oil exports and coerce unwilling nations to abide by these sanctions using the threat of secondary sanctions. What's important to note here is that unlike the pre-JCPOA sanctions regime, the international buy-in is less due to desire and more due to coercion. Iran knows this.

As the US added sanction atop sanction, Iran kept threatening to shut down the strait of Hormuz in response, in the logic of ""If we can't sell our oil, neither can the Gulf states!"". The US did not take these threats lightly, which is good given Iran did not make them lightly. The first real attack on oil shipping happened last month, in a method quite similar to this attack. Iran was implicated, the West accused and warned, and we're back to the status quo. This attack however, has more sinister implications because of its timing.


**Timing of the Attack**

What sets apart last month's attacks from this one are two things related to its timing:

1) It comes after a Bolton-issued ultimatum that any attack in the Gulf will be met by a grave response.

2) It comes during a visit by the Japanese PM aimed solely at decreasing tensions.

I want to dwell on the significance of the second point, given I doubt anyone here needs an explanation about why point 1 is relevant. Why is PM Abe in Iran? No, he's not going to mediate to curry brownie-points with Trump, Japan has vital matters of national interest attached to this issue for a large chunk of its oil supply passes through these straits. It's essential that they remain open, and the country sees that this rise of tensions might threaten this supply. 

So as the Japanese PM is in Tehran trying to stave off this nightmare scenario, guess what happens? East Asia bound oil ships get attacked, and this was not lost on Japan as the government immediately stated that these ships had 'Japan-related' cargo on board. Immediately following the attack, Iran moved onto the PR front. Tweets by Khameini directed towards Japan urging it to ignore the US sanctions regime it was forced to buy into, statements by the Iranian government immediately getting ahead of the curve and setting the propaganda narrative, and even a statement saying something to the effect that Iran is the safety guarantor of the strait of Hormuz.

All of this happened and there was still radio silence from Western Capitals, who were either caught unawares or were trying to keep the markets calm or even both. 

**What is the message Iran sent?**

Through this well executed and well timed attack, Iran sent an important message to the coalition of the unwilling:

""The US is not able to guarantee freedom of navigation, and has forced you to buy into a sanctions regime you do not want to buy into and has left you to fend for yourselves as your ships get attacked in response.""

Japan and India, both importers of Iranian oil, were very reluctant about falling into line due to the threats to their oil supplies. Europe is also reluctant given the effects of any conflict would be acutely felt on the continent. And this is just the tip of the iceberg of countries that bought into Iran sanctions by coercion and also by the assumption that the US will protect them from their fears.

Even without all of that, a corner stone of US foreign policy and power is its intent and ability to keep shipping lanes open. In one fell swoop, Iran attacked this principle in a brazen way that obviously took everyone by surprise.

But if the Americans don't act to show the world that they are still guarantors of Free Navigation and that they will protect nations from the negative effects of the sanctions it forced them to buy into, then we will start seeing the unraveling of the sanctions regime sooner rather than later.

This is what the Iranians are hoping to gain from this attack, and this is why the American response in the coming days will be consequential. To me, this is a moment equal in gravity to Obama's Red Line although it might not feel like it now.",EmmanuelBassil,geopolitics,388,377,1560491318,/r/geopolitics/comments/c0gi8b/why_iran_benefits_from_these_attacks/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/c0gi8b/why_iran_benefits_from_these_attacks/,iran,2025-12-08 10:54:42,,2025-12-09 00:21:35,THREAT,0.85,"The post discusses attacks attributed to Iran, implying military actions and strategic benefits, which aligns with the framing of military threats.",-2.0

brs3uv,So have we been underestimating Trump with Iran politics? Like am I crazy to think Trump is at the best position right now?,"So something weird has been happening. Turkey is complying with US sanctions to Iran even tho it had butted heads with US on such issues as the S400. UAE, KSA, Israel have given almost absurd amount of restraint with their anti-Iran sentiment than its usually expected. EU has effective stopped caring anymore with special purpose vehicle. And Fox News and CNN are talking about “Bolton’s war”. And Russia seems weirdly nonchalant about Iran- instead focused more on Venezuela. And China has been cutting its imports from Iran- which is still going on with trade deal with the USA. 

Like it feels like everything is going for Trumps favor right now. If Iran stops compliance with the JCPOA, the world will turn on Iran more so than now and if it does comply with it, US still is crippling its economy and there is no way for it to survive for 10-15 years until sunset clauses expire. Iran doesn’t have a parasitic relationship with any nations like DPRK. 

So right now, Trump is in middle of a trade deal that China that desperately wants, with Huawei ban, and CTO in extradition process and DPRK opening up more than ever. 
Russia is straining itself with Syria, Iran, Venezuela, DPRK, Ukraine, Georgia, but most importantly, Russia does not have the economic power now oil need to help out Iran for its own purpose without cutting itself deep. Russia does benefit from expensive oil of its own when Iran cannot trade its cheaper crude.
Turkey, in middle of almost recession, having f35s blocked and tying for the EU membership and domestic policies like Istanbul win shows Erdogan is not as truly controlling. But, after US leaving Syria (I’m guessing Turkey feels was a gift from US), it would seem too much to then not send the favor to USA back. 

EU has been bit voiceful but the companies still have no opened up to Iran if they may lose US market either. And with Brexit debacle, where UK will probably side with US for a trade deal to heal Brexit, EU will have less tooth then. Especially when Trump keeps bring up NATO 2%. And after China, EU may be the new “new deal” time for Trump. Germany’s Auto sector is already sweating from sanctions with Nord stream 2.

98hrzs,"US & China talking trade, South Korea allegedly asks for an end to the Korean War, and the Department of Iranian Regime Change? - What's your take on the week that was?","Here’s our take on the week that was. We’re acutely conscious that there are many smarter, and more experienced people who frequent this sub, so we’re very keen to hear your takes.

Our three most significant stories this week:

* The US and China are now putting together a process aimed at resolving their trade dispute by November, when Xi and Trump will meet.

* South Korea allegedly asked the United States to consider formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War – in a bid to break a stall in US-North Korea talks.

* The US restructured the State Department, creating a special group focused on Iran – headed up by the former Director of Policy Planning (a very senior role). Pompeo said this is about changing Iranian behaviour, while experts said this is about changing the Iranian regime. 

Our three most thought-provoking articles of the week:

* Richard Haas, himself a former Director of Policy Planning, argued that without the glue of the Soviet threat, the US-Turkey relationship is destined to deteriorate.

* Rebecca Collard of Time Magazine gave a good overview of the stakes in Idlib, Syria – a city awaiting its fate as Assad’s tanks roll into position for a potential advance.

*  David Fickling of Bloomberg asked big questions of the fundamental economics of many of China’s Belt and Road projects, and argued that there are “echoes” of Soviet era collapse in Beijing’s misdirected spending. 

Three events to watch in the coming week:

* Whether the US and Turkey can patch over some of their many differences, after Turkey’s Foreign Minister said, “we are ready to talk about everything” so long as there’s “no threatening, no dictating”.

* Whether agreement on process can translate to agreement on sticky substantive issues at the US-China trade talks on 22 & 23 August.

* Whether US National Security Advisor John Bolton can make modest progress with Russia on arms control, at the follow up to the Trump-Putin summit.

8jds8j,Iranian deal - Panel debate For & Apposing (1hour soundcloud),"I listened to the debate hosted by Intelligence Squared on the Iranian deal. The panel For the deal urges those opposing it to provide an credible alternative for the deal.  I am still processing the arguments of both sides. I am against the Nuclear deal because the moment it happened the newspapers argued that the motion will make the world unsafe as the Iranian government will retaliate. \(so you must be afraid then\)

Soon after the statement of the newspapers, we saw on the morning hours of 10th May that Iranian units fired missiles into Israel \(according to IDF reports\) and we saw the American flag being burned inside the Iranian government. This, for me, translates that if Iran can retaliate in such matters, then imagine what they can do if something goes wrong according to their narrative once they have nuclear capabilities.

""Samuel Huntington's strategic points of view and his predictions [i.e. Clash of Civilizations] are not forgotten. He said: 'After the USSR, there are eight civilizations. Of them, only the Islamic and Chinese cultures will clash [with the West] in the future, and this will be violent and bloody.'

""Now, 30 years after Huntington said this, the world is seeing the deterioration of the West's might, and the shaping of the great civilization of Islam:

""1. America is $17 trillion in debt, and in effect is economically bankrupt.

""2. The world is witnessing the shaping of a multipolar regime with an Asiatic approach, in which Iran is a major axis.

""3. Iran has become the No. 1 power in the region, and it is very influential.

""4. The peoples of the world hate the behavior of the West in general, and particularly of America; this hatred is increasing by the day.

""5. The internal problems in America and in Europe are increasing, and this facilitates conditions for the emergence of new powers.

""6. The Western media empire is collapsing; the administration of the media is changing rapidly, and is no longer exclusively in the hands of the West.

""7. Iran is situated in the best spot in the [Asian] continent, and is unquestionably superior in the world with regard to oil and energy.

""8. Iran has the material and spiritual might and capability to export its revolution to the world.

""9. The Saudi regime that controls the Hijaz has suffered defeat in all its schemes to expand, and all its threats and efforts against Iran have become opportunities for Iran.

""10. The West, particularly America, cannot meet the needs of their people, because of the weakness of the liberal-capitalist [ideology], and have become helpless in the face of the Wall Street movement [sic].

""Therefore, our strong points must be matched with the weak points of the enemies, and our diplomacy must be adjusted in accordance with the long-term goals of the revolution.

""We must prepare ourselves to build a new world order. We need to build the new world order, and not to wait for others to shape the future according to their doctrine and their goals.

71y2bh,Thoughts on an Iranian land bridge?,"I was just wondering if folks had any thoughts on a possible extension of Iranian influence to the Mediterranean and what this possible extension’s effect would be on the security of the United States.

As ISIS fades, it seems like there may be a conflict along the Euphrates River. Most of western Syria seems to be back under the control of the Syrian government and some supporting militias, who are said to be backed by Iran. These forces seem to be moving north-east. But the north-east of Syria seems to be under the control of the SDF and U.S. special forces. Some of Eastern and southern Syria still seem to be controlled by anti-Assad forces as well.

According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-army/syrian-army-sends-more-troops-across-euphrates-close-to-u-s-backed-forces-idUSKCN1BT2B9):

 > A commander in a militia of the U.S.-backed SDF confirmed Syrian army units had crossed [to the eastern side of the Euphrates] and said his fighters were ready to drive them back.

I’ve seen some arguments that say that if the Syrian government takes back control of north-east Syria, and because Iran seems to support Shia militias in Shia majority Iraq, then Iran will have a “land bridge” through Iraq to Lebanon. I’ve also seen some arguments that say that the U.S. should launch another war against the Syrian government, these militias, and Russian special forces to defend Syria’s eastern border.

I'm under the impression that Syria has been an Iranian ally for some time, if I’m not mistaken. After the invasion of Iraq and before the Syrian Civil War, Iran reportedly began supporting Shia militias in Iraq. So it seems that Iran essentially had a land bridge during that time period. And despite having friendly governments in Syria and Lebanon, this Iranian influence did not seem to have a corrosive effect on the region. It did not seem to have an effect on American security either.

I’m wondering if, once ISIS is defeated, the US should war with the Syrian government, these militias, and Russian special forces to maintain control of Syria’s eastern border. How does that help American safety?

8xajg7,What was Trump's rationale for withdrawing from JCPOA just before meeting Kim-Jong Un?,"I've heard people say the move only undermined trust in America's word at precisely the worst possible moment. But given the timing, was it not more likely a deliberate signal to NK that they had better be prepared to make the concessions necessary to convince Congress?

The worst possible outcome for the US would be a half-measure or incrementally implemented deal that relieves pressure on NK only for NK to renege and rebound in an even more powerful position in future. On the other hand, it would be difficult to demand to NK's faces, after their charm offensive and gestures of good faith, that they should give up everything before receiving anything.

Could it be that withdrawing from the JCPOA was intended to resolve this dilemma? When negotiating with NK, the Trump administration can now point to the failure of JCPOA as justification for pursuing nothing less than a treaty with Congress, and then to the inflexibility of Congress as justification for making heavy demands before giving any concessions.

The Trump administration can now credibly exhibit good faith and trust in NK's intentions by pointing to Congress as an unshakable reality/constraint both parties have to work under -- a kind of good-cop bad-cop situation.

Ultimately the JCPOA may have eliminated a middle-ground that was considered dangerous from the American perspective, but would have been difficult to avoid by persuasion/positive negotiation.

Any thoughts?

8iscrx,I'm trying to understand the Iran Nuclear Deal and I have some questions,"This past week was finals week for me, but nonetheless I did some reading on the Iran Deal when I had the free time. I knew family and friends would be talking about it more, so knowing that I wanted to read some information on it so I could have more of an informed opinion. 

The Deal itself seems straightforward - cutting Iran's nuclear resources/supply, and lifting sanctions placed by Western countries as an incentive for Iran to abide by the Deal.  Checks and balances were put in place as another means to prevent Iran from cheating. Intricate details aside... in my (perhaps) limited understanding, I feel like the Deal makes sense. 

However, there are aspects relating to the deal that are not so clear to me. My questions are:

1) One of Trump's claims was that Iran is not adhering to the spirit of the deal by continuing to work on ballistic missiles and engage in sparse military actions in the Middle East. What is ""the spirit of the deal""? Did all countries involved agree to ""the spirit of the deal""?

2) Is there a way to measure adherence to ""the spirit of the deal""?

3) I have read claims here and there that this Deal ""is a death sentence for Israel"" and that it ""paves the way for Iran to develop nuclear weapons"". After reading through the Deal, those claims dont make much sense to me - can anyone address the validity of those claims?",pump_dragon,geopolitics,67,35,1526083228,/r/geopolitics/comments/8iscrx/im_trying_to_understand_the_iran_nuclear_deal_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/8iscrx/im_trying_to_understand_the_iran_nuclear_deal_and/,iran,2025-12-08 10:54:42,,2025-12-09 00:21:35,DIPLOMACY,0.8,"The post discusses the Iran Nuclear Deal, which involves negotiations and agreements aimed at regulating Iran's nuclear capabilities and lifting sanctions, indicating a focus on diplomatic efforts.",2.0

6oaqi1,Is Iran violating the nuclear deal? When do violations matter?,"Edit: I see people couldn't help but immediately downvote.

Bear with me, since I know this is unpopular (and may get downvoted to hell anyways). I've been seeing more and more people claiming lately that Iran, despite having been certified as complying with the Iran deal, has not actually been compliant. Certification is no guarantee, after all, since sometimes minor transgressions get overlooked in favor of certification of these types of things to preserve ties or because the costs of decertification are outweighed by the benefits of certification.

But I think it's worth looking into whether the Iran deal has been violated by Iran, since it helps understand the baseline at which countries may take action to decertify Iranian compliance, and can give us a sort of sneak peek into potential crises down the line.

So as I said, I started looking into claims of Iranian violations. The claims I've found are outlined by Republican Senators, who say that Iran has:

* Exceeded heavy water limits

* Exceeded limits on advanced centrifuges, and plans to expand the numbers even further

* Attempted to circumvent restrictions on acquisition of technology barred without UN Security Council approval

* Refusal to grant physical access to IAEA inspectors to Iranian facilities

So how credible are these accusations, and what is the context behind each?

The accusation about heavy water is easiest to investigate. Basically, [Iran has twice](https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-iran-exceeds-limits-heavy-water/3589850.html) exceeded the 130-ton limit on heavy water. Once, they had 130.1 tons, and the other time, it was 130.9. This is not all that concerning, and Iran dipped below the limit not long after. What *is* concerning is that heavy water, which can be used to create plutonium, is [being shipped out by Iran](http://www.dw.com/en/un-watchdog-iran-shipped-excess-heavy-water-to-comply-with-nuclear-deal/a-36671462), reportedly to Oman. While this doesn't violate the deal technically, it's a sizable and interesting loophole in the deal's text. So this matter doesn't seem dangerous, unless and until Iran starts bringing back heavy water it is storing elsewhere.

The second accusation, about nuclear centrifuges, is inherently difficult to verify. David Albright, head of the Institute for Science and International Security (unfortunately acronym'ed ISIS, since before ISIS was a thing), [testified to the US House of Representatives](http://isis-online.org/conferences/detail/house-subcommittee-testimony-of-david-albright-on-assessing-iran-nuclear-de/) on all of the alleged JCPOA violations. When he got to mention of the centrifuges, he noted another deal ambiguity. The deal allows for ""roughly 10"" IR-6 advanced centrifuges to be operated, but Iran is operating 15. This is based on the text of the secret Iran plan leaked to the Associated Press that goes along with the JCPOA, and is part of it. So Iran appears to have a violation here, if not a significant loophole yet again, but not a huge one at the moment.

The third issue is acquisition of technology. This is much more straightforward, and German intelligence has confirmed that Iran sought and seeks to procure dual-use materials that are barred to it under the JCPOA without UNSC approval. The deal states clearly that without UN Security Council approval, no state can transfer certain technology related to missile and nuclear technology to Iran, but Iran has sought to go outside of this channel and import illegally. Note: I am **not** calling missile tests a violation. Please don't bring up this straw man. But this is a pretty clear violation, though no one seems willing to act on it as of yet.

And finally fourth, the thing I found most interesting, is the report on claims that Iran is barring access to its nuclear sites by IAEA inspectors. Albright mentions this, saying that military sites are off-limits to IAEA personnel, which is a violation of the JCPOA. There is a dispute resolution mechanism for this, but it seems that the US and other states have not wanted to trigger it, again showing a cost-benefit analysis here, but a future point of serious contention. However, I've also noticed that the Sharif University visit is something that Albright reported on, not something the IAEA mentioned wanting to do. It's strange that I have found no mention of this proposed visit to a site, which means Albright may simply have incorrect information. However, there is also a curious lack of information regarding the Parchin site. IAEA inspectors [found uranium at Parchin](https://www.wsj.com/articles/uranium-provides-new-clue-on-irans-past-nuclear-arms-work-1466380760), which the Iranians insisted never housed any nuclear work, but there has been no follow-up visit to the site to ascertain the origin of the uranium samples, which the IAEA said was uncertain. That's also rather unusual, so it seems possible that the IAEA is not publishing full results of its requests to visit Iranian sites, and may be sharing them secretly with states who are involved in JCPOA compliance.

The significant friction points that remain, in my view, are the possibility of a clash over IAEA inspectors in the future, as well as the possibility of clashing over Iranian centrifuges. However, as many have noted, Iran's commitment to the heavy water limits has strengthened, and they went comfortably below the limit by the next report, likely in an attempt to avoid scrutiny by the new administration while waiting to see what the orange guy's ""tougher approach"" to compliance would be.

At what point, though, will this lead to friction? Is it possible that Trump is so preoccupied with whatever it is he's looking at that he'll give Iran more leeway? And will Europe respond if another German report comes out saying Iran is trying to circumvent restrictions on technology imposed by the deal, or will it just wait until Iran seeks a nuclear weapon, at which point it may be too late?",tayaravaknin,geopolitics,7,41,1500491423,/r/geopolitics/comments/6oaqi1/is_iran_violating_the_nuclear_deal_when_do/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/6oaqi1/is_iran_violating_the_nuclear_deal_when_do/,iran,2025-12-08 10:54:42,,2025-12-09 00:21:35,THREAT,0.8,"The post discusses Iran's compliance with the nuclear deal, which relates to concerns about nuclear weapons and potential violations that could indicate a military threat.",-2.0

92eue1,Which countries/companies do you think will comply with the American sanctions against Iran?,"Before the U.S ceased its participation from the JCPOA, multiple companies and individuals tried to get around the sanctions and they received a strong reaction from the U.S. I remember that multiple European Banks paid fines, Chinese mobile giant ZTE ended up paying a $1 billion fine.

As far as I know no country openly traded with sanctioned Iranian enterprises, because lots of foreign governments own American bonds. That said, I wouldn't be surprised if Cuban or Venezuelan governments did.

The sanctions are more complicated than "" Are you trading with Iran? If so, now pay fines"". Companies/Banks doing business with companies that trading with Iran also suffer from the consequences, its very difficult to get around this. For example: Turkish-Iranian businessman Reza Zarrab tried to launder money from his trade with Iran in Turkey, and now he is in an American prison with the banker helped him in money laundering.

Lets say that a country created an isolated company that only trades with Iran and decided not to spend or invest its revenue on anything or on very specific goods. Theoretically its possible, Europeans were discussing a similar plan. Its not financially wise not to do anything with your money, could this be a reasonable gamble if you are hoping embargo to be lifted in near future?  As far as I know, the laws don't work like that(one would argue the defendant has a right to benefit from changes in laws when its in his favor),  otherwise ZTE's fine would be lifted when the JCPOA was signed. If there is truly a way to get around this, who can guarantee the U.S won't find other ways to retaliate?

Personally, I only expect companies from countries already under American sanctions and the companies from countries with a small trade volume with the U.S not to comply with the sanctions. Iranian main export is gas and it could be bought from anyone, but for some countries exporting goods to Iran would be profitable. Potentially companies from especially Russia where part of finance sector is already under American sanctions and Turkey, a country doesn't export much to the U.S and would profit from ignoring the sanctions, may go for it. I naturally expect countries like Venezuela and Cuba to fully ignore it.

8huw5h,What war would be the most likely result of US sanctioning Iran?,"Assume that Trump decides to sabotage the Iran nuclear deal, imposing sanctions on Iran, asking for further concessions on the deal, or accusing Iran of being not in compliance.

This move is sure to ratchet up tensions across the Near and Middle East, further escalating Iran - Saudi rivalry and, as is often mumbled, may well lead to war.

But which war? US or Israeli strikes on nuclear sites in Iran? A replay of Syria in another country, like Yemen? Something in and around Palestine?

What are the odds?

87qr8k,Were Iran sanctions effective? Or did they make the country stronger in the long run?,"First, Iran was forced to diversefy their industry and couldn't rely solely on oil. Second the sanctions worked somewhat like tarrifs as they protected the home market. We can see this from the recent protests where the goverment is trying to impose rules that would be more in line with the market situation before the sanctions. On the other hand the ""protected"" domestic  market growth since the sanctions years makes Iran a powerfull force in the regional markets.

7xjo0q,"What is the geopolitical significance in the Middle East of so many Shiite Muslims living in the Persian Gulf's oil ""heartland?""","Especially considering that on one side of the Gulf, you have the Saudi Arabian absolute monarchy (Sunni-Wahhabist) who not only control Mecca and Medina (which has *major* global religious significance for Muslims, naturally), but, directly pertinent to my question, KSA's Eastern Province happens to be where both the oil is concentrated *and* where the Kingdom's Shiite population is concentrated. And then you have KSA's very close ally Bahrain, which is Shia-majority but controlled by a Sunni monarchy - in addition to the KSA's other close ally the UAE, and Kuwait being nestled between KSA's oilfields and the increasingly sectarian clusterf*ck that is Iraq, which of course is Shia Arab-majority (and majority-Shia-government - big rebuke to Saddam's legacy!), and the Shiite theocracy in Iran (the common enemy of Saudi Arabia and most of its allies in the GCC and the US government of course) - and Iran obviously has close ties to Assad in Syria (and both have close ties to Russia, especially Assad) and sponsors Hezbollah affiliates throughout the region and even in other parts of the world (e.g. Latin America).

How do the absolute, anti-democratic monarchies in KSA and other Sunni-dominant Gulf states that are domestically propped up by sectarian, extremely anti-Shiite Wahhabist clerics on the one hand, and - in sick and twisted irony - the US, the UK, and even Israel to some extent on the other, in terms of relations with Western states and states outside the Islamic world...well, **how do those regimes view the reality of the huge Shiite population on both sides of the Gulf - both in Iran and other Shiite populations whom are  (potentially) allied with Iran and Assad - being right in the ""oil heartland"" of the Middle East? Furthermore, how do the US and its allies in general perceive these facts  economically and geopolitically? Where does the view of the ""Shia Crescent"" threat factor in?

7m1680,What do we know about the treatment of Hezbollah by the Obama administration near the time of the Iran deal?,"Politico reports that the DEA launched an investigation into Hezbollah in 2008, called Project Cassandra, and has evidence that Hezbollah is now a international crime syndicate that ""collects $1 billion a year from drug and weapons trafficking, money laundering and other criminal activities.""

[Politico reports that](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/obama-hezbollah-drug-trafficking-investigation/):

>When Project Cassandra leaders sought approval for some significant investigations, prosecutions, arrests and financial sanctions, officials at the Justice and Treasury departments delayed, hindered or rejected their requests.

>The Justice Department declined requests by Project Cassandra and other authorities to file criminal charges against major players such as Hezbollah’s high-profile envoy to Iran, a Lebanese bank that allegedly laundered billions in alleged drug profits, and a central player in a U.S.-based cell of the Iranian paramilitary Quds force. And the State Department rejected requests to lure high-value targets to countries where they could be arrested.

David Asher, a Defense Department illicit finance expert who worked on Project Cassandra, said about the decisions which hindered the project: 

>""This was a policy decision, it was a systematic decision. They serially ripped apart this entire effort that was very well supported and resourced, and it was done from the top down.""

John Brennan, Obama's top counterterrorism adviser and then CIA director wrote that:

>“the next president has the opportunity to set a new course for relations between the two countries” through not only a direct dialogue, but “greater assimilation of Hezbollah into Lebanon’s political system.”

Why would Brennan want Hezbollah to have more political power?

In 2010, Reuters reported that at a conference in Washington, Brennan said:

>“Hezbollah is a very interesting organization,” Brennan told a Washington conference, citing its evolution from “purely a terrorist organization” to a militia to an organization that now has members within the parliament and the cabinet.

>“There is certainly the elements of Hezbollah that are truly a concern to us what they’re doing. And what we need to do is to find ways to diminish their influence within the organization and to try to build up the more moderate elements,” Brennan said.

Ali Fayad, A Lebanese arms dealer ""who had been indicted in U.S. courts on charges of planning the murders of U.S. government employees, attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization and attempting to acquire, transfer and use anti-aircraft missiles"" was arrested in Prague in 2014. He was in custody for 2 years, but

>top Obama administration officials declined to apply serious pressure on the Czech government to extradite him to the United States, even as Putin was lobbying aggressively against it.

>He is now believed by U.S. officials to be back in business, and helping to arm militants in Syria and elsewhere with Russian heavy weapons.

Katherine Bauer, a Treasury official under Obama, [testified in February 2017](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4329058-Katherine-Bauer-testimony-to-the-House-Committee.html) that

>“under the Obama administration … these [Hezbollah-related] investigations were tamped down for fear of rocking the boat with Iran and jeopardizing the nuclear deal.”

Politico adds to this by reporting:

>As a result, some Hezbollah operatives were not pursued via arrests, indictments, or Treasury designations that would have blocked their access to U.S. financial markets, according to Bauer, a career Treasury official, who served briefly in its Office of Terrorist Financing as a senior policy adviser for Iran before leaving in late 2015. And other “Hezbollah facilitators” arrested in France, Colombia, Lithuania have not been extradited — or indicted — in the U.S., she wrote.

David Asher said that

>“The closer we got to the [Iran deal], the more these activities went away. So much of the capability, whether it was special operations, whether it was law enforcement, whether it was [Treasury] designations — even the capacity, the personnel assigned to this mission — it was assiduously drained, almost to the last drop, by the end of the Obama administration.”

After the Iran deal was put into place,

>within months, task force officials said, Project Cassandra was all but dead. Some of its most senior officials, including Jack Kelly, the veteran DEA supervisory agent who created and led the task force, were transferred to other assignments. And Asher himself left the task force long before that, after the Defense Department said his contract would not be renewed.

>As a result, the U.S. government lost insight into not only drug trafficking and other criminal activity worldwide, but also into Hezbollah’s illicit conspiracies with top officials in the Iranian, Syrian, Venezuelan and Russian governments — all the way up to presidents Nicolas Maduro, Assad and Putin, according to former task force members and other current and former U.S. officials.

Derek Maltz, who oversaw Project Cassandra as the head of the DEA’s Special Operations Division for nine years, said:

>“Certainly there are targets that people feel that could have been indicted and weren’t. There is certainly an argument to be made that if tomorrow all the agencies were ordered to come together and sit in a room and put all the evidence on the table against all these bad guys, that there could be a hell of a lot of indictments.”

>“There’s no doubt in my mind now that the focus was this Iran deal and our initiative was kind of like a fly in the soup,”

74i5dh,Trump recently stated that he wants to “decertify” the Iran Deal. What does this entail?,"I read [this article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-plans-to-declare-that-iran-nuclear-deal-is-not-in-the-national-interest/2017/10/05/825c916e-a9e3-11e7-b3aa-c0e2e1d41e38_story.html) on how Trump is planning to “decertify” the Iran Deal.

What does this entail?

Would there need to be Congressional approval to formally exit the Iran Deal?

If I could remember correctly, [Congress passed the Russia sanctions bill almost unanimously that included Iran in the provision for more sanctions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/on-russia-sanctions-trump-has-a-point/2017/08/03/e6696790-7888-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304_story.html?utm_term=.1411e71a1e14), so how much control does Congress have as of right now to pass sanctions?

Doesn’t the US Treasury have the power to issue sanctions without Congressional check, as seen with [Venezuela](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-hits-13-venezuelans-with-sanctions-in-advance-of-critical-vote/2017/07/26/d80a6ac0-721e-11e7-9eac-d56bd5568db8_story.html?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.08f58e11c25c)?",Ravenclaw968,NeutralPolitics,186,48,1507230188,/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/74i5dh/trump_recently_stated_that_he_wants_to_decertify/,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/74i5dh/trump_recently_stated_that_he_wants_to_decertify/,iran,2025-12-08 23:51:02,pre,2025-12-09 00:21:35,DIPLOMACY,0.7,"The post discusses the implications of decertifying the Iran Deal, which relates to negotiations and international agreements, indicating a focus on diplomatic relations.",2.0
71ui9k,Does the Iran Deal currently prevent the Iranians from a pathway to a bomb,"I recently saw this article:
http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/09/22/iran-nuclear-deal-bomb-215636

Which argues that the deal is not effective because it allows Iran to continue using and testing IR 8 centrifuges. I remembered at the time of the implementation that I had heard positive coverage of the deal and the inspections, and this vox article:
https://www.vox.com/2015/4/2/8337347/iran-deal-good

argues it is an effective stop because of the restrictions on mining and the use and construction of new centrifuges.

I also found the text of the deal itself: https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/full-text-of-the-iran-nuclear-deal/1651/

Does the deal effectively prevent an Iranian bomb, and for how long?  

How does the deal compare to other historic arms control agreements?

8njp58,Is Israel driving a wedge between Russia and Iran? / Russia Denies Aerial Skirmish With Israel As The Two Countries Look To Make Syrian Deals,"Two articles have been published recently which I though are good analyses with similar points: the good working relationship between Israel and Russia, the looming question of the next Syrian Arab Army's offensive with the role of Iran generally in Syria and specifically in this area bordering Israel and Jordan, and the role of the United States and other forces in Syria.

* http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-44313744

* http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/21168/russia-denies-aerial-skirmish-with-israel-as-the-two-countries-look-to-make-syrian-deals

With the Israeli defense minister in Russia this week, recent affirmations by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of the desire for 'mutual' 'two-way street' withdrawal of foreign forces from Syria and that no foreign forces should be involved in the next Syrian offensive, and the lack of serious action by Russia regarding Israeli strikes into Syria, it would seem to show that Israel and Russia have been able to come to a reasonable understanding regarding each other's interests.

*[...] Lavrov said at a press conference on May 28, 2018, in what appeared to be a statement pointed at both the United States and Iran. “The result of this work which should continue and is continuing should be a situation when representatives of the Syrian Arab Republic’s army stand at Syria’s border with Israel.”*

But how will this effect the United States' role in Syria, and their forces currently stationed in the country? Will the US accede to a withdrawal that would allow the SAA to advance, even if allies Israel and Jordan sign-off? And how deep really is the Israeli-Russian relationship, and how can Russia realistically balance its role as partner with both Iran and Israel?

8axuhc,"In the event of a military conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, where would Turkey and Qatar's interests lie?","Over the last few years, it's become increasingly clear that Turkey and Qatar have interests noticeably at odds with other Sunni powers in the region, notably KSA, UAE, and Egypt. Some examples of cases where these different interests have been on display -

- [Backing different factions in Libya](http://www.middleeasteye.net/essays/foreign-actors-and-libyan-civil-war-878614656)

- [Different stances on Israeli relations](https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-love-affair-with-saudi-arabia-on-the-rocks/4141746.html)

- [Opposed approaches to the Muslim Brotherhood](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-03/saudis-are-after-the-muslim-brotherhood-and-turkey-s-in-the-way)

These two power blocks had somewhat shared goals in Syria, with both opposing the Assad regime. That might have changed somewhat more recently, however, with [warming relations between Turkey and Iran](https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-turkey-relations-deepen-shared-regional-goals/4119043.html).

My question for the sub, then, is whether - in the event of a more serious breakdown in relations between Iran and KSA - what response we can expect from Turkey and Qatar. Would they be more likely to see such a breakdown as an opportunity to further weaken KSA's hegemony, or would confessional ties to their fellow Sunni muslims trump their geopolitical concerns?

c0plzb,Trump's non-response against Persian Gulf attacks,"Two tankers originating from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were hit by sabotage attacks, just one month after four tankers anchored off the UAE coast were targeted by what international investigators say was almost certainly a state actor. This time, the attacks were carried out in broad daylight and while the vessels were exiting the Strait of Hormuz at full speed. 

The Norwegian-owned, Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Front Altair was badly damaged by an attack that left a column of smoke rising from its hull. With a capacity of 110,000 deadweight tons, the medium-size Aframax crude carrier was sailing from Abu Dhabi’s al-Ruwais refinery to Taiwan with a 75,000-ton cargo of naphtha, a slow-burning petroleum product used as feedstock at refineries. Photos and aerial footage appeared to show a point of impact in the middle of the ship, but also significant fire damage to the accommodation island and engine room, suggesting the tanker was subjected to multiple attacks that will likely render it a total loss (though it appears to have maintained its structural integrity for the time being).

About an hour later, a second tanker was attacked about seventy nautical miles from Fujairah and fourteen nautical miles off Iran’s coast just south of Jask, not far from the first attack. The Japanese-owned, Panamanian-flagged Kokuka Courageous, a smaller 27,000-deadweight-ton vessel, was sailing from the Saudi port of Jubail to Singapore with a cargo of methanol. A waterline breach in its starboard hull caused a fire in the engine room; the vessel is apparently taking in water, though the cargo is reportedly intact.

The two attacks occurred less than fifty kilometers from each other and just outside Iran’s territorial waters, under the watchful eyes of Iranian radar and monitoring stations. Although the attacks appeared to come from the west side of the ships, their location was suspiciously close to important Iranian naval facilities at Jask. If the copious evidence of Iranian involvement proves true, what does the incident say about Iran’s near-term intentions in the area?

Initial reports suggested the tankers may have been hit with torpedoes or surface attacks, but credible eyewitness reports indicate that explosives were attached to their hulls using speedboats (whose wakes could have been mistaken for torpedoes to the untrained eye). The crew of the Kokuka Courageous abandoned ship after they discovered an unexploded device still clinging to the hull; surveillance footage released by the US Navy showed a speedboat manned by Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy personnel trying to remove the device. Iran has yet to disclose the discovery of such an important piece of evidence.  

The Altair crew were rescued by the regular Iranian navy and taken to Jask and then Bandar Abbas, while sailors from Kokuka Courageous were eventually taken in by the American guided missile destroyer USS Bainbridge. It is not known whether the footage of the explosive’s removal was taken before or after the sailors were rescued.

At a subsequent news conference, the Japanese owner of Kokuka Courageous stated that the crew had detected high-speed flying objects approaching the ship right before the attack, suggesting that at least some of the explosions may have been caused by explosive-laden suicide drones. Iran has a military airstrip about fifty kilometers northeast of the attack location that is frequently used to operate drones. As for the planted explosives, they seem to have been timed to detonate just after the tankers cleared the Strait of Hormuz, but still in proximity to Iranian waters.

These facts, coupled with the amount of coordination required to carry out such operations, leave little doubt that Iran is once again the culprit. As happened during Persian Gulf naval confrontations with the United States in the 1980s, Iranian leaders are not expected to take responsibility for the actions of their forces in local waters. In the past, they have credited attacks to “the hand of God” or blamed Western countries for mining incidents, only to take credit for them later (e.g., off the coast of Fujairah in 1987). It would come as little surprise to hear them make similar claims today (Iran’s UN mission has already blamed the United States for the explosions, while a maritime agency official claimed that “technical problems” most likely caused the fires on both ships).


The increasing momentum of the US financial pressure campaign has prompted Iran to react more aggressively of late. In a May 29 speech, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei declared that the “only way” to gain strategic leverage over America is to beat Washington at its own game of pressure (not through negotiations, which Khamenei described as the preferred US tactic), but rather through “our own tools of leverage,” including “military tools.” He promised to use more such tools if the regime’s recent threat to resume certain nuclear activities did not yield the desired result of easing sanctions and helping Iran’s economy. Given such rhetoric, it is difficult to view the latest attacks as anything but the regime doing just what Khamenei said it would.

The tanker incidents could also be seen as an attempt to challenge America’s measured deterrence and its position as a superpower. Indeed, if the attacks go unanswered, they could undermine US credibility among its regional allies. At the same time, Tehran presumably hopes to manage escalation, maintain the element of surprise, and preserve plausible deniability. The latter goal may explain why Iran rushed to rescue some of the stranded sailors, who might also serve as human shields if the United States or other actors launch retaliatory action.

The attacks also coincided with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe’s much-anticipated visit to Tehran, raising speculation that Iran targeted a Japanese ship to send a bold and clear message of dissatisfaction with Tokyo’s role in upholding US sanctions. Just hours before the attacks, Khamenei publicly declared that President Trump was not worth exchanging messages with, a seemingly direct slap at Prime Minister Abe, who was rumored to be carrying a message from the White House for Iran. This tactic would be in keeping with the IRGC’s penchant for undermining and humiliating Iran’s own Foreign Ministry whenever a domestic scapegoat is needed to absorb blame.

The nature of the tankers’ cargo sheds further light on how far the Ayatollah may be willing to go. The Kokuka Courageous is a type 2 chemical tanker clearly marked to carry products that pose severe environmental and safety hazards. A premeditated attack against such a vessel shows complete disregard for the significant environmental and human damage that spilling such products could cause. One can therefore expect future attacks to raise the risk of oil slicks and other such problems.

Moreover, al-Ruwais refinery, the origin of one of the tankers, is considered a major regional competitor to Iran’s petrochemical industry and a major beneficiary if new sanctions on Iran’s petrochemical exports wind up having a severe impact on the regime’s bottom line. In that sense, the attacks could have been designed as direct retaliation against those sanctions. The broader warning seems clear: that the region should not expect calm at a time when Iran’s oil export revenues are falling to record lows and its petrochemical revenues are threatening to do the same. Rather, the regime’s disruptive measures may gradually expand in size, geography, and complexity, perhaps even extending to military targets. 

During an interview this morning, president Trump said Iran did it, but the US [won't do anything](https://youtu.be/rx5hA9G_bac) about it.

Will US deterrence suffer because of Trump's isolationism? As long as Americans are not targeted it seems that Trump is fine with the attacks.

Recently as some may know the US has decided to remove exemptions for sanctions on Iranian Oil by May 3rd. Iran in response has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz as a form of retaliation since, if it has no trading partners left, its economy will collapse and it will see fit that if Iran cannot trade, no one can. 

The Strait of Hormuz is a key area that sees barrels of oil being transported to the world daily. It is essential to every gulf and Arab nations economy.

Personally, I’ve heard Iran get a bit aggressive in it’s responses before but no actual action was ever taken. However, I’ve been listening to more people and reading articles that suggest that America is attempting to collapse the nation, and that this would be the last straw. 

Were this to happen, I personally think it’s completely within the realms of possibilities that Iran follows through leading a stand off with the US Navy, possibly a hot war. 

I’d like to get a discussion going with this subreddit on whether an agreement will be reached before hand between America and Iran as to prevent these events from occurring, if Iran will follow through, how a standoff will look like, and what will happen during a hot war including key players.",MorseES13,geopolitics,18,32,1556515138,/r/geopolitics/comments/billvs/strait_of_hormuz/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/billvs/strait_of_hormuz/,iran,2025-12-08 23:51:02,post,2025-12-09 00:21:35,ECONOMIC,0.85,"The post discusses the impact of US sanctions on Iranian oil and Iran's economic retaliation, indicating a focus on economic aspects and trade implications.",0.0

In announcing this, President Trump also stated that the US will reimpose sanctions on Iran which were lifted as part of the deal.

Iran has stated that [they will negotiate with the remaining parties to the deal about whether they will retain its structure.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iran-prepared-for-all-scenarios-if-trump-nixes-nuclear-deal-officials-say/2018/05/08/531047a0-5241-11e8-a6d4-ca1d035642ce_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.a0b2eb340b32)

Given all of this, what are the specific economic, geopolitical, and military incentives faced by Iran following US withdrawal?
