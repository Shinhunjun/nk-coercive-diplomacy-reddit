Yet they find it OK to violate the treaty they signed guaranteeing a ""one country, two systems"" when Great Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese control by violently suppressing free speech in the former colony, even though they could have avoided the embarrassment by just not attempting to put Hong Cong under the mainland system, as promised.

Executive Summary

The Chinese Communist Party has largely observed a technical, de jure separation between itself and the state, including the legal system — even while de facto controlling the state apparatus and often disregarding and devaluing the law — for much of the 70 years it has ruled the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Party General Secretary Xi Jinping is dismantling that pretense through assertion of comprehensive party leadership over everything, including law. Yet, his push to codify party leadership into law and making explicit the party’s command of “socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics” suggest that Xi appreciates the legitimating power of law. Under his incumbency, the party has made “governing the country in accordance with law,” commonly translated as “law-based governance” (依法治国), a cornerstone of the party’s governance strategy, along with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The party, while demanding “absolute” leadership of political-legal work, continues to delegate to state legal institutions the responsibility to address and resolve complex matters on a day-to-day basis in a professional, efficient, fair, and autonomous manner to help maintain social stability and promote economic development.

At the same time, the authoritarian party-state continues to bypass state legal requirements, or adopts and applies illiberal ones, when dealing with what it views as sensitive matters. Relying on extra-legal detentions and other coercive measures, Xi has overseen an unprecedentedly organized and sustained crackdown on civic and labor activists, religious leaders, journalists, and ethnic and religious minorities — most blatantly in Xinjiang and Tibet. The crackdown has also targeted outspoken academics and students, as well as the legal profession that the party purports to entrust to protect the public’s lawful rights and help achieve law-based governance. In practice, the party maintains a dual state and legal system, under which the majority of Chinese people generally enjoy the protection of an increasingly sophisticated body of law and legal institutions, but those deemed a danger to the party-state are handled outside the law.

The substantive impact of Xi’s push to institutionalize and legalize party leadership over everything is not clear. To date, the party appears to view its leadership as primarily political and seeks to promote a professionalized, efficient, and effective state, economy and legal sector. It is sending mixed messages, however. Emphasizing party leadership raises concerns about increased politicization of decisionmaking, with less transparency and accountability, potentially threatening not only economic and social development, but also the rule-of-law project that is intended to enhance party legitimacy. The party’s conditional attitude toward law, reflected in its continued resort to extra-legal means in dealing with perceived enemies, creates uncertainty over the reliability of the party-state’s legal commitments both at home and abroad.",NineteenEighty9,geopolitics,13,7,1577452864,/r/geopolitics/comments/egb3d1/party_leadership_and_rule_of_law_in_the_xi/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/egb3d1/party_leadership_and_rule_of_law_in_the_xi/,post_hanoi,china,2025-12-12 17:19:33,"Party leadership and rule of law in the Xi Jinping era: What does an ascendant Chinese Communist Party mean for China's legal development? https://www.brookings.edu/research/party-leadership-and-rule-of-law-in-the-xi-jinping-era/amp/?__twitter_impression=true

ebjqjl,Russia poses a greater and more immediate threat to NATO than China in the short term. (Long read),"For the past three years since leaving the military, I've been working as an analyst for a geopolitical think tank with a particular focus on Russian affairs. (I'd prefer to leave them nameless as quite obviously not every opinion I've espoused on Reddit is representative of their work).

I should specify, that within the halls of power (government, military planning and intelligence agencies) the notion that the military threat posed by Russia exceeds that of China, is not an unpopular or particularly controversial opinion at all, however among the broader general public - and specifically here on Reddit, there seems to be a prevailing attitude that the threat posed by Russia is significantly less or even at times, non-existent.

To understand why Russia poses such a serious threat to the west and why it is more immediate than that posed by China we must first understand the broader strategic and foreign policy objectives of both the Russian and Chinese governments.

Russian foreign policy objectives can broadly be defined as a desire to prevent further eastern expansion of NATO and to re-integrate former territories of the USSR back into their sphere of influence. [\[1\]](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1800/RR1826/RAND_RR1826.pdf)

Russia recognises that is no longer a peer competitor to the United States and it's global hegemony, but seeks to gain further regional influence in both Eastern Europe and the Middle East in order to secure it's position as a major player on the world stage. [\[2\]](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/02/20/russia-s-global-ambitions-in-perspective-pub-78067)

China, for it's part, sees itself as an emerging global superpower that will inevitably be able to challenge US hegemony in the near future.

It too has irredentist ambitions in it's region, most notably the re-integration of Hong Kong, Macau and the eventual unification of Taiwan with the mainland, however at present, China is largely content to bide it's time and gain increased leverage or influence over other nations by peaceful means (trade, infrastructure investments, development assistance etc) rather than militaristic means. This is best surmised by Xi Jinping's signature initiative, the [Belt and Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative), as well as by former Chinese premier Hu Jintao's own signature initiative the [Peaceful rise of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%27s_peaceful_rise).

Russia on the other hand - has already engaged in significant military interventions against it's neighbours, assassinations at home and abroad, global influence campaigns - and threatening rhetoric to accomplish it's geopolitical aims.

These actions have bought them into direct opposition to NATO on several occasions already and the risk of further escalation is seemingly inevitable.

Russia has, on two separate occasions now, illegally invaded and annexed territory from two of it's neighbours to prevent these states from re-aligning themselves towards western powers.

In 2008, Russian backed separatists armed and supported by the Russian military seized land in the [Abkhazia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abkhazia) and [South Ossetia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Ossetia) regions of Georgia in response to the Georgian governments desire to seek closer ties with NATO and the EU. [\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War) [\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia%E2%80%93NATO_relations)

Following this, in 2014 - after the [Euromaidan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromaidan) protests overthrew the Ukranian government of pro-Moscow President [Viktor Yanukovych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Yanukovych) and Ukraine itself signalled it's intentions to join NATO [\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine%E2%80%93NATO_relations), Russian military units, devoid of their insignia and other identifying marks [\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_green_men_(Ukrainian_crisis)), illegally entered Ukranian territory and seized both the Crimean peninsula (with it's vital warm water naval port in Sevastopol [\[7\]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/07/ukraine-russia-crimea-naval-base-tatars-explainer)) and regions of Eastern Ukraine. The Russian government vehemently denied at the time that these were Russian troops [\[8\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/putin-denies-russian-troops-are-in-ukraine-decrees-certain-deaths-secret/2015/05/28/9bb15092-0543-11e5-93f4-f24d4af7f97d_story.html), though Crimea itself has now been directly annexed into the Russian federation [\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation) \- and the territories in Eastern Ukraine now form the basis for the entirely fictional state of Novorossiya or ""New Russia"". [\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novorossiya_(confederation))

Both times, the Russian government claimed it's actions were an attempt to protect Russian speaking minorities in each of these countries [\[11\]](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-ethnic-russification-baltics-kazakhstan-soviet/25328281.html) and it has used this pretence to support it's claims in other regions too, notably in the Baltic states (where large numbers of Russian speakers reside) and Eastern Poland. The difference between Georgia/Ukraine and the Baltic states/Poland is that the latter, are fully fledged NATO members. Putin himself has nonetheless, privately expressed a desire to see these territories re-integrated. [\[12\]](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11106195/Putin-privately-threatened-to-invade-Poland-Romania-and-the-Baltic-states.html)

As well as their direct military interventions in non-NATO countries, Russia has for many years now engaged in military posturing and provocation against NATO. Frequently violating air and naval zones in so called [""buzzings""](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/russia-testing-nato-the-skies-21621) and conducting the largest military exercises in European history along it's western borders. Exercises that far exceed in size those conducted by NATO itself. [\[13\]](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/the-nato-russia-exercise-gap/)

The message is relatively clear. Russia is both capable of using - and fully prepared to use military force to reclaim territory or influence lost following the collapse of the Soviet Union and has invested considerably in the modernisation of it's conventional and nuclear forces to enable it to. [\[14\]](https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/2019-04-04-Dick.pdf)

In addition to the conventional military threat posed by Russia, their exists a more sinister and omnious threat to western interests through the willingness of the Russian government to use dangerous and prohibited substances to assassinate targets both at home and abroad.

In 2006, prominent critic of the Russian government and of Putin in particular, [Alexander Litvinenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Litvinenko) was murdered in London after consuming tea laced with [Polonium-210](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonium-210) a radioactive element that left a hazardous trail of material all over the English capital [\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexander_Litvinenko#Polonium_trails). 12 years later in 2018, former Russian spy now living in exile in the UK, [Sergei Skripal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Skripal) was himself targeted for assassination through the use of [Novichok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novichok_agent), a binary chemical weapon and nerve agent that once more left a hazardous trail around the town of Salisbury, UK which resulted in the poisoning of both Skripal and his daughter, two police officers who attended the crime scene and a further two individuals who found the discarded perfume bottle used to spray Novichok over the front door of Skripal's house, one of whom would later tragically die as a result. [\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Sergei_and_Yulia_Skripal)

Both instances have been tied directly to agents of the Russian GRU intelligence agency acting on orders from the highest levels of the Russian government. [\[17\]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/493860/The-Litvinenko-Inquiry-H-C-695-web.pdf) [\[18\]](https://www.bellingcat.com/tag/skripal/) [\[19\]](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/10/09/full-report-skripal-poisoning-suspect-dr-alexander-mishkin-hero-russia/)

Both are also nothing short of acts of Nuclear, Biological or Chemical (NBC) terrorism against a NATO member state.

As a result, heavy sanctions were placed upon members of the Russian government [\[20\]](https://www.rferl.org/a/u-s-state-department-details-new-skripal-related-sanctions-on-russia/30090270.html), their diplomats were expelled from many western nations [\[21\]](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/26/four-eu-states-set-to-expel-russian-diplomats-over-skripal-attack) and their seat as a permanent member of the G8 (Now G7) was stripped from them [\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Eight#Russia%E2%80%B2s_participation_suspension_(2014)).

Finally, over the course of the past decade, the Russian government has engaged in numerous, co-ordinated campaigns of disinformation against Western nations. These campaigns were characterised by General Philip Breedlove, the former NATO military commander as; ***""the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.""*** [\[23\]](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/).

This has frequently been downplayed by many, specifically American conservatives who see it as an attempt to de-legitimise the President and cast doubt on the results of the 2016 election, but also by the wider public who mistakenly believe that it is limited to ""a few Russian bots on Facebook posting memes"".

The actions the Russian government are engaged in, to undermine western institutions and sow discord among the general public, are complex and multi-faceted [\[24\]](https://globalsecurityreview.com/cold-war-2-0-russian-information-warfare/). To label them as simple ""election interference"" risks severely underestimating the gravity of the situation.

Russia is waging an information war, one that seeks to take advantage of what many have termed the ""Post-truth age"". Beyond simply seeking to interfere in Western elections, the techniques perfected by the GRU have sought to promote Russian geo-political interests and goals at home and abroad as well as to augment it's military capabilities on the battlefield. [\[25\]](https://www.rand.org/blog/2017/07/russian-information-warfare-a-reality-that-needs-a.html)

These attempts have been extensively documented [\[26\]](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf) [\[27\]](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/news/view/1490533-scale-of-russian-interference-in-european-democracy-revealed) [\[28\]](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/news/view/1037714-russian-influence-and-interference-measures-following-the-2017-uk-terrorist-attacks) [\[29\]](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/1791/179109.htm) and nowhere was the propaganda machine more evident than during the investigation into the downing of flight MH17 over Ukraine, when state sponsored news networks and influence groups like the [Internet Research Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency) went into overdrive to present numerous outlandish conspiracy theories about the event [\[30\]](https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/13/russias-reality-trolls-and-the-mh17-war-of-misinformation-buk-missile/), none of which were designed to convince, but rather to muddy the water enough so as to cast some level of doubt on to the official findings of the investigation which would directly link [\[31\]](https://www.bellingcat.com/tag/mh17/) Pro-Russian rebels using weaponry directly controlled by the Russian military to the attack.

...

**The TL;DR:** of all this, is that although China poses a long-term concern to US and western hegemony, their immediate military and geopolitical risk is less than that posed by Russia, rather, their threats should be seen in more of a geo-economic sense and thus unlikely to bring it into direct military confrontation with NATO.

This argument was well surmised by a recent paper published by the RAND corporation which explored this subject and drew similar conclusions. I'll link to this below if you're interested on reading further.

[https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE310.html](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE310.html)

>China is a peer competitor that wants to shape an international order that it can aspire to dominate. Both countries seek to alter the status quo, but **only Russia has attacked neighbouring states, annexed conquered territory, and supported insurgent forces seeking to detach yet more territory. Russia assassinates its opponents at home and abroad, interferes in foreign elections, subverts foreign democracies, and works to undermine European and Atlantic institutions.** In contrast, China's growing influence is based largely on more-positive measures: trade, investment, and development assistance. **These attributes make China a less immediate threat but a much greater long-term challenge.**",OperationIntegrity,geopolitics,21,12,1576524144,/r/geopolitics/comments/ebjqjl/russia_poses_a_greater_and_more_immediate_threat/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ebjqjl/russia_poses_a_greater_and_more_immediate_threat/,post_hanoi,china,2025-12-12 17:19:33,"Russia poses a greater and more immediate threat to NATO than China in the short term.

The Russian government vehemently denied at the time that these were Russian troops [\[8\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/putin-denies-russian-troops-are-in-ukraine-decrees-certain-deaths-secret/2015/05/28/9bb15092-0543-11e5-93f4-f24d4af7f97d_story.html), though Crimea itself has now been directly annexed into the Russian federation [\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation) \- and the territories in Eastern Ukraine now form the basis for the entirely fictional state of Novorossiya or ""New Russia"". [\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novorossiya_(confederation))

Both times, the Russian government claimed it's actions were an attempt to protect Russian speaking minorities in each of these countries [\[11\]](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-ethnic-russification-baltics-kazakhstan-soviet/25328281.html) and it has used this pretence to support it's claims in other regions too, notably in the Baltic states (where large numbers of Russian speakers reside) and Eastern Poland. The difference between Georgia/Ukraine and the Baltic states/Poland is that the latter, are fully fledged NATO members. Putin himself has nonetheless, privately expressed a desire to see these territories re-integrated. [\[12\]](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11106195/Putin-privately-threatened-to-invade-Poland-Romania-and-the-Baltic-states.html)

As well as their direct military interventions in non-NATO countries, Russia has for many years now engaged in military posturing and provocation against NATO. Frequently violating air and naval zones in so called [""buzzings""](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/russia-testing-nato-the-skies-21621) and conducting the largest military exercises in European history along it's western borders. Exercises that far exceed in size those conducted by NATO itself. [\[13\]](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/the-nato-russia-exercise-gap/)

The message is relatively clear. Russia is both capable of using - and fully prepared to use military force to reclaim territory or influence lost following the collapse of the Soviet Union and has invested considerably in the modernisation of it's conventional and nuclear forces to enable it to. [\[14\]](https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/2019-04-04-Dick.pdf)

In addition to the conventional military threat posed by Russia, their exists a more sinister and omnious threat to western interests through the willingness of the Russian government to use dangerous and prohibited substances to assassinate targets both at home and abroad.

In 2006, prominent critic of the Russian government and of Putin in particular, [Alexander Litvinenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Litvinenko) was murdered in London after consuming tea laced with [Polonium-210](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonium-210) a radioactive element that left a hazardous trail of material all over the English capital [\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexander_Litvinenko#Polonium_trails). 12 years later in 2018, former Russian spy now living in exile in the UK, [Sergei Skripal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Skripal) was himself targeted for assassination through the use of [Novichok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novichok_agent), a binary chemical weapon and nerve agent that once more left a hazardous trail around the town of Salisbury, UK which resulted in the poisoning of both Skripal and his daughter, two police officers who attended the crime scene and a further two individuals who found the discarded perfume bottle used to spray Novichok over the front door of Skripal's house, one of whom would later tragically die as a result. [\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Sergei_and_Yulia_Skripal)

Both instances have been tied directly to agents of the Russian GRU intelligence agency acting on orders from the highest levels of the Russian government. [\[17\]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/493860/The-Litvinenko-Inquiry-H-C-695-web.pdf) [\[18\]](https://www.bellingcat.com/tag/skripal/) [\[19\]](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/10/09/full-report-skripal-poisoning-suspect-dr-alexander-mishkin-hero-russia/)

Both are also nothing short of acts of Nuclear, Biological or Chemical (NBC) terrorism against a NATO member state.

As a result, heavy sanctions were placed upon members of the Russian government [\[20\]](https://www.rferl.org/a/u-s-state-department-details-new-skripal-related-sanctions-on-russia/30090270.html), their diplomats were expelled from many western nations [\[21\]](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/26/four-eu-states-set-to-expel-russian-diplomats-over-skripal-attack) and their seat as a permanent member of the G8 (Now G7) was stripped from them [\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Eight#Russia%E2%80%B2s_participation_suspension_(2014)).

Finally, over the course of the past decade, the Russian government has engaged in numerous, co-ordinated campaigns of disinformation against Western nations. These campaigns were characterised by General Philip Breedlove, the former NATO military commander as; ***""the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.""*** [\[23\]](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/).

This has frequently been downplayed by many, specifically American conservatives who see it as an attempt to de-legitimise the President and cast doubt on the results of the 2016 election, but also by the wider public who mistakenly believe that it is limited to ""a few Russian bots on Facebook posting memes"".

The actions the Russian government are engaged in, to undermine western institutions and sow discord among the general public, are complex and multi-faceted [\[24\]](https://globalsecurityreview.com/cold-war-2-0-russian-information-warfare/). To label them as simple ""election interference"" risks severely underestimating the gravity of the situation.

Russia is waging an information war, one that seeks to take advantage of what many have termed the ""Post-truth age"". Beyond simply seeking to interfere in Western elections, the techniques perfected by the GRU have sought to promote Russian geo-political interests and goals at home and abroad as well as to augment it's military capabilities on the battlefield. [\[25\]](https://www.rand.org/blog/2017/07/russian-information-warfare-a-reality-that-needs-a.html)

These attempts have been extensively documented [\[26\]](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf) [\[27\]](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/news/view/1490533-scale-of-russian-interference-in-european-democracy-revealed) [\[28\]](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/news/view/1037714-russian-influence-and-interference-measures-following-the-2017-uk-terrorist-attacks) [\[29\]](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/1791/179109.htm) and nowhere was the propaganda machine more evident than during the investigation into the downing of flight MH17 over Ukraine, when state sponsored news networks and influence groups like the [Internet Research Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency) went into overdrive to present numerous outlandish conspiracy theories about the event [\[30\]](https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/13/russias-reality-trolls-and-the-mh17-war-of-misinformation-buk-missile/), none of which were designed to convince, but rather to muddy the water enough so as to cast some level of doubt on to the official findings of the investigation which would directly link [\[31\]](https://www.bellingcat.com/tag/mh17/) Pro-Russian rebels using weaponry directly controlled by the Russian military to the attack.

...

**The TL;DR:** of all this, is that although China poses a long-term concern to US and western hegemony, their immediate military and geopolitical risk is less than that posed by Russia, rather, their threats should be seen in more of a geo-economic sense and thus unlikely to bring it into direct military confrontation with NATO.

This argument was well surmised by a recent paper published by the RAND corporation which explored this subject and drew similar conclusions. I'll link to this below if you're interested on reading further.

China’s rapidly developed aircraft carrier program – once expected to grow to a fleet of six or more ships in the next decade – may now be limited to four hulls by budgetary and technical constraints.

The PLA Navy has two aircraft carriers afloat, the Liaoning, a re-fitted ex-Soviet carrier, and an indigenously built evolution of the Liaoning design, the Type 001A that launched in 2018 and currently undergoing sea trials. A third larger, more advanced design, the Type 002, has been under construction since 2017 and a second of that type is planned. The South China Morning Post reports that those two Type 002 carriers will be completed, but that a planned fifth carrier and a future nuclear-powered carrier design have been put on hold.

This is a significant contraction of China’s carrier ambitions. Earlier this year, Chinese naval experts claimed that the PLA Navy would have at least six carrier groups by 2035 and that four of them would be led by nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. Chinese President Xi Jinping tasked the PLA to complete modernization by 2035.

But internal military sources told the SCMP that engineers were struggling to overcome technical challenges with the Type 002 and also lacked the expertise to translate its experience with nuclear-powered submarines to propel a new nuclear-powered aircraft carrier design. “There is no plan to build more aircraft carriers,” the source said.

If this is true, it appears to have been a rapid change in the PLA Navy’s strategic direction. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a U.S. think tank, procured commercial satellite images earlier this year that show China has added massive new shipbuilding infrastructure to the facilities currently building the Type 002 carrier. A CSIS expert told Reuters that “It is hard to imagine all this is being done for just one ship. This looks more like a specialized space for carriers and or other larger vessels.”

China’s carrier ambitions, and the new shipbuilding infrastructure that appears to have been built to support that ambition, may have been products of a more hopeful strategic environment and more generous economic situation. Over the summer, military sources told the South China Morning Post that the PLA Navy was reconsidering its shipbuilding plans in light of China’s slowing economy and the massive costs associated with not only building a large modern fleet, but operating and maintaining it. These decisions would not just affect aircraft carriers, but China’s advanced new destroyers and amphibious assault ships as well.

The spiraling costs of China’s new fleet highlights the uncertain strategic return on its investment. Aircraft carriers are only as effective as the aircraft that can take off from it, and China faces even greater technical barriers to building advanced, next-generation carrier aircraft than it does making the carriers work for them to take off from. “China may need 10 to 20 years to develop a new generation of carrier-based warplanes, meaning the J-15 is likely to be the main warhorse for some time, despite it still having engine and flight control problems,” once source told the SCMP. Without new aircraft, the combat capability of China’s carrier fleet will remain at a significant disadvantage to the United States’.

Further, with the Liaoning and first Type 002, half of China’s carrier fleet will also be beset by so-called “first-in-class problems,” technical and engineering issues that aren’t apparent in new designs until the ships begin to be operated. Some of these problems can never be completely corrected, leading to the first ships of new designs having more limited capability than subsequent ships of the same design. For these reasons, the PLA Navy originally envisioned Liaoning filling only training and testing roles, not an operational combat one.

ADVERTISEMENT

But If China’s carrier fleet is ultimately limited to only four hulls, having one relegated exclusively to training significantly reduces its capacity to conduct operations. As a result, the PLA Navy says that it is upgrading the Liaoning to be able to serve some combat role. In April, senior officers on the Liaoning told Chinese state media that “The Liaoning is shifting from a training and test ship to a combat ship. I believe this process is going faster and faster, and we will achieve our goal very soon.”

China may also be coming to terms with the challenges that its carrier fleet would face operating within the so-called first island chain. Southeast Asian navies have been rapidly expanding and modernizing their submarine fleets. Singapore is procuring four advanced submarines from Germany, Indonesia is buying and indigenously assembling a new submarine fleet from South Korea, and Vietnam has been procuring a fleet of advanced Russian submarines.

Armed with modern torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, these submarines could severely limit the ability of China’s aircraft carriers to operate freely in the South China Sea in a conflict. Elsewhere in the western Pacific, South Korea and Japan both produce advanced indigenous submarines, and Taiwan is developing its own domestic submarine program. And outside the first island chain, China’s carriers would have to face the United States’ premier nuclear-powered and modernizing submarine fleet.

Faced with greater technical challenges and lower operational effectiveness than expected, an increasingly threatening operating environment, spiraling costs, and a slowing economy, China’s possible decision to truncate it aircraft carrier fleet looks less surprising and more like strategic prudence.",NineteenEighty9,geopolitics,3,15,1575471228,/r/geopolitics/comments/e60ck1/technical_problems_slowing_economy_cut_chinas/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/e60ck1/technical_problems_slowing_economy_cut_chinas/,post_hanoi,china,2025-12-12 17:19:33,"Technical Problems, Slowing Economy Cut China’s Carrier Ambitions Plans to build more than four aircraft carriers apparently put on hold. https://thediplomat.com/2019/12/technical-problems-slowing-economy-cut-chinas-carrier-ambitions/

e3az9l,"The missing context of ""how financially important is Hong Kong to China?""","Over the last few months, in threads covering the HK issue in this sub and others, individuals have debated over how ""important"" Hong Kong is to China, usually in terms of how much China depends on Hong Kong for its economic prosperity. Individuals on one side of the argument point out the degree to which China depends on HK as a point for Chinese money and companies to transfer through and interact with the rest of the world -- while individuals on the other side of the argument have suggested HK is much smaller in size relative to China now than 20 years ago or that China has potential alternatives to HK that can be developed as financial centres.

I think the various comments I've seen on both sides of this argument -- with the caveat that I obviously haven't read every comment about this matter -- seem to overlook one rather important contextual point, which is that HK's financial or economic importance to China is *relative* to HK's historical and cultural importance to China.

What I mean by this of course, is that HK is arguably the first significant ""loss"" of territory and part of the first ""process"" (i.e.: the Opium War and the treaty/ies which followed) that China experienced of the ""century of humiliation"" whereby China experienced significant losses of sovereignty, territory, wealth and security, causing significant cultural and historical trauma. (I wrote an [answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/dup6s8/why_is_the_century_of_humiliation_such_a_huge/f77mod6/?context=3) to a question asked by someone a while back about the importance of the ""century of humiliation"", which may be relevant here)

By now I think most people talking about the HK issue today are least superficially familiar with the political process that led up to the handover of HK from the UK to China, and roughly aware of the terms which were tenuously agreed upon between China and the UK at the time. Most of the major focus in recent years has been the degree of autonomy HK experiences, and the issue of ""universal suffrage"". But I believe the cultural and historical motivations on which China sought to ""return"" HK to China in the 20th century (and which culminated in the 1997 handover), was very much a desire to seek ""closure"" or ""catharsis"" for what was perceived as one of the first and most symbolic unjust ""losses"" of the tumultuous and damaging 19th-20th century period. From the Chinese side, I believe that giving HK 50 years of autonomy from 1997 to 2047, was made with the ultimate goal (either in 2047 specifically, or beyond) of reintegrating HK into China proper and to erase the effects of the Opium War and to ""close the chapter"" from associated losses of that initial ""first injustice"" of the century of humiliation. This isn't to say that HK doesn't have any physical/territorial or economic value, but I do think the biggest reason why China is committed to HK is because of the historical and cultural grievance.

With the above context in mind, I believe that the question of ""how financially important is Hong Kong to China"" should really be expanded as ""*how financially important is Hong Kong to China, given Hong Kong's territorial/sovereignty status is likely perceived by China as a historical grievance and a product of unjust foreign aggression that needs reintegration to attain closure*"".

That extra context is lengthy, but IMO it is essential if one wants to discuss the way in which China may manage the HK situation. So, if one wants to consider how China may respond to recent US legislative pressure or other potential foreign pressure applied on HK's financial status, I think it's vital to look at how that pressure is weighed up against China's longer term goal of reintegrating HK into China proper and seeking closure of HK as a historical grievance.

&#x200B;

====

I also note that some people have suggested the reason China hasn't intervened with its military or paramilitary forces in HK is because of the foreign pressure that will be applied on HK as a financial conduit for China.

1. I think some people overestimate China's ""trigger-happy-ness,"" with at least some of those impressions being based on what they think China's response to the Tiananmen protests in 1989 was like.
2. Greatly underestimating the threshold with which China perceives events in HK as requiring physical, official mainland intervention would be.
3. Finally, China should understand by now, that the strategy and goal of the black shirts is to use escalating marginal violence to provoke an ""excessive"" Chinese response to try to exact larger scale foreign pressure against China proper, which China likely sees as not worth the little benefit that direct intervention could bring at this stage.",PLArealtalk,geopolitics,476,93,1575009246,/r/geopolitics/comments/e3az9l/the_missing_context_of_how_financially_important/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/e3az9l/the_missing_context_of_how_financially_important/,post_hanoi,china,2025-12-12 17:19:33,"The missing context of ""how financially important is Hong Kong to China?""

On one hand, this is an infringement on the sovereignty of Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam and the Philippines, which also have claims on parts of the South China Sea. The Hague had also ruled the Chinese claim over virtually the whole sea as illegal. 

However, from a historical perspective, rising great powers have always had their own spheres of influence. For example the rising USA in the late 19th century laid claims over the influence of the Americas through the Monroe Doctrine, and used gunboat diplomacy and imperialist means to further their own interests in the Western Hemisphere, e.g. helping Panama secede from Columbia to build the Panama Canal.

cws0r3,How Residues of Chinese Imperial Worldview Still Impact Modern China Strategic Toolkit,"In the previous post titled [Jaw-Jaw: China’s Great Power Disease (Edward Luttwak)](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/csc138/jawjaw_chinas_great_power_disease_edward_luttwak/) I  went through Edward Luttwak's his book, which in the post dealt mainly with who Luttwak's perceived was the  Chinese world view and cognitive biases impact their perception of the strategic reality.   The problem with Luttwak while he has a decent understanding of basic principles behind China's Imperial worldview, but not sufficient enough to explain different approaches throughout China's history, even during the same dynasty.  Secondly, he  doesn't realize the Chinese, including ethnic Han and conquest dynasties (Yuan and Qing)  used non-Chinese concepts when dealing with non-Han subjects and nations if they felt it was advantageous,

In this post, I will first examine some of the basic principles behind China's worldview in the Imperial past,This section will cover concepts such as Tianxia-Guojia, Concept of Hua-Yi,, Mandate of Heaven.   Lastly, I will examine five areas of statecraft - observing an opponent, alliances, building ""walls"",  use of commercial tools and treaties within the context of the first section.

**E.**  **POLITICAL OVER THE COMMERCIAL**

**E1, CHINESE THE MATERIALIST**

**E2.** **DOMINANCE OF COMMERCE**

**G.** **CHANGING EQUILIBRIUM AND TREATIES**

**H. CONCLUSION**

Post 1949 leaders, like their Imperial counterparts, used a varied toolkit to guide and justify their actions. Chinese leaders take  concepts and themes from Imperial China, experience of the Soviet Union, Imperial Japan and the West.  Different leaders use different time periods and interpretations of history to frame an issue.

Secondly, Imperial Chinese rulers were pragmatist, and placed realpolitik above Confucianism. They had no problem dealing with non-Confucian polity like the steppe nomads as equals even on paper when ti was necessary, [Notions of Confucian benevolence given a dominate role on foreign policy would have amused Imperial Chinese rulers.](https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article/8/2/197/353237)

>Emperor Xuan of the Han dynasty (Xuandi, 73–49 BC). Scolding his son (the future emperor Yuan) for suggesting he employ more Confucian officials in key positions, Emperor Xuan poignantly pointed out that the Han regime had always used a combination of *ba* (霸) and *wang* (王) (i.e., coercion and humaneness) in statecraft.

To the dismay of Confucian scholars like Zhu Xi (1130-1200) the great synthesizer and founder of Song neo-Confucianism, for example, lamented that the Confucian Sage Way had not ruled the world for a single day since the classical age of Confucius and Mencius.

Lastly, I find this relevant for today, because the ""war"" with the US is economic and psychological-political, and most of China's tools during Imperial times were economic and political., not military and technological. When her main rivals the Steppe nomads gained the upper hand it was because political and economic factors..

# A. TIANXIA, HUA-YI DISTINCTION AND MANDATE OF HEAVEN

**A1. TIANXIA (**[天下](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%A4%A9%E4%B8%8B)) **AND GUOJIA (國家)**

Tianxia means all under heaven **(** [天下](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%A4%A9%E4%B8%8B) ) and is used to describe entire geographic world or the metaphysical world were human inhabit.  Its a universal concept.

[Guojia (國家) means state, country or better description would be homeland](http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/blogs/languagesofsecurity/2011/05/27/chinese-nation/). 國 means states or country with borders. The box represents the borders.  家 means home or family.  In the PRC does not regard itself official as a nation state, but a multinational state consisting or 56 officially recognized ethnic groups.

[Here is a description on the relationship between Tianxia and Guojia](https://u.osu.edu/mclc/2018/10/18/xu-jilin-the-new-tianxia/)

>The American sinologist Joseph Levenson (1920-1969) argued that in China’s early history, “the notion of the ‘state’ referred to a structure of power, while the notion of *tianxia* pointed to a structure of values.”\[3\]  As a value system, *tianxia* was a set of civilizational principles with a corresponding institutional system. The Ming dynasty scholar Gu Yanwu 顾炎武 (1613-1682) distinguished between “the loss of the state and the loss of *tianxia*.” Here, the state was merely the political order of the dynasty, while *tianxia* was a civilizational order with universal application. It referred not only to a particular dynasty or state, but above all to eternal, absolute, and universal values. The state could be destroyed, but *tianxia* could not. Otherwise humanity would devour itself, disappearing into a Hobbesian jungle.... This is because China’s civilizational tradition was not nationalistic, but rather grounded in *tianxia*, whose values were universal and humanistic rather than particular.

For most of Chinese history Tianxia was a principle, and Chinese rulers were more concerned with affairs of state (國家).  The exercise of Tianxia depended on circumstance.  During the Early Ming, Zheng He's voyages could be seen as China exercising and promoting Tianxia. However, after the Tumu Crisis of 1449, when the Ming Emperor  [Yingzong ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yingzong_of_Ming) was captured by the Mongols, Ming assumed a largely defensive policy and aimed at protecting the state. [One could see it in the Early Ming](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/35355/1/Christopher%20Eirkson%20-%20ETD.pdf) (1389)

>The earliest map we have from the Ming era, the fifteen-foot wide silk scroll Da Ming Hunyi Tu (大明混一圖, the Amalgamated Map of the Great Ming), originated in the late fourteenth century. It is strikingly different from its Song predecessors, and more closely resembles the Yuan grid map in its extent and format.258 It depicts not only what has traditionally been called “Inner China,” but the entirety of Eurasia, as well as Japan and some Southeast Asian islands, in a distorted yet recognizable form. Of the features depicted on the map, two are particularly relevant for our discussion. First, the map places greater territorial emphasis on regions once governed by the Mongols; and second, it depicts no walls or fortifications in northern China  (p118)

[By the mid-Ming (1500 AD), the map was more confined](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/35355/1/Christopher%20Eirkson%20-%20ETD.pdf)

>The Guang Yu Tu 广與图, like the Amalgamated Map, was based on Zhu Siben’s nonextant Yuditu, suggesting that it was primarily concerned with depicting the regions inside China, but the stark difference between how each represents frontier regions suggests a dramatically different way of thinking about the Eurasian world at large and the Ming empire’s place within it. The Guang Yu Tu also omits many place names for frontier regions in favour of more labels within China, despite the fact that the Amalgamated Map indicates Ming court elites had access to geographical information about Eurasia.274 The separation between the Ming empire and the steppe and the willingness to omit foreign place names, according to Luo Hongxian’s representation, was one willed by Heaven and reinforced by man.

In post 1949 China, under Mao Zedong China was concerned with bringing about Communism, which could be see as a modern version Tianxia. In contrast, Deng and other post-Mao leaders were more concerned with the Chinese state.  However, that is starting to change with Xi Jinping concept of Com[munity of Common Destiny](https://thediplomat.com/2017/10/the-community-of-common-destiny-in-xi-jinpings-new-era/).

**NOTE:** My opinion is  the Tang Dynasty was the last dynasty truly embodying Tianxia. It cosmopolitan and universal. [The borders of its frontier territories were fluid with mobile defensives, with the Tang willing to surrender territory it could hold. By the Song Dynasty, borders became more fixed and rigid. ](https://www.amazon.com/Tang-China-Multi-Polar-Asia-Diplomacy/dp/0824872843)

**A2. HUA-YI DISTINCTION**

China's dealings with the outside world can be linked to Hua-yI distinction . With Hua being Chinese, Yi being barbarians. / outsider  In Northern China context, it meant Hua meant sedentary, while Yi meant nomadic  A Yi could become Hua by adopting Hua customs and culture, and the Hua can become Yi. In the  In most cases and time periods, tha Hua are considered superior to the Yi. However, at some time period and among some writers, the two groups are different, but equal.

The general belief in China the process of cultural transmission was one way from Chinese to barbarian, and if there was any contributions they didn't have to do with things that required ""intellect"" like war, food or clothing.  This belief has existed until the Europeans undermined it in the 19th century.  According to new historiography the distinction wasn't so clear. The [founder of the Tang Dynasty, Li Yang during he struggles against the Sui Dynasty, became a vassal of the Turks, and even took a Turkic title, to win over their military support.](https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article/8/2/197/353237) The first emperor of the Ming, Hongwu was influenced by the Mongols, because Mongol rule was the only type of rule he had lived under.  Even though he declared he would purge China of Mongol influences and restore the Song, he kept the Mongol postal system and used Mongol maps, adopted more autocratic Mongol governing principles **(Timothy Brooks, Troubled Empire** **p85-100**)

In terms of people, the interaction occurred both ways, even though the transition from Hua to Yi has negative connoations and less well known. In deep Southern provinces like Guangdong and Guangxi, you have people who are consider themselves Han Chinese, but when DNA test were done, they had very little Han Chinese genetic markers. Meaning assimilation was both cultural and genetic. However, throughout Chinese history you had Han Chinese who became nomads. During Liao Dynasty (916-1125)  under the nomadic Khitans, which ruled parts of Northern China, many Han Chinese living in those areas had become ""Khitanized"".  [They adopted Khitan burial rites](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.691.2626&rep=rep1&type=pdf).   The divisions only become more racialized under the Mongol Yuan, when Hua meant Han Chinese, and the term Han Chinese was officially used.

The Hua-Yi concept is important, because its the key principle between as to what extent China's policy toward foreigners is inclusive and exclusive. Secondly, it frames the debate of Chinese nationality based on blood or culture, which influences the debate on Hong Kong, Taiwan, how China deals with minorities and overseas Chinese.

China foreign policy can be divided into exclusivist or inclusivist as [Arthur Waldron](https://www.history.upenn.edu/people/faculty/arthur-waldron) argued in his assessment of Ming-Mongol relations of the [15-16th century](https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article/8/2/197/353237).

>Waldron reveals a Ming foreign policy approach under a condition of extreme conflict between the Chinese and the Mongols, one that he variously characterizes as culturalist, moralistic, exclusive, xenophobic, and inflexible. This is contrasted with an opposing approach described as cosmopolitan, inclusive, rational, pragmatic, and flexible

The debate here is whether or not Confucianism is 1) As Waldron argues is exclusive from the beginning, and its only because of pragmatic approach by the rulers that is inclusive 2) Is it inclusive. but only became exclusive as a result of negative experience dealing with foreigners like the [An Lushan Rebellion](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-an-lushan-rebellion-195114) (755-763), the Mongol Invasion (1205-1279) and Century of Humiliation 3) [Was inclusive until the rise of neo-Confucianism during the Song Dynasty](https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article/8/2/197/353237).  At the moment in China you are dealing with exclusive foreign policy with some inclusive elements.

Chinese identity is based on both blood and culture, and this is what distinguishes China from East Asian neighbor Japan and Korea, which are based largely on blood. Many Chinese don't know how different they are to their East Asian neighbors. [For example,in China  ethnic Koreans are given Chinese citizenship on birth; whereas, few ethnic Han Chinese have South Korean citizenship despite having lived their for 3-4 generations.](http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/152641.html) The South  Koreans make it very difficult for them to do so.

[As the Australian writer and diplomat said, the Japanese are tribal, while the Chinese, like Westerners, are dogmatic](http://gregoryclark.net/lifestory/page21/page21.html).  This culturalist definition of identity, that by the late 19th century, when Confucianism had become intertwined with Chinese elite identity made it reform difficult. Because Western idea undermine the Confucian hierarchy of ideas that they based their legitimacy on.  In contrast, the Japanese with their tribal identity, the transition was much easier.

Because Chinese nationalism is largely cultural, propaganda and ""indoctrination"" is used to shape the identity. This isn't unique to China, a more extreme example is Malay cultural identity in Malaysia, That is why Chinese Communist  propaganda and trying to shape's someone mind was more important in China than in the Soviet Union. Its why you see the Chinese attempt to ""sinocize"" Uighur society, which is something the Soviet weren't too concerned with.

**A3. MANDATE OF HEAVEN**

The mandate of heaven is most a key source of the instability of Imperial China. This concept carries over into modern China, by adding to the culture of paranoia.

>The [**Mandate of Heaven**](https://www.ancient.eu/Mandate_of_Heaven/) (*Tianming*), also known as Heaven’s Mandate, was the divine source of authority and the right to rule of [**China**](https://www.ancient.eu/china/)’s early kings and emperors. The ancient god or divine force known as Heaven or Sky had selected this particular individual to rule on its behalf on earth. An important element of the mandate was that although the ruler had been given great power he also had a moral obligation to use it for the good of his people, if he did not then his state would suffer terrible disasters and he would lose the right to govern.   

The Mandate of Heaven was a key source of instability in Imperial China, because it removes ""formal"" barriers to seizing power. Any man (or even women) can become Emperor, which increases the number of usurpers markedly.  In feudal Europe, one had to establish a hereditary claim to the throne. [This was made worse after the fall of the Tang, when aristocratic families that dominated political life in China from Han Dynasty had been killed or suffered reduced circumstances during the transition from Tang to Song.](https://orias.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/2010-tackett-summary.pdf) It was one reason why the Song built up the Confucian bureaucracy.  During the Song, Song rulers were deeply paranoid about loyalty of the Song military, and this hampered military effectiveness against the barbarian kingdoms (Liao and Jin).  Interestingly the last ethnic Han dynasty, the Ming, was founded by a commoner.

When the Japanese adopted the [Taiho Code in 703](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Taiho-code) from the Tang Dynasty, two key elements they left out.  The first was in official position in Japan were determined also class, not merit alone.  Secondly, the Japanese rejected the Mandate of Heaven, believing it derived from Imperial descent, not righteousness as a ruler.

Lastly, the Mandate of Heaven combined with universality of Tianxia and the notion of Hua can become Yi, means even non-Han Chinese can claim the Mandate of Heaven, as shown by Kublai Khan (Yuan) and Nurachi (Qing).  When the Mongols tried to invade Japan (1274-1281), the response of the Japanese nobility was to ban together to resist the foreign invader, because they had inter connected family and kin ties to each other. In contrast, a Chinese general of the Song who risen from the ranks most likely had much fewer familial ties connecting him with the ""establishment"".  During the Mongol invasion of the Song many Song general and troops defected to the Mongols, while in  Japan it was unheard of.

# B. BARBARIAN HANDLING AND ENCOUNTERS WITH DONALD J TRUMP

How China conducts interference operations is to focus on individuals. As this article points out [""playing the man"" operations](https://warontherocks.com/2018/01/contrasting-chinas-russias-influence-operations/)

>The Chinese, however, seem to focus on individuals rather than effects, on shaping the personal context rather than operational tricks. It is person-to-person relationships that carry the weight of Chinese information operations. Many of China’s first-generation diplomats and negotiators — including Zhou Enlai, Wu Xiuquan, Li Kenong, Xiong Xianghui, Liao Chengzhi, and many others — worked for some time as intelligence officers. For example, Li Kenong was Beijing’s chief negotiator at the Panmunjom talks with the United Nations during the Korean War and a vice foreign minister. His party career, however, began in intelligence where he was one of the “[Three Heroes of the Dragon’s Lair](https://jamestown.org/program/shriver-case-highlights-traditional-chinese-espionage/)” and rose [to become a deputy director of the party’s intelligence service](http://www.qntsw.com/lishi/20161225/6388.html).

One possible explanation for this individual focused operations, which also extends to how it deals with leaders of respective countries, is China's tributary relations which couched in personal terms between sovereign and sovereign, but more importantly her long involvement with the Steppe nomads.  For much of the last 1000 years, the biggest threat to China was a charismatic leader uniting and organizing the steppe nomads into invading China. This happened twice, with Genghis Khan and Nurhaci, the founder and ruler of the Manchus.  However,  there were numerous and less successful leaders the Chinese manage to defeat, eliminate or frustrate.

You see this replicated in modern times with China dealing with Rizak Najib in Malaysia, Rodrigo Duterte in Philippines. With Donald Trump, some writers have commented that Chinese tried to use the same tactics on Trump like approving his trademarks in China, trying to reach out personally to him etc. However,  I think the Chinese did this to establish a good working relationship with Trump, and were open minded about Trump in the beginning.  The problem in Chinese leaders get most of the advice of the US through Wall Street elites and the establishment. If the Western media is producing articles like  [Donald Trump, Barbarian Emperor](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/04/donald-trump-barbarian-emperor-japan-china-defense/).  [Opinion | Donald Trump, Barbarian at the Debate](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/opinion/donald-trump-barbarian-at-the-debate.html). [Trump the Barbarian](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-the-barbarian_b_8149866),  [How Republican mandarins will try to civilize Trump the barbarian](https://theweek.com/articles/622572/how-republican-mandarins-try-civilize-trump-barbarian),  [Don't expect America's media to stop barbarian Donald Trump.](https://www.smh.com.au/world/dont-expect-americas-media-to-stop-barbarian-donald-trump-heres-why-20160729-gqgo8w.html), [Trump the Barbarian - Baltimore Sun](https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/op-ed/bs-ed-trump-coulter-20150901-story.html) and  [Editorial: Vote for Clinton and against the barbarian at the gate](https://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/editorial-vote-clinton-against-barbarian-at-gate/) how do you expect the Chinese leadership to think.

# C. RISE OF CONFUCIANIST, HEQIN MARRIAGE AND ALLIANCES

One of the most significant factors in the China'a foreign relations was the rise of Confucianist through the Imperial Examination System.  The imperial examination system we normally associate with Imperial China, came  during the Sui Dynasty from 581-618 AD, and was  expanded during the Tang Dynasty particularly under Empress Wu Zerian. Besides providing capable administrators, the reasons were also political 1) To create a group of elites loyal to the Emperor without a local base of support like the hereditary nobles. 2) To bind various parts of the Empire together under one ideological umbrella. By the Northern Song Dynasty almost all higher ranking officials got their positions through the examination system.   There were differing opinions about foreign policy, with some officials arguing for a more open policy, you hear fewer such voices as you progress in to Ming and later on the Qing. The dangers of such a system compared to hereditary oligarchy like Japan during the Meiji restoration is you are more likely to develop group think.  The education background of the Japanese nobility who made up vanguard of the Meiji restoration was more eclectic  than the Qing officials during the same period. Ib Qing China, openness and reform was seen as iconclaust, whereas in Japan it was a faction

**C1. HEQIN MARRIAGES**

[The increasing dominance of Confucianism from the Song onward more serious impact was the abandonment of the policy of Heqin (marriage alliance with barbarian kingdoms) by the Song.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heqin#Sui_Dynasty) Neither the Song or Ming Dynasty (the last ethnic Han dynasty) that followed engaged in marriages alliances with steppe nomads.  Prior to the Song, dynasties made extensive use of the Heqin.  Under the Tang Dynasty there were 21 marriage alliances with bordering states (Tuyuhun, the [Tibetan Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Empire), the [Khitans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khitan_people) and the allied [Kumo Xi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumo_Xi), the [Uyghur Khaganate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_Khaganate), and [Nanzhao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanzhao)).

Confucian scholars were opposed to the heqin dating as far back to the Han Dynasty, because it was humiliating and violated the Confucian principle of hierarchy **(Harmony and War: Confucian Culture and Chinese Power Politics Yuan-kang Wang)**.  During the relations with the Song, the Liao (Khitan) requested a Heqin, but the Song refused, referring to keep nominal kinship and increase the tribute. Confucian advisors said it would be too humiliating.  This question popped up again when the Mongols during  [Tumu Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumu_Crisis)  on 1449  suggested the captured Ming Emperor, Yingzong, marry a Mongol princess. The Ming refused.

While eliminating its use wasn't fatal, it removed a key tool in steppe politics for the Chinese. The tributes and treaties wasn't enough to endear trust.   It was the beginning of solidifying divisions between Hua (Han Chinese)  and Yi (Barbarians).  This would become important during the decades leading to the Manchu conquest of China. From the early 1600s, the Ming used bribes to pit Mongols clans against the Manchus,  [Nurhaci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurhaci) and his son, Hong Taiji, made extensive marriages alliances with Mongols clans which helped mitigate against this.  [Even when a Mongol tribe went against the Manchus, pre-existing marriage alliance would serve as a way bring the sides together once a conflict had died down.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl1-vop7ipY&t=32m24s)

**NOTE:** The retreat from Steppe affairs was gradual and it begun in the Tang Dynasty after An Lushan rebellion which resulted in the loss of Xinjiang. With the loss of Xinjiang, China lost a source of  horses and mounter archers. Secondly, she also lost a key platform in steppe politics.

**C2. ALLIANCES**

As described in the paper[Xi’s Vision for Transforming Global Governance: A Strategic Challenge for Washington and Its Allies](https://tnsr.org/2018/11/xis-vision-for-transforming-global-governance-a-strategic-challenge-for-washington-and-its-allies/)

>President Jiang Zemin’s “new security concept” in the late 1990s echoed the Five Principles and rejected the “old security concept based on military alliances and build-up of armaments.”[**7**](https://tnsr.org/2018/11/xis-vision-for-transforming-global-governance-a-strategic-challenge-for-washington-and-its-allies/#_ftn7) In a similar vein, President Hu proposed building a “harmonious world” in a 2005 speech to the United Nations. Hu affirmed his predecessors’ concepts and called for reforms to give developing countries a greater voice in global governance.[**8**](https://tnsr.org/2018/11/xis-vision-for-transforming-global-governance-a-strategic-challenge-for-washington-and-its-allies/#_ftn8) Each of these proposals reflects long-standing Chinese objections to features of the current international order, including U.S.-led security alliances, military superpower, and democratic norms.

However, Modern China's reluctance is as much historical and cultural, as well as geopolitical.    Although its getting better, since the founding of the PRC, maintaining and keeping alliances have been a struggle. Within 17 years of the founding of the People's Republic, China was isolated from both the Western and Eastern Bloc. This earlier ineptitude was exacerbated  by the inexperience and ideologicalization of the PRC diplomatic corp in the 1950-60s.  [China was very lucky Nixon was motivated by tactical considerations](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/445507-henry-kissinger-is-still-brilliant-and-still-wrong-about-china) when he met Mao.

Firstly, when it comes to bilateral alliances or partnership, China's role has often be  passive and defensive, while the other partner would do most of the heavy lifting with China playing support.  In modern times you see this with China - Pakistan vs India, China-Cambodia vs Vietnam (USSR - Vietnam vs China), China - US vs USSR (In the 1970-80s), China - Russia vs US. In the Imperial era you clearly see this China- Korea vs Japan (Tang and Ming Dynasty). Sometimes, China gets dragged into conflicts by this more active partner like with the China-Cambodia vs Vietnam between 1975-79.  (Brantley Womack, Asymmetry and Systemic Misconception: China, Vietnam and Cambodia during the 1970s)

This inexperience with alliances also extend to when it comes to undermining alliances.  Often its better to keep a weak opposing alliance, than break it altogether. For example, the weakness as ASEAN as alliance is as Lee Kuan Yew said is its combination of two strategically incompatible regions, Mainland SEA and Maritime SEA. Mainland SEA will naturally gravitate toward China, while Maritime SEA is more independent. [When China sent three naval incursions into Indonesia's Natuna EEZ in 2016](https://thediplomat.com/2016/06/a-third-2016-natuna-stand-off-highlights-growing-indonesia-china-tensions/), the Indonesians decided it would be necessary to find stronger partners.  [Before Indonesia wasted a lot of diplomatic energy trying to hold ASEAN together](http://www.ciis.org.cn/english/2012-12/31/content_5638110.htm).  From 2016 onward, the Indonesians sought to strength both economic and military ties with both [Australia](https://dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/not-yet-in-force/iacepa/pages/indonesia-australia-comprehensive-economic-partnership-agreement.aspx) and [India](https://www.eurasiareview.com/24062018-india-indonesia-and-sabang-port-a-game-changer-analysis/).

# D. THE GREAT WALL AND THE ART OF BUILDING WALLS

The Great Wall we know today, or Ming Great Wall, was built / reinforced as a result of the of Tumu Crisis of 1449. Prior to this, dynasties built fortifications in sections of the Northern Steppe to defend against northern tribes These walls also served as offensive platform. Wall construction ebbed and flowed depending on the Dynasty. Both the Tang and Song didn't build any notable additions to these walls.  Even during the early Ming, Emperor Yong le had ordered the outer garrisons that served as a the first line of defense against nomadic attacks dismantled.

[Tumu Crisis](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/35355/1/Christopher%20Eirkson%20-%20ETD.pdf) came about when the Ming Emperor  [Yingzong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yingzong_of_Ming) was captured by a Mongol force during an expedition beyond the Wall.  This event symbolized the military weakness of Yuan.  Prior to this the Ming still had pretense of emulating the Yuan, even Zheng Ho treasure fleets could be seen in this light.  Here is an interesting observation of maps

>[The Da Ming Hunyi Tu’s lack of a clear divide, either man-made or natural, between China and the steppe indicates that early Ming rulers maintained an open vision of empire and intended to reconstitute the old Yuan polity. Song maps, and later Ming maps, consistently separate China and the steppe with walls or geographic features like deserts.](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/35355/1/Christopher%20Eirkson%20-%20ETD.pdf)

After the Tumu affair, one sees a increased wall building, and the Great Wall, becomes the Ming centerpiece for barbarian handling on the steppes.

The obsession with building walls, has carried over into modern China. The the Great Firewall, Wall of Capital Controls and militarization of the Spratly, should be seen as walls to protect China. The biggest difference was Ming rulers knew once they committed to building a ""wall"" it would meaning given up their engagement on expansion into the Steppe.

How can China take a more prominent role in the world, when its internet is walled off from the rest of the world? The Chinese government spends money to buy anti-protestors ads on Facebook and Twitter, yet bans them from operating in China. It wants the Yuan to be equal footing with the Dollar and Euro, all the while maintaining capital controls.

# E. COMMERCIAL VS POLITICAL

The one aspect the Chinese Communist Party shares with the Confucius, is the commercial interest are subordinate to the political. The PRC uses economic clout to gain strategic advantage.

The reason why Henry Kissinger got on well with the Chinese officialdom was they both believed commercial interest should be subordinate to the geopolitical / strategic. From 1949-2016, the West took this approach, because for majority of the time China's economy was small. However, anyone who believes that geopolitical  concerns can outweigh the commercial  is going against 500 years of Chinese relations with the outside world, where economics dominates the political. This is particularly true of the US.  China should count itself very lucky this state of affairs lasted this long.

**E1. CHINESE THE MATERIALIST**

From the Song Dynasty onward until 1911, Chinese statecraft increasingly resorted to monetary methods When foreign countries paid tribute to China, it was actually an excuse to conduct trade. Under the Song, the Chinese paid both the Liao and the Jin tributes. During the Ming they would pay one Mongol tribe to side with them in a fight against other tribes

There is this belief with regards to China relations with South Korea and Japan, or between China and Taiwan, that money can buy acceptance and can eventually mellow long standing grievances. It can't, unless those issues are addressed directly. [China, South Korea and Japan don't have an FTA, despite the FTA first being proposed in 2001](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2165260/china-japan-and-south-korea-aim-speed-talks-free-trade).  While Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia do. The historical tensions between these three countries is just as bad as in Northeast Asia.  In the last 15 years, Cambodia and Thailand have border skirmishes, ethnic Vietnamese have been attacked in Cambodia and there have been anti-Thai riots in Cambodia. However. relations quickly return to normal. Where as in Northeast Asia, a small incident can derail relations for 5-6 years.  The reason for this is the underlying historical issues in Northeast Asia haven't been resolved.

The same applies for China and Taiwan. [The incident that gave birth to many young Hong Kong activist like Joshua Wong was attempts by the Hong Kong government to introduced patriotic education in 2011, when Wong was only 14.](https://www.cnn.com/2012/07/30/world/asia/hong-kong-national-education-controversy/index.html) China couldn't get Hong Kongers to accept ""patriotic education"", who prior to the last 8 years were very apolitical.  What do you expect would happen in Taiwan, where people are actually taught an opposing narrative to what the CPC teach, How can you expect to get descendants of people who fought under the KMT to accept the CPC version of Second Sino Japanese War? Basically it will be the equivalent of serving a turd at the family alter.  [Ma Yingjeou made a speech urging China to accept historical reality.](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taiwans-president-ma-ying-jeou-remembers-nationalist-victory-in-sino-japan-war)

**E2. DOMINANCE OF COMMERCE**

Historically both India and China's role in producing goods utilizing its specialization of labor resulting from their vast populations. Both India and China were much more populous than the rest of the world, particularly their neighbors in Southeast Asia.  Prior to the Song Dynasty trade with China, usually meant foreign traders going to China to trade.  Starting from the Song Dynasty onward, Chinese traders increasingly started to venture outward bringing Chinese goods to foreign markets, and foreign goods back to China.

[During the Ming and Qing Dynasty there was the constant debate as to how open China should be to foreign trade.](https://www.amazon.com/Troubled-Empire-Dynasties-History-Imperial/dp/0674072537) Zheng Ho treasure fleets were the victims of the conservative Confucianist winning a related debate. So total was their victory, Chinese scholars only begun to know about Treasure fleets from European records in late 19th century. The debates on whether to open or close coastal ports, continued into the 17th century.  The debates boiled down loss of revenue from economic activity vs dangers of foreign influence and bureaucratic control.

Outside Korea, Vietnam, Japan and the Mongols, the rest of the world have saw China primarily as a commercial entity, to the dismay of the educated Chinese and the Chinese government.  China is not known for its soft power.   The Korean and Japanese adopted Chinese forms of government in the Tang Dynasty, which isn't surprising given their isolation and China's relative size  The Vietnamese  sinofied after 1000 year occupation.

Moreover, China wants to people to think of her as glorious bearer of 5000 year old civilization, but as long as China uses economic pressure against other countries how can anyone think of China in anything but commercial terms.

# CHANGING EQUILIBRIUM VS CONTRACTS

[In Imperial China and the PRC view relationships between countries should reflect the current power distribution, and not bound by treaties or a false sense of equality.](https://www.amazon.com/Tang-China-Multi-Polar-Asia-Diplomacy/dp/0824872843)  Its often incorrect interpreted that a hierarchical world of China was during the early Ming Dynasty when China was a hegemon as a model. The writer David Kang says this is stable world, one that was hierarchical but equal, as opposed to Westphalia model that was equal, but wasn't. He gives an example of China that when China was strong  in East Asia, there was peace. When she was weak there was war, as other countries like Japan tried to challenge China.

Historically,  China has declared formal equality and inequality with non-Confucian states.  In our discussions, the most relevant period would be Song relations with the Liao and Jin Dynasties, respectively ruled by nomadic Khitan and Jurchen. With the Liao, China Signed the Chanyuan Treaty of 1005, whereby the Song Dynasty formally recognized the Liao Dynasty as an equal and there was two Sons of Heaven, even though the Song had to pay tribute to the Liao.   The Liao wanted a Heqin, but the Song refused, and they opted for fictitious kinship relationship and

>recognized one another’s status as equal actors in the international arena. Song emperor Zhenzong (968–1023) became the “elder brother” of the Liao emperor Shengzong (971–1031) as Zhenzong was three years his senior. Seniority, not status, determined how each emperor was addressed. Song emperor Renzong (1010–1063) was at first the“nephew” of Liao emperor Shengzong, but after the latter’s death he became the “elder brother’ of the next Liao emperor, Xingzong (1016–1055) **Explaining the Tribute System: Power, Confucianism, and War in Medieval East Asia Yuan-kang Wang.**

Behind this formal equal relationship, there was a lot of scheming and resentment in private, particularly on the Song side

>These changes, however, did not imply a fundamental shift in the Chinese view of the nomads. Official Chinese records not intended to be read by foreigners continued to use disparaging language to describe the nomads. Song imperial edicts continued to use terms such as “barbarians” and “caitiffs” to describe the Khitans.

When the Jin Dynasty defeated the Liao Dynasty, and pushed the Song into South China, the relationship changed. The Jin being the strongest state in East Asia, tried to conquer the Southern Song, but couldn't and a peace treaty was signed in 1137 with the Southern Song being a vassal of the Jin and paying tribute. During this time, both sides harbored offensive intentions.  in 1161 the Jin launched a failed offensive, and was stopped by the Yangtze which formed a defensive barrier, and the Song Navy.  As a result a new agreement was signed, the relationship was upgraded from vassal to uncle-nephew, and tribute was reduced.

One sees this behavior with China in the South China Seas, entrance to the WTO and its dealing with Hong Kong.  The agreement between the Philippines on pulling out of Scarborough Shoal was ignored by China.  The promise demilitarization of the SCS was also not honored.  The quest of course is to establish a new equilibrium in the SCS.  The same logic applies to its position in Hong Kong with regard to the political status. Hongkongers have what Chinese people called a merchant's mentality, this is particularly true of Southern Chinese in port cities, they expect an agreement to be honored. For the PR government, the equilibrium has changed, the relationship and agreement needs to recalibrated.

# CONCLUSION

I did this post to provide people with a basic understanding of concepts and themes that come up with China's worldview and interaction with the outside world .. Often people don't ask very simple questions like ""What is the Strategic Map?"" like the Ming scholars did in 15th century with actual maps.

Lastly, what a lot of people try to do when talking about the system in which China operate under is try to push it as alternative to the Westphalian model.. I am not interested, nor do I think, China strategic behavior would have been any different if faced with the same circumstances. I am more interested in how China is still using some tools from that Imperial toolkit.",weilim,geopolitics,39,10,1567031615,/r/geopolitics/comments/cws0r3/how_residues_of_chinese_imperial_worldview_still/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/cws0r3/how_residues_of_chinese_imperial_worldview_still/,post_hanoi,china,2025-12-12 17:19:33,"How Residues of Chinese Imperial Worldview Still Impact Modern China Strategic Toolkit In the previous post titled [Jaw-Jaw: China’s Great Power Disease (Edward Luttwak)](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/csc138/jawjaw_chinas_great_power_disease_edward_luttwak/) I  went through Edward Luttwak's his book, which in the post dealt mainly with who Luttwak's perceived was the  Chinese world view and cognitive biases impact their perception of the strategic reality.   The problem with Luttwak while he has a decent understanding of basic principles behind China's Imperial worldview, but not sufficient enough to explain different approaches throughout China's history, even during the same dynasty.  Secondly, he  doesn't realize the Chinese, including ethnic Han and conquest dynasties (Yuan and Qing)  used non-Chinese concepts when dealing with non-Han subjects and nations if they felt it was advantageous,

In this post, I will first examine some of the basic principles behind China's worldview in the Imperial past,This section will cover concepts such as Tianxia-Guojia, Concept of Hua-Yi,, Mandate of Heaven.   Lastly, I will examine five areas of statecraft - observing an opponent, alliances, building ""walls"",  use of commercial tools and treaties within the context of the first section.

**H. CONCLUSION**

Post 1949 leaders, like their Imperial counterparts, used a varied toolkit to guide and justify their actions. Chinese leaders take  concepts and themes from Imperial China, experience of the Soviet Union, Imperial Japan and the West.  Different leaders use different time periods and interpretations of history to frame an issue.

Secondly, Imperial Chinese rulers were pragmatist, and placed realpolitik above Confucianism. They had no problem dealing with non-Confucian polity like the steppe nomads as equals even on paper when ti was necessary, [Notions of Confucian benevolence given a dominate role on foreign policy would have amused Imperial Chinese rulers.](https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article/8/2/197/353237)

>Emperor Xuan of the Han dynasty (Xuandi, 73–49 BC). Scolding his son (the future emperor Yuan) for suggesting he employ more Confucian officials in key positions, Emperor Xuan poignantly pointed out that the Han regime had always used a combination of *ba* (霸) and *wang* (王) (i.e., coercion and humaneness) in statecraft.

To the dismay of Confucian scholars like Zhu Xi (1130-1200) the great synthesizer and founder of Song neo-Confucianism, for example, lamented that the Confucian Sage Way had not ruled the world for a single day since the classical age of Confucius and Mencius.

Lastly, I find this relevant for today, because the ""war"" with the US is economic and psychological-political, and most of China's tools during Imperial times were economic and political., not military and technological. When her main rivals the Steppe nomads gained the upper hand it was because political and economic factors..

# A. TIANXIA, HUA-YI DISTINCTION AND MANDATE OF HEAVEN

**A1. TIANXIA (**[天下](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%A4%A9%E4%B8%8B)) **AND GUOJIA (國家)**

Tianxia means all under heaven **(** [天下](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%A4%A9%E4%B8%8B) ) and is used to describe entire geographic world or the metaphysical world were human inhabit.  Its a universal concept.

[Guojia (國家) means state, country or better description would be homeland](http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/blogs/languagesofsecurity/2011/05/27/chinese-nation/). 國 means states or country with borders. The box represents the borders.  家 means home or family.  In the PRC does not regard itself official as a nation state, but a multinational state consisting or 56 officially recognized ethnic groups.

[Here is a description on the relationship between Tianxia and Guojia](https://u.osu.edu/mclc/2018/10/18/xu-jilin-the-new-tianxia/)

>The American sinologist Joseph Levenson (1920-1969) argued that in China’s early history, “the notion of the ‘state’ referred to a structure of power, while the notion of *tianxia* pointed to a structure of values.”\[3\]  As a value system, *tianxia* was a set of civilizational principles with a corresponding institutional system. The Ming dynasty scholar Gu Yanwu 顾炎武 (1613-1682) distinguished between “the loss of the state and the loss of *tianxia*.” Here, the state was merely the political order of the dynasty, while *tianxia* was a civilizational order with universal application. It referred not only to a particular dynasty or state, but above all to eternal, absolute, and universal values. The state could be destroyed, but *tianxia* could not. Otherwise humanity would devour itself, disappearing into a Hobbesian jungle.... This is because China’s civilizational tradition was not nationalistic, but rather grounded in *tianxia*, whose values were universal and humanistic rather than particular.

For most of Chinese history Tianxia was a principle, and Chinese rulers were more concerned with affairs of state (國家).  The exercise of Tianxia depended on circumstance.  During the Early Ming, Zheng He's voyages could be seen as China exercising and promoting Tianxia. However, after the Tumu Crisis of 1449, when the Ming Emperor  [Yingzong ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yingzong_of_Ming) was captured by the Mongols, Ming assumed a largely defensive policy and aimed at protecting the state. [One could see it in the Early Ming](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/35355/1/Christopher%20Eirkson%20-%20ETD.pdf) (1389)

>The earliest map we have from the Ming era, the fifteen-foot wide silk scroll Da Ming Hunyi Tu (大明混一圖, the Amalgamated Map of the Great Ming), originated in the late fourteenth century. It is strikingly different from its Song predecessors, and more closely resembles the Yuan grid map in its extent and format.258 It depicts not only what has traditionally been called “Inner China,” but the entirety of Eurasia, as well as Japan and some Southeast Asian islands, in a distorted yet recognizable form. Of the features depicted on the map, two are particularly relevant for our discussion. First, the map places greater territorial emphasis on regions once governed by the Mongols; and second, it depicts no walls or fortifications in northern China  (p118)

[By the mid-Ming (1500 AD), the map was more confined](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/35355/1/Christopher%20Eirkson%20-%20ETD.pdf)

>The Guang Yu Tu 广與图, like the Amalgamated Map, was based on Zhu Siben’s nonextant Yuditu, suggesting that it was primarily concerned with depicting the regions inside China, but the stark difference between how each represents frontier regions suggests a dramatically different way of thinking about the Eurasian world at large and the Ming empire’s place within it. The Guang Yu Tu also omits many place names for frontier regions in favour of more labels within China, despite the fact that the Amalgamated Map indicates Ming court elites had access to geographical information about Eurasia.274 The separation between the Ming empire and the steppe and the willingness to omit foreign place names, according to Luo Hongxian’s representation, was one willed by Heaven and reinforced by man.

In post 1949 China, under Mao Zedong China was concerned with bringing about Communism, which could be see as a modern version Tianxia. In contrast, Deng and other post-Mao leaders were more concerned with the Chinese state.  However, that is starting to change with Xi Jinping concept of Com[munity of Common Destiny](https://thediplomat.com/2017/10/the-community-of-common-destiny-in-xi-jinpings-new-era/).

**NOTE:** My opinion is  the Tang Dynasty was the last dynasty truly embodying Tianxia. It cosmopolitan and universal. [The borders of its frontier territories were fluid with mobile defensives, with the Tang willing to surrender territory it could hold. By the Song Dynasty, borders became more fixed and rigid. ](https://www.amazon.com/Tang-China-Multi-Polar-Asia-Diplomacy/dp/0824872843)

**A2. HUA-YI DISTINCTION**

China's dealings with the outside world can be linked to Hua-yI distinction . With Hua being Chinese, Yi being barbarians. / outsider  In Northern China context, it meant Hua meant sedentary, while Yi meant nomadic  A Yi could become Hua by adopting Hua customs and culture, and the Hua can become Yi. In the  In most cases and time periods, tha Hua are considered superior to the Yi. However, at some time period and among some writers, the two groups are different, but equal.

The general belief in China the process of cultural transmission was one way from Chinese to barbarian, and if there was any contributions they didn't have to do with things that required ""intellect"" like war, food or clothing.  This belief has existed until the Europeans undermined it in the 19th century.  According to new historiography the distinction wasn't so clear. The [founder of the Tang Dynasty, Li Yang during he struggles against the Sui Dynasty, became a vassal of the Turks, and even took a Turkic title, to win over their military support.](https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article/8/2/197/353237) The first emperor of the Ming, Hongwu was influenced by the Mongols, because Mongol rule was the only type of rule he had lived under.  Even though he declared he would purge China of Mongol influences and restore the Song, he kept the Mongol postal system and used Mongol maps, adopted more autocratic Mongol governing principles **(Timothy Brooks, Troubled Empire** **p85-100**)

In terms of people, the interaction occurred both ways, even though the transition from Hua to Yi has negative connoations and less well known. In deep Southern provinces like Guangdong and Guangxi, you have people who are consider themselves Han Chinese, but when DNA test were done, they had very little Han Chinese genetic markers. Meaning assimilation was both cultural and genetic. However, throughout Chinese history you had Han Chinese who became nomads. During Liao Dynasty (916-1125)  under the nomadic Khitans, which ruled parts of Northern China, many Han Chinese living in those areas had become ""Khitanized"".  [They adopted Khitan burial rites](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.691.2626&rep=rep1&type=pdf).   The divisions only become more racialized under the Mongol Yuan, when Hua meant Han Chinese, and the term Han Chinese was officially used.

The Hua-Yi concept is important, because its the key principle between as to what extent China's policy toward foreigners is inclusive and exclusive. Secondly, it frames the debate of Chinese nationality based on blood or culture, which influences the debate on Hong Kong, Taiwan, how China deals with minorities and overseas Chinese.

China foreign policy can be divided into exclusivist or inclusivist as [Arthur Waldron](https://www.history.upenn.edu/people/faculty/arthur-waldron) argued in his assessment of Ming-Mongol relations of the [15-16th century](https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article/8/2/197/353237).

>Waldron reveals a Ming foreign policy approach under a condition of extreme conflict between the Chinese and the Mongols, one that he variously characterizes as culturalist, moralistic, exclusive, xenophobic, and inflexible. This is contrasted with an opposing approach described as cosmopolitan, inclusive, rational, pragmatic, and flexible

The debate here is whether or not Confucianism is 1) As Waldron argues is exclusive from the beginning, and its only because of pragmatic approach by the rulers that is inclusive 2) Is it inclusive. but only became exclusive as a result of negative experience dealing with foreigners like the [An Lushan Rebellion](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-an-lushan-rebellion-195114) (755-763), the Mongol Invasion (1205-1279) and Century of Humiliation 3) [Was inclusive until the rise of neo-Confucianism during the Song Dynasty](https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article/8/2/197/353237).  At the moment in China you are dealing with exclusive foreign policy with some inclusive elements.

Chinese identity is based on both blood and culture, and this is what distinguishes China from East Asian neighbor Japan and Korea, which are based largely on blood. Many Chinese don't know how different they are to their East Asian neighbors. [For example,in China  ethnic Koreans are given Chinese citizenship on birth; whereas, few ethnic Han Chinese have South Korean citizenship despite having lived their for 3-4 generations.](http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/152641.html) The South  Koreans make it very difficult for them to do so.

[As the Australian writer and diplomat said, the Japanese are tribal, while the Chinese, like Westerners, are dogmatic](http://gregoryclark.net/lifestory/page21/page21.html).  This culturalist definition of identity, that by the late 19th century, when Confucianism had become intertwined with Chinese elite identity made it reform difficult. Because Western idea undermine the Confucian hierarchy of ideas that they based their legitimacy on.  In contrast, the Japanese with their tribal identity, the transition was much easier.

Because Chinese nationalism is largely cultural, propaganda and ""indoctrination"" is used to shape the identity. This isn't unique to China, a more extreme example is Malay cultural identity in Malaysia, That is why Chinese Communist  propaganda and trying to shape's someone mind was more important in China than in the Soviet Union. Its why you see the Chinese attempt to ""sinocize"" Uighur society, which is something the Soviet weren't too concerned with.

**A3. MANDATE OF HEAVEN**

The mandate of heaven is most a key source of the instability of Imperial China. This concept carries over into modern China, by adding to the culture of paranoia.

>The [**Mandate of Heaven**](https://www.ancient.eu/Mandate_of_Heaven/) (*Tianming*), also known as Heaven’s Mandate, was the divine source of authority and the right to rule of [**China**](https://www.ancient.eu/china/)’s early kings and emperors. The ancient god or divine force known as Heaven or Sky had selected this particular individual to rule on its behalf on earth. An important element of the mandate was that although the ruler had been given great power he also had a moral obligation to use it for the good of his people, if he did not then his state would suffer terrible disasters and he would lose the right to govern.   

The Mandate of Heaven was a key source of instability in Imperial China, because it removes ""formal"" barriers to seizing power. Any man (or even women) can become Emperor, which increases the number of usurpers markedly.  In feudal Europe, one had to establish a hereditary claim to the throne. [This was made worse after the fall of the Tang, when aristocratic families that dominated political life in China from Han Dynasty had been killed or suffered reduced circumstances during the transition from Tang to Song.](https://orias.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/2010-tackett-summary.pdf) It was one reason why the Song built up the Confucian bureaucracy.  During the Song, Song rulers were deeply paranoid about loyalty of the Song military, and this hampered military effectiveness against the barbarian kingdoms (Liao and Jin).  Interestingly the last ethnic Han dynasty, the Ming, was founded by a commoner.

When the Japanese adopted the [Taiho Code in 703](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Taiho-code) from the Tang Dynasty, two key elements they left out.  The first was in official position in Japan were determined also class, not merit alone.  Secondly, the Japanese rejected the Mandate of Heaven, believing it derived from Imperial descent, not righteousness as a ruler.

Lastly, the Mandate of Heaven combined with universality of Tianxia and the notion of Hua can become Yi, means even non-Han Chinese can claim the Mandate of Heaven, as shown by Kublai Khan (Yuan) and Nurachi (Qing).  When the Mongols tried to invade Japan (1274-1281), the response of the Japanese nobility was to ban together to resist the foreign invader, because they had inter connected family and kin ties to each other. In contrast, a Chinese general of the Song who risen from the ranks most likely had much fewer familial ties connecting him with the ""establishment"".  During the Mongol invasion of the Song many Song general and troops defected to the Mongols, while in  Japan it was unheard of.

# B. BARBARIAN HANDLING AND ENCOUNTERS WITH DONALD J TRUMP

How China conducts interference operations is to focus on individuals. As this article points out [""playing the man"" operations](https://warontherocks.com/2018/01/contrasting-chinas-russias-influence-operations/)

>The Chinese, however, seem to focus on individuals rather than effects, on shaping the personal context rather than operational tricks. It is person-to-person relationships that carry the weight of Chinese information operations. Many of China’s first-generation diplomats and negotiators — including Zhou Enlai, Wu Xiuquan, Li Kenong, Xiong Xianghui, Liao Chengzhi, and many others — worked for some time as intelligence officers. For example, Li Kenong was Beijing’s chief negotiator at the Panmunjom talks with the United Nations during the Korean War and a vice foreign minister. His party career, however, began in intelligence where he was one of the “[Three Heroes of the Dragon’s Lair](https://jamestown.org/program/shriver-case-highlights-traditional-chinese-espionage/)” and rose [to become a deputy director of the party’s intelligence service](http://www.qntsw.com/lishi/20161225/6388.html).

One possible explanation for this individual focused operations, which also extends to how it deals with leaders of respective countries, is China's tributary relations which couched in personal terms between sovereign and sovereign, but more importantly her long involvement with the Steppe nomads.  For much of the last 1000 years, the biggest threat to China was a charismatic leader uniting and organizing the steppe nomads into invading China. This happened twice, with Genghis Khan and Nurhaci, the founder and ruler of the Manchus.  However,  there were numerous and less successful leaders the Chinese manage to defeat, eliminate or frustrate.

You see this replicated in modern times with China dealing with Rizak Najib in Malaysia, Rodrigo Duterte in Philippines. With Donald Trump, some writers have commented that Chinese tried to use the same tactics on Trump like approving his trademarks in China, trying to reach out personally to him etc. However,  I think the Chinese did this to establish a good working relationship with Trump, and were open minded about Trump in the beginning.  The problem in Chinese leaders get most of the advice of the US through Wall Street elites and the establishment. If the Western media is producing articles like  [Donald Trump, Barbarian Emperor](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/04/donald-trump-barbarian-emperor-japan-china-defense/).  [Opinion | Donald Trump, Barbarian at the Debate](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/opinion/donald-trump-barbarian-at-the-debate.html). [Trump the Barbarian](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-the-barbarian_b_8149866),  [How Republican mandarins will try to civilize Trump the barbarian](https://theweek.com/articles/622572/how-republican-mandarins-try-civilize-trump-barbarian),  [Don't expect America's media to stop barbarian Donald Trump.](https://www.smh.com.au/world/dont-expect-americas-media-to-stop-barbarian-donald-trump-heres-why-20160729-gqgo8w.html), [Trump the Barbarian - Baltimore Sun](https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/op-ed/bs-ed-trump-coulter-20150901-story.html) and  [Editorial: Vote for Clinton and against the barbarian at the gate](https://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/editorial-vote-clinton-against-barbarian-at-gate/) how do you expect the Chinese leadership to think.

# C. RISE OF CONFUCIANIST, HEQIN MARRIAGE AND ALLIANCES

One of the most significant factors in the China'a foreign relations was the rise of Confucianist through the Imperial Examination System.  The imperial examination system we normally associate with Imperial China, came  during the Sui Dynasty from 581-618 AD, and was  expanded during the Tang Dynasty particularly under Empress Wu Zerian. Besides providing capable administrators, the reasons were also political 1) To create a group of elites loyal to the Emperor without a local base of support like the hereditary nobles. 2) To bind various parts of the Empire together under one ideological umbrella. By the Northern Song Dynasty almost all higher ranking officials got their positions through the examination system.   There were differing opinions about foreign policy, with some officials arguing for a more open policy, you hear fewer such voices as you progress in to Ming and later on the Qing. The dangers of such a system compared to hereditary oligarchy like Japan during the Meiji restoration is you are more likely to develop group think.  The education background of the Japanese nobility who made up vanguard of the Meiji restoration was more eclectic  than the Qing officials during the same period. Ib Qing China, openness and reform was seen as iconclaust, whereas in Japan it was a faction

&#x200B;

**C1. HEQIN MARRIAGES**

[The increasing dominance of Confucianism from the Song onward more serious impact was the abandonment of the policy of Heqin (marriage alliance with barbarian kingdoms) by the Song.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heqin#Sui_Dynasty) Neither the Song or Ming Dynasty (the last ethnic Han dynasty) that followed engaged in marriages alliances with steppe nomads.  Prior to the Song, dynasties made extensive use of the Heqin.  Under the Tang Dynasty there were 21 marriage alliances with bordering states (Tuyuhun, the [Tibetan Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Empire), the [Khitans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khitan_people) and the allied [Kumo Xi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumo_Xi), the [Uyghur Khaganate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_Khaganate), and [Nanzhao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanzhao)).

Confucian scholars were opposed to the heqin dating as far back to the Han Dynasty, because it was humiliating and violated the Confucian principle of hierarchy **(Harmony and War: Confucian Culture and Chinese Power Politics Yuan-kang Wang)**.  During the relations with the Song, the Liao (Khitan) requested a Heqin, but the Song refused, referring to keep nominal kinship and increase the tribute. Confucian advisors said it would be too humiliating.  This question popped up again when the Mongols during  [Tumu Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumu_Crisis)  on 1449  suggested the captured Ming Emperor, Yingzong, marry a Mongol princess. The Ming refused.

While eliminating its use wasn't fatal, it removed a key tool in steppe politics for the Chinese. The tributes and treaties wasn't enough to endear trust.   It was the beginning of solidifying divisions between Hua (Han Chinese)  and Yi (Barbarians).  This would become important during the decades leading to the Manchu conquest of China. From the early 1600s, the Ming used bribes to pit Mongols clans against the Manchus,  [Nurhaci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurhaci) and his son, Hong Taiji, made extensive marriages alliances with Mongols clans which helped mitigate against this.  [Even when a Mongol tribe went against the Manchus, pre-existing marriage alliance would serve as a way bring the sides together once a conflict had died down.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl1-vop7ipY&t=32m24s)

**NOTE:** The retreat from Steppe affairs was gradual and it begun in the Tang Dynasty after An Lushan rebellion which resulted in the loss of Xinjiang. With the loss of Xinjiang, China lost a source of  horses and mounter archers. Secondly, she also lost a key platform in steppe politics.

**C2. ALLIANCES**

As described in the paper[Xi’s Vision for Transforming Global Governance: A Strategic Challenge for Washington and Its Allies](https://tnsr.org/2018/11/xis-vision-for-transforming-global-governance-a-strategic-challenge-for-washington-and-its-allies/)

>President Jiang Zemin’s “new security concept” in the late 1990s echoed the Five Principles and rejected the “old security concept based on military alliances and build-up of armaments.”[**7**](https://tnsr.org/2018/11/xis-vision-for-transforming-global-governance-a-strategic-challenge-for-washington-and-its-allies/#_ftn7) In a similar vein, President Hu proposed building a “harmonious world” in a 2005 speech to the United Nations. Hu affirmed his predecessors’ concepts and called for reforms to give developing countries a greater voice in global governance.[**8**](https://tnsr.org/2018/11/xis-vision-for-transforming-global-governance-a-strategic-challenge-for-washington-and-its-allies/#_ftn8) Each of these proposals reflects long-standing Chinese objections to features of the current international order, including U.S.-led security alliances, military superpower, and democratic norms.

However, Modern China's reluctance is as much historical and cultural, as well as geopolitical.    Although its getting better, since the founding of the PRC, maintaining and keeping alliances have been a struggle. Within 17 years of the founding of the People's Republic, China was isolated from both the Western and Eastern Bloc. This earlier ineptitude was exacerbated  by the inexperience and ideologicalization of the PRC diplomatic corp in the 1950-60s.  [China was very lucky Nixon was motivated by tactical considerations](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/445507-henry-kissinger-is-still-brilliant-and-still-wrong-about-china) when he met Mao.

Firstly, when it comes to bilateral alliances or partnership, China's role has often be  passive and defensive, while the other partner would do most of the heavy lifting with China playing support.  In modern times you see this with China - Pakistan vs India, China-Cambodia vs Vietnam (USSR - Vietnam vs China), China - US vs USSR (In the 1970-80s), China - Russia vs US. In the Imperial era you clearly see this China- Korea vs Japan (Tang and Ming Dynasty). Sometimes, China gets dragged into conflicts by this more active partner like with the China-Cambodia vs Vietnam between 1975-79.  (Brantley Womack, Asymmetry and Systemic Misconception: China, Vietnam and Cambodia during the 1970s)

This inexperience with alliances also extend to when it comes to undermining alliances.  Often its better to keep a weak opposing alliance, than break it altogether. For example, the weakness as ASEAN as alliance is as Lee Kuan Yew said is its combination of two strategically incompatible regions, Mainland SEA and Maritime SEA. Mainland SEA will naturally gravitate toward China, while Maritime SEA is more independent. [When China sent three naval incursions into Indonesia's Natuna EEZ in 2016](https://thediplomat.com/2016/06/a-third-2016-natuna-stand-off-highlights-growing-indonesia-china-tensions/), the Indonesians decided it would be necessary to find stronger partners.  [Before Indonesia wasted a lot of diplomatic energy trying to hold ASEAN together](http://www.ciis.org.cn/english/2012-12/31/content_5638110.htm).  From 2016 onward, the Indonesians sought to strength both economic and military ties with both [Australia](https://dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/not-yet-in-force/iacepa/pages/indonesia-australia-comprehensive-economic-partnership-agreement.aspx) and [India](https://www.eurasiareview.com/24062018-india-indonesia-and-sabang-port-a-game-changer-analysis/).

# D. THE GREAT WALL AND THE ART OF BUILDING WALLS

The Great Wall we know today, or Ming Great Wall, was built / reinforced as a result of the of Tumu Crisis of 1449. Prior to this, dynasties built fortifications in sections of the Northern Steppe to defend against northern tribes These walls also served as offensive platform. Wall construction ebbed and flowed depending on the Dynasty. Both the Tang and Song didn't build any notable additions to these walls.  Even during the early Ming, Emperor Yong le had ordered the outer garrisons that served as a the first line of defense against nomadic attacks dismantled.

[Tumu Crisis](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/35355/1/Christopher%20Eirkson%20-%20ETD.pdf) came about when the Ming Emperor  [Yingzong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yingzong_of_Ming) was captured by a Mongol force during an expedition beyond the Wall.  This event symbolized the military weakness of Yuan.  Prior to this the Ming still had pretense of emulating the Yuan, even Zheng Ho treasure fleets could be seen in this light.  Here is an interesting observation of maps

>[The Da Ming Hunyi Tu’s lack of a clear divide, either man-made or natural, between China and the steppe indicates that early Ming rulers maintained an open vision of empire and intended to reconstitute the old Yuan polity. Song maps, and later Ming maps, consistently separate China and the steppe with walls or geographic features like deserts.](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/35355/1/Christopher%20Eirkson%20-%20ETD.pdf)

After the Tumu affair, one sees a increased wall building, and the Great Wall, becomes the Ming centerpiece for barbarian handling on the steppes.

The obsession with building walls, has carried over into modern China. The the Great Firewall, Wall of Capital Controls and militarization of the Spratly, should be seen as walls to protect China. The biggest difference was Ming rulers knew once they committed to building a ""wall"" it would meaning given up their engagement on expansion into the Steppe.

How can China take a more prominent role in the world, when its internet is walled off from the rest of the world? The Chinese government spends money to buy anti-protestors ads on Facebook and Twitter, yet bans them from operating in China. It wants the Yuan to be equal footing with the Dollar and Euro, all the while maintaining capital controls.

# E. COMMERCIAL VS POLITICAL

The one aspect the Chinese Communist Party shares with the Confucius, is the commercial interest are subordinate to the political. The PRC uses economic clout to gain strategic advantage.

The reason why Henry Kissinger got on well with the Chinese officialdom was they both believed commercial interest should be subordinate to the geopolitical / strategic. From 1949-2016, the West took this approach, because for majority of the time China's economy was small. However, anyone who believes that geopolitical  concerns can outweigh the commercial  is going against 500 years of Chinese relations with the outside world, where economics dominates the political. This is particularly true of the US.  China should count itself very lucky this state of affairs lasted this long.

**E1. CHINESE THE MATERIALIST**

From the Song Dynasty onward until 1911, Chinese statecraft increasingly resorted to monetary methods When foreign countries paid tribute to China, it was actually an excuse to conduct trade. Under the Song, the Chinese paid both the Liao and the Jin tributes. During the Ming they would pay one Mongol tribe to side with them in a fight against other tribes

There is this belief with regards to China relations with South Korea and Japan, or between China and Taiwan, that money can buy acceptance and can eventually mellow long standing grievances. It can't, unless those issues are addressed directly. [China, South Korea and Japan don't have an FTA, despite the FTA first being proposed in 2001](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2165260/china-japan-and-south-korea-aim-speed-talks-free-trade).  While Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia do. The historical tensions between these three countries is just as bad as in Northeast Asia.  In the last 15 years, Cambodia and Thailand have border skirmishes, ethnic Vietnamese have been attacked in Cambodia and there have been anti-Thai riots in Cambodia. However. relations quickly return to normal. Where as in Northeast Asia, a small incident can derail relations for 5-6 years.  The reason for this is the underlying historical issues in Northeast Asia haven't been resolved.

The same applies for China and Taiwan. [The incident that gave birth to many young Hong Kong activist like Joshua Wong was attempts by the Hong Kong government to introduced patriotic education in 2011, when Wong was only 14.](https://www.cnn.com/2012/07/30/world/asia/hong-kong-national-education-controversy/index.html) China couldn't get Hong Kongers to accept ""patriotic education"", who prior to the last 8 years were very apolitical.  What do you expect would happen in Taiwan, where people are actually taught an opposing narrative to what the CPC teach, How can you expect to get descendants of people who fought under the KMT to accept the CPC version of Second Sino Japanese War? Basically it will be the equivalent of serving a turd at the family alter.  [Ma Yingjeou made a speech urging China to accept historical reality.](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taiwans-president-ma-ying-jeou-remembers-nationalist-victory-in-sino-japan-war)

**E2. DOMINANCE OF COMMERCE**

Historically both India and China's role in producing goods utilizing its specialization of labor resulting from their vast populations. Both India and China were much more populous than the rest of the world, particularly their neighbors in Southeast Asia.  Prior to the Song Dynasty trade with China, usually meant foreign traders going to China to trade.  Starting from the Song Dynasty onward, Chinese traders increasingly started to venture outward bringing Chinese goods to foreign markets, and foreign goods back to China.

[During the Ming and Qing Dynasty there was the constant debate as to how open China should be to foreign trade.](https://www.amazon.com/Troubled-Empire-Dynasties-History-Imperial/dp/0674072537) Zheng Ho treasure fleets were the victims of the conservative Confucianist winning a related debate. So total was their victory, Chinese scholars only begun to know about Treasure fleets from European records in late 19th century. The debates on whether to open or close coastal ports, continued into the 17th century.  The debates boiled down loss of revenue from economic activity vs dangers of foreign influence and bureaucratic control.

Outside Korea, Vietnam, Japan and the Mongols, the rest of the world have saw China primarily as a commercial entity, to the dismay of the educated Chinese and the Chinese government.  China is not known for its soft power.   The Korean and Japanese adopted Chinese forms of government in the Tang Dynasty, which isn't surprising given their isolation and China's relative size  The Vietnamese  sinofied after 1000 year occupation.

Moreover, China wants to people to think of her as glorious bearer of 5000 year old civilization, but as long as China uses economic pressure against other countries how can anyone think of China in anything but commercial terms.

# CHANGING EQUILIBRIUM VS CONTRACTS

[In Imperial China and the PRC view relationships between countries should reflect the current power distribution, and not bound by treaties or a false sense of equality.](https://www.amazon.com/Tang-China-Multi-Polar-Asia-Diplomacy/dp/0824872843)  Its often incorrect interpreted that a hierarchical world of China was during the early Ming Dynasty when China was a hegemon as a model. The writer David Kang says this is stable world, one that was hierarchical but equal, as opposed to Westphalia model that was equal, but wasn't. He gives an example of China that when China was strong  in East Asia, there was peace. When she was weak there was war, as other countries like Japan tried to challenge China.

Historically,  China has declared formal equality and inequality with non-Confucian states.  In our discussions, the most relevant period would be Song relations with the Liao and Jin Dynasties, respectively ruled by nomadic Khitan and Jurchen. With the Liao, China Signed the Chanyuan Treaty of 1005, whereby the Song Dynasty formally recognized the Liao Dynasty as an equal and there was two Sons of Heaven, even though the Song had to pay tribute to the Liao.   The Liao wanted a Heqin, but the Song refused, and they opted for fictitious kinship relationship and

>recognized one another’s status as equal actors in the international arena. Song emperor Zhenzong (968–1023) became the “elder brother” of the Liao emperor Shengzong (971–1031) as Zhenzong was three years his senior. Seniority, not status, determined how each emperor was addressed. Song emperor Renzong (1010–1063) was at first the“nephew” of Liao emperor Shengzong, but after the latter’s death he became the “elder brother’ of the next Liao emperor, Xingzong (1016–1055) **Explaining the Tribute System: Power, Confucianism, and War in Medieval East Asia Yuan-kang Wang.**

Behind this formal equal relationship, there was a lot of scheming and resentment in private, particularly on the Song side

>These changes, however, did not imply a fundamental shift in the Chinese view of the nomads. Official Chinese records not intended to be read by foreigners continued to use disparaging language to describe the nomads. Song imperial edicts continued to use terms such as “barbarians” and “caitiffs” to describe the Khitans.

When the Jin Dynasty defeated the Liao Dynasty, and pushed the Song into South China, the relationship changed. The Jin being the strongest state in East Asia, tried to conquer the Southern Song, but couldn't and a peace treaty was signed in 1137 with the Southern Song being a vassal of the Jin and paying tribute. During this time, both sides harbored offensive intentions.  in 1161 the Jin launched a failed offensive, and was stopped by the Yangtze which formed a defensive barrier, and the Song Navy.  As a result a new agreement was signed, the relationship was upgraded from vassal to uncle-nephew, and tribute was reduced.

One sees this behavior with China in the South China Seas, entrance to the WTO and its dealing with Hong Kong.  The agreement between the Philippines on pulling out of Scarborough Shoal was ignored by China.  The promise demilitarization of the SCS was also not honored.  The quest of course is to establish a new equilibrium in the SCS.  The same logic applies to its position in Hong Kong with regard to the political status. Hongkongers have what Chinese people called a merchant's mentality, this is particularly true of Southern Chinese in port cities, they expect an agreement to be honored. For the PR government, the equilibrium has changed, the relationship and agreement needs to recalibrated.

# CONCLUSION

I did this post to provide people with a basic understanding of concepts and themes that come up with China's worldview and interaction with the outside world .. Often people don't ask very simple questions like ""What is the Strategic Map?"" like the Ming scholars did in 15th century with actual maps.

Lastly, what a lot of people try to do when talking about the system in which China operate under is try to push it as alternative to the Westphalian model.. I am not interested, nor do I think, China strategic behavior would have been any different if faced with the same circumstances. I am more interested in how China is still using some tools from that Imperial toolkit.",neutral,0.0700204074382782,0.8846607208251953,0.04531875625252724,-0.02470165118575096,-0.02470165118575096

The US has put sanctions on Iran. At this point, Iran is practically begging for sanction relief. The common consensus is that the US is putting sanctions on Iran in order to create dissatisfaction with the current regime among the Iranian people, possibly leading to a revolution that will install a more democratic and pro-US government. This would lead to Iran being less inclined to work with China. If the sanctions don't work, the US can always use its military to invade, but that would be a last resort.

If Iran is no longer willing to cooperate with China's ambitions, the only other option left for the BRI's land route would be to travel through Russia into Eastern Europe, where the US has much more influence than in Southeast Europe.

dkp527,China’s Xi Jinping has more to worry about than slowing economic growth: Crises such as Hong Kong protests and African swine fever offer sterner test of party’s grip on power,"https://www.ft.com/content/64cc35b0-f314-11e9-b018-3ef8794b17c6

Xi Jinping has plenty of problems, but ever-slower economic growth is not yet one of them.

China’s gross domestic product growth estimate for the third quarter, which came in at a slightly lower than forecast at 6 per cent, was widely and reflexively bemoaned as the lowest such figure in 30 years — as was second-quarter growth and as fourth-quarter growth will almost certainly be as well.

But China’s president and his economic advisers could not care less about such headlines. They only care that the world’s second-largest economy remains on track to meet the government’s full-year growth target of at least 6 per cent, which it is set to do, and urban job creation — Beijing aims to create 11m new jobs this year. 


Hitting the economic growth target, which in turn helps the Chinese government achieve its urban job creation aims, is easily done given Beijing’s grip on the banking system and state-owned enterprises.

If growth is trending lower than Chinese officials are comfortable with, they can tap the economic accelerator — a little more credit here, a few more project approvals there. If trending above target, and therefore threatening to undermine Beijing’s three-year campaign against excessive debt and financial risks, the leadership taps the brakes. 

“China needs slower growth” to avoid wasting money on uneconomic projects, Trey McArver at Beijing consultancy Trivium said in a research note on Friday. “Policymakers’ reluctance to stimulate the economy might disappoint investors in the short term, but it’s a huge long-term positive.”

The real risks that Mr Xi’s administration needs to worry about are “blindside” ones that catch it by surprise. And there have been plenty of these this year, ranging from the continuing protest movement in Hong Kong to a nationwide African swine fever epidemic. 

These crises have something in common. They arose in large part because the authoritarian system that Mr Xi inherited seven years ago — and has made far more rigid during his time in office — may be great at building infrastructure, repressing dissent and censoring the internet, but it is often hopeless when it comes to passing bad news up the chain. 

One senior US official, who has spent almost 30 years dealing with Chinese Communist party cadres across the country, said he was shocked during a recent visit to Beijing at how badly briefed even politburo-level officials appeared to be.

“They appeared to have been given very bad information,” the US official said. “They kept saying things that were flat-out false.” 

Even in private settings, Chinese officials cling to their official narrative that American and British “black hands” sparked the unrest in Hong Kong. It is a narrative that conveniently absolves everyone, from Beijing’s representative office in the semi-autonomous territory to Mr Xi himself, of the failure to appreciate the potentially destabilising consequences of Hong Kong’s unrepresentative political system, the chronic incompetence of its coddled civil servants-turned-politicians and its soaring economic inequality. 

Xi Jinping’s claim to Mao’s mantle carries risks
In the case of African swine fever, rural officials’ reflexive reluctance to report bad news up the chain of command to provincial governments and Beijing has been reinforced by the financial consequences of doing so.

Knowing that cash-strapped local governments were either unable or unwilling to compensate them as mandated by Beijing, affected farmers rushed to cull herds or sold infected pigs across county or provincial lines, reducing pork supplies and hastening the spread of the disease. 

As of the end of September, China’s pig herd had collapsed by 40 per cent and pork prices were up 70 per cent year on year. The central government is now trying to force state banks to step into the breach by issuing more credit to pig farmers, but they are reluctant to do so. 

As powerful as he is, even Mr Xi cannot compel local governments to give away money they do not have or force the local branches of state banks to issue loans to pig farmers that they know will not be repaid.

daxrqp,"Some thoughts on Xi Jinping as ""emperor for life"" as China turns 70","As the PRC turns 70 on October 1st this coming Tuesday, there are a handful of recurrent political questions I've seen in the subreddit over the last year that bridge the discussion between domestic Chinese politics and China related geopolitics. I think one of the most prevalent questions are the prospects of Xi Jinping as ""emperor for life"".

By now, everyone knows that China removed presidential term limits in 2018, allowing Xi to preside as president for more than two terms. Many news media, commentators and commenters have suggested this would enable Xi to be ""emperor for life"". However there are also more than a few individuals that correctly point out that the true seat of power isn't the president of China but rather in the general secretary of the CCP which does not have term limits.

That is to say, in theory, Xi could retain his seat as general secretary (as well as other positions that he holds) and give up the role of president to someone else and still retain much of his power. But doing so would obviously lead to a degree of awkwardness not only in terms of perceiving which titles have how much power, but also in terms of the internal division of power within the CCP and Chinese government.

Jiang and Hu served about 10 years each (""two presidential terms"" equivalent) as paramount leaders of China. What can be inferred from the abolishing of term limits is that Xi almost certainly will stay on as China's paramount leader for more than ""two presidential terms"" (aka 10 years). The big questions which follow, are -- *will he be ""emperor for life,"" and ""why does Xi need or want to be paramount leader for more than 10 years*? I have my own take on these two questions, which are actually dovetailed quite closely to each other.

* ***Will Xi be emperor for life?*** \-- I personally consider such a prospect to be unlikely. The CCP are many things, but they do not tend to miss the big glaring warning signs in China's own history. The time of Mao and the many Chinese emperors in respective dynasties should be more than enough proof to the CCP that allowing a leader to serve **literally until they die** is a recipe for disaster, as the leader becomes more senile, cognitively impaired and progressively less able to effectively discharge their duties. Now, one could suggest that perhaps Xi had become so powerful that he was able to corral and force the entire CCP to capitulate to allow him to become ""emperor for life"" against their will. But if that were true, then I believe we would be seeing Xi throw his individual power around in China much more than we are -- i.e.: it would be approaching Mao levels of power at his peak. IMO it is much more likely that granting Xi the consent for him to govern for more than 10 years was a collective CCP decision in some form.
* ***Why does Xi need or want to be leader for more than 10 years?*** \-- The most common answer to this question I've seen thrown around in news media and commentators is that Xi is power hungry, seeking to solidify his authoritarian position against enemies, and the general idea that he is seeking power for the sake of power. While I think such a possibility cannot be ruled out, I also think it is a bit simplistic and seems to come from individuals and groups who were critiques of Xi to begin with. I have an alternative answer to this question, which ties it in with China's place in the world and the evolving geopolitical situation which China faces. Basically, I believe that Xi (and to a degree, the CCP overall) views the early to late 2020s as a potentially ""dangerous time"" in China's future.
   * This is a period in which the Chinese GDP is projected to start to come within a stone's throw distance of the US GDP (nominal terms), as well as a period in which the political status of Taiwan might undergo upheaval depending on the political party in power in Taiwan during the period (and we all know that the political status of Taiwan is very much tied with the possibility of military conflict). Chinese military capability will also likely be further advanced and greater in magnitude by this period, with capability gaps with foreign competitors closing the gap further from today. The US is almost certainly going to further engage in great power geopolitical and geoeconomic competition on multiple fronts as well.
   * In terms of geopolitics/geoeconomics, I believe the early 2020s to late 2020s is a period where the potential for conflict and threat to China's future development and growth trajectory is greatest. Many people speak of the Thucydides trap, and while it is not a perfect term, for the purposes of discussion, I believe the early 2020s-late 2020s is when the risk of the ""trap"" is the greatest. In other words, I think the early 2020s-late 2020s will be a potentially decisive period of time where China's medium and long term future can be ""made or broken"". A few users in this sub have mentioned this as well, and a few Chinese strategic commentators in the past have alluded to this (though I cannot recall the exact links to the interviews or comments).
   * If Xi had 10 years (aka two presidential term equivalents) as paramount leader of China, it means he would be handing over power to a successor around 2022 -- i.e.: right as this ""decisive period"" begins. I believe that the CCP may have desired a more continuous sustainment of policy and a more experienced leader for this period, and recognized that having a transition of power could be dangerous to Chinese national interests and present a geopolitical risk.
   * A comparison could be made to Deng, who was in many ways paramount leader of China from 1978 to 1992 (14 years) and whose leadership conducted the massive course correction and created the foundations of China's economic growth in subsequent decades under Jiang and Hu. Xi has the equally gargantuan task of ensuring China's geopolitical stability and survival, as well as to create a foundation for China's future geopolitical growth in the future -- such a task would likely not be achievable within merely 10 years of power (not to mention, the beginning and end of a 10 year leadership era is marked by a ""lame duck""/transitory period meaning 10 years of leadership is more like \~8 years of actual active leadership).

With all the above said, I do have a few caveats:

1. I think removing presidential term limits does present a potential longer term risk down the road; i.e.: it opens the door to future leaders seeking to maintain power for the sake of power and result in an ""emperor for life"" situation when the situation did not demand it.
2. What I wrote above is very much coming from an underlying ""assumption"" that the CCP and Xi are rational actors and that Xi himself is not seeking to ""gain power for the sake of power"" alone. There are many people who believe that Xi may seek to gain power for the sake of power alone for various reasons such as seeking to ensure his own survival or simply because they perceive Xi to be of an authoritarian or power hungry nature inherently. As written above, I acknowledge this as a non-zero possibility, but I think immediately deferring to this assumption without considering alternatives is potentially dangerous or at least a bit intellectually lazy.
3. For the record, Xi most definitely has consolidated power much more than his predecessors Jiang and Hu had done. But there's been much talk that he is the most powerful leader in China ""since Mao"" which I think is a wild exaggeration considering the things Mao was able to do unilaterally during the peak of his power. I would argue that Xi is the most powerful leader since Deng -- but of course the connotations of comparing Xi with Deng and comparing Xi with Mao are rather different to your average reader.
4. Also, it goes without saying that there are definitely still some factions and individuals in the CCP who would be opposed to Xi for various reasons or another. I'm sure some of them would be happy to impede certain aspects of Xi's domestic agenda and see him taken down a few notches. But in terms of the big picture I don't see the kind of hidden institutional discontent in the CCP that has been claimed by some foreign commentators.

My projection for the most likely course of Xi's leadership -- he remains in power until \~2027. I.e.: he serves 3 ""presidential term"" equivalents. Afterwards he will step down and a transition of power will occur most likely to someone from the ""[7th generation](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/China-People-s-Congress/China-grooms-Xi-s-successor-skipping-a-generation)"" of leadership (born in the 1970s or slightly after).

However Xi will likely remain as a CCP elder with meaningful influence on the overall direction of the country and party but I expect the active leadership to be from someone from the 7th generation. (The 6th generation of leadership will probably not see a paramount leader from their cohort -- there will be no successor for 2022.)

This is my own personal projection and observation; I certainly don't claim it to be guaranteed but I think it is one of the more likely paths forward assuming that Xi's elevation of power is not merely something done to attain ""power for the sake of power"".",PLArealtalk,geopolitics,900,164,1569776090,/r/geopolitics/comments/daxrqp/some_thoughts_on_xi_jinping_as_emperor_for_life/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/daxrqp/some_thoughts_on_xi_jinping_as_emperor_for_life/,post_hanoi,china,2025-12-12 17:19:33,"Some thoughts on Xi Jinping as ""emperor for life"" as China turns 70 As the PRC turns 70 on October 1st this coming Tuesday, there are a handful of recurrent political questions I've seen in the subreddit over the last year that bridge the discussion between domestic Chinese politics and China related geopolitics.

6. The economy isn't doing that great under Xi, and unlike Deng, he's hamstrung - he fronts himself as a committed Leninist/Maoist, so he's been unable to be pragmatic about dealing with the economic slow down.

Contrary to what many people think, I consider Xi to be more like Brezhnev than Mao. China is at an inflection point - and this is a man who lacks ideas - apart from more repression. I expect the grumbling about him to mount - starting from the Central Committee and percolating downwards. I don't see him as being in a ""leader for life"" situation.

6. The economy isn't doing that great under Xi, and unlike Deng, he's hamstrung - he fronts himself as a committed Leninist/Maoist, so he's been unable to be pragmatic about dealing with the economic slow down.

Contrary to what many people think, I consider Xi to be more like Brezhnev than Mao. China is at an inflection point - and this is a man who lacks ideas - apart from more repression. I expect the grumbling about him to mount - starting from the Central Committee and percolating downwards. I don't see him as being in a ""leader for life"" situation. Far too many contradictions are building.

dvgm25,Donald Trump threatens escalation of trade war with China: US President says tariffs will be ‘raised very substantially’ if no truce is reached,"https://www.ft.com/content/ef7d04c2-0576-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd

President Donald Trump threatened a new escalation of the trade war with China, saying US tariffs on Chinese goods would be “raised very substantially” if no truce was reached with officials in Beijing. 

Mr Trump’s comments at the Economic Club of New York highlight the trouble the US administration is having in its efforts to strike an interim deal with China that would bring a halt to the commercial conflict afflicting the world’s two largest economies. 

After Mr Trump announced that a tentative agreement had been secured in early October, US and Chinese officials have been haggling over the details, including where a deal would be signed and whether Washington would roll back existing levies as part of such a settlement.


Mr Trump said a “significant phase one deal with China” remained “close” and “could happen soon”, as Beijing was “dying to make a deal”. But he also warned that higher levies would follow if the talks faltered.

I tell it to everybody: If we don’t make a deal, we’re going to substantially raise those tariffs

President Donald Trump on US trade talks with China
The US has placed 25 per cent tariffs on $250bn of Chinese imports and 15 per cent tariffs on a further $112bn of Chinese goods. It has threatened new 15 per cent tariffs on a further $156bn of Chinese products in December. 

“I tell it to everybody: If we don’t make a deal, we’re going to substantially raise those tariffs, they are going to be raised very substantially,” Mr Trump warned. 

Mr Trump used the speech in New York, his hometown, to defend his administration’s protectionist trade policies and his economic record ahead of next year’s presidential election campaign

He said his administration had “delivered on our promises and exceeded our expectations” after nearly three years in office, but blamed the Federal Reserve for restraining growth under his watch. 

The president, who has frequently challenged the Fed’s independence by demanding easier monetary policy, said the US was at a “competitive disadvantage” because it had not followed the eurozone into the land of negative rates. 

“Give some of that money, I want some of that money,” he said. The Fed has cut interest rates three times this year, after raising them last year, but has since suggested it will pause easing for the time being. 

Mr Trump’s remarks came at a pivotal moment in his presidency, on the eve of public impeachment hearings over the Ukraine scandal in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and less than a year from the 2020 presidential election. Mr Trump wants to tout his economic prowess as a key selling point in the 2020 campaign, in a bid to hold on to the swing voters who propelled him to the White House in the race against Hillary Clinton in 2016. 

“We have ended the war on American workers, we have stopped the assault on American industry, and we have launched an economic boom the likes of which we have never seen before,” Mr Trump said. 

Despite record highs in US stock markets, persistently low unemployment and strong consumption, there have been some warning signs for the US president about the health of the economy. The pace of growth has slowed throughout the year, with both agricultural producers and manufacturers in the American heartland bearing the brunt of the trade wars and weakening global output. 

This has exposed Mr Trump to criticism from Democrats that his policies have backfired, failing to live up to their promise of boosting the prospects of average middle-class households Despite all the pressure exerted through tariffs, the US administration has failed to secure any major concessions from China on the toughest trade issues like industrial subsidies and the theft of intellectual property. 

US agrees limited trade deal with China
Andy Green, managing director for economic policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think-tank, said: “This laughable cheerleading in front of Wall Street pretty much sums up Trump’s economic agenda: no real results for the country at large, but delivering for the titans of Wall Street and corporate monopolies.”

Mr Trump’s more pugnacious, protectionist approach to trade has been a cornerstone of his economic agenda from the beginning of his presidency — and many businesses have complained that the uncertainty it created has frozen their investment plans.

But Mr Trump appeared to reject those claims. He said: “They were totally down. Now they’re a little bit down because a little bit, perhaps, the uncertainty of trade wars. But there is no uncertainty.”

As they await word on the US-China talks, investors and officials are also closely watching Mr Trump’s decision, expected this week, on whether to impose tariffs on car imports, after labelling them a threat to national security.

So China could potentially lose ALL exports to the USA and make it up again in growth within a few months.

If we suspect for a moment that Trump isn't completely inept, then going in with a losing strategy with no chance of succeeding could be a sign that there are other hidden motives.

Contradictory demands by American negotiators make it impossible to meet American demands.

China is really the only military antagonist to the USA that could potentially challenge the status quo in the near future.

Instead of thinking about decoupling as a byproduct of the trade war, there is a possibility that it was the original intent, packaged in a way that the American people could swallow.

For years, conventional thinking was that future war between the USA and China is impossible because the two economies are so closely tied together.

China is really the only military antagonist to the USA that could potentially challenge the status quo in the near future.

Instead of thinking about decoupling as a byproduct of the trade war, there is a possibility that it was the original intent, packaged in a way that the American people could swallow.

For years, conventional thinking was that future war between the USA and China is impossible because the two economies are so closely tied together.

I believe that this could this decoupling could be intentional on the part of the US leadership to prepare for anticipated conflicts in the South China Sea and on Taiwan with China.",neutral,0.3759152293205261,0.5970850586891174,0.026999693363904953,-0.34891554713249207,-0.34891554713249207

dtz788,An Israeli twist on the belt and road initiative,"Disclaimer : all data in this write-up is based on open source information it includes my personal opinions about global affairs and my understanding of other people's motivations.

The traditional method: the belt end road initiative is one of the biggest most  famous geopolitical ploys in the 21st century. 
  
It is the bedrock of Chinese planning in the  Chinese agenda towards the rest of Eurasia and Africa. 

Traditionally goes something like this: third world country needs infrastructure lacks financing capability  industrial and political will to create said infrastructure. 

Chinese state Banks give out a loan Chinese SOE use Chinese labor to build said infrastructure project in the target state. 

If the target state can afford to pay back China for the loan win-win happens.

If the target state cannot afford to pay back China for the loan a debt  trap happens. 

States stuck in a  debt trap towards China are forced to make concessions political economic or both

China will usually confiscate the new infrastructure product and use it for its own benefit other options include taking over profitable mining licences other industries China is interested in the target state

In particularly important cases China is even willing to restructure States debt to get political concessions

Anyway you slice it China still wins the money stays within the Chinese system because Chinese Banks pay Chinese soe that  use Chinese labor . 


Many birds one stone: 
 1) China uses its excess capacity in concrete iron     and affiliated construction industry . 

2) many developing States willingly transition to Chinese standards both in  physical and information infrastructure.

3) china gains a lot of Goodwill especially in cash-strapped sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia but everywhere else in Eurasia included.

4) belt and road limits Chinese exposure to American naval blockade and create an alternative trade routes for energy minerals and finished goods away from the United States and its allies. 

Israel offers a unique look at  the effects of Belt and  road and the ways in which first world countries can  use the Chinese initiative to better themselves without exposing themselves to the  strategic risks inherent in the scheme . 

So Israel has some unique features first like China Israel has only recently become a wealthy state.

 Israel doesn't have an infrastructure legacy dating back to the industrial Revolution like many European States .

Probably only by the mid-nineties would be the time frame Israel could afford to start serious infrastructure modernization  as a result of wars  military expenditure and basic state formation duties . 

Israeli regulatory framework is also unique an interesting mix of American and European style  regulations depending on the partners most involved in that particular sector of the economy of Israel. 

To keep Israeli growth going and avoid bottlenecks and other issues in the economy Israel needed and still  needs lots of new infrastructure

The Chinese were more than welcome to join this trend. 

 what israel does different: 

1) open bids : Israel doesn't give Chinese companies license to build infrastructure in Israel uses open bidding process to choose the best offering regardless of the nationality of the contractor

2) Israeli cash : as a first world state with low  German style debt-to-gdp high growth and 120 billion dollars in reserve Israel has no need to take money from the Chinese government and its affiliated Banks Israel has great economic resources at its disposal and when lacking can easily borrow money in the international market. 

 3) Israeli  planning: all infrastructure projects in Israel are designed by  Israeli and / or other Western architects and engineers to fit  Israeli needs and not Chinese ones . 

4) Western standards: all foreign firms bidding on major government contracts in Israel are forced by law to have an israeli  partner to do quality control and ensure the project lives up to  the standards specified . 

This sounds great many of you may start to wonder  why does China agree to work under those conditions why not force Israel enter standard Chinese practices in dealing with infrastructure projects. 

Real win win :

1) Israeli cash means that China takes no risk political or economic in doing business in  Israel the Israeli government works directly with Chinese soe  avoiding the Chinese banking system all together. 

2) Israeli project management and quality control allow Chinese companies to learn how to do business in an advanced market successfully a great experience for the future of Chinese  infrastructure . 

3) while poor in mineral wealth and energy Israel is an important source of technology and investment for China almost equal to the big three in Europe despite its small size. 


4) Israeli industrial innovation agrotech water tech are incredibly useful and sometimes provide the only alternative source for new ideas outside of the United States of America and silicon valley. 

To conclude Israeli Chinese infrastructure cooperation and cooperation  in general are very valuable to both sides 

Israel successfully navigated its own needs American pressure and Chinese interests to create customized  version of 

"" belt and road "" made to defend the needs and wants of an advanced state with strong pro-western inclinations.

Israeli Chinese economic partnership should be a model in  how other western  successful states deal with china . 

ask anything you like on the subject I'll be glad to answer any questions.

Some think it is a colossal waste of money (i.e. China is throwing money down the drain), the other camp believes it is a sinister plot to take over the World, similar to what the British East India Company did in the 17th and 18th Centuries.

If the second opinion is true, then how can China impose its will on the rest of the World when its navy lacks power projection capabilities and several other navies can frustrate any such plans?

I listened to a Kenyan importer explain that with the completion of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), shipping times from China to Kenya could be shorted by weeks. He see's how that facilitates his business (East Africa is on the shores of the Indian Ocean) - but if this project is a colossal waste of money with no strategic value, does that assume he doesn't know what he's talking about  - or that the market he serves and others like him serve is too irrelevant to be strategically useful?

cd66xu,Questions about the long-term impact of China's Belt & Road Initiative,"I wonder what effect China's Belt & Road Initiative will have on the world economy, trade, and influence. China is spending trillions of dollars to build roads, bridges, railroads, pipelines, and ports connecting China to Europe and Africa. So far, many countries have signed up for this infrastructure improvements because China has few strings attached to the loans such as insisting on better human rights or fair elections. The countries thought that this would mean more construction jobs for their citizens, but China insists these projects be built with Chinese companies and labor. Also, there has been charges of corruption. I thought that the long-term strategy was to sell their products to prop up their manufacturing jobs and improve their economy while bypassing and isolating the US. Once China controls the host country's ports, they can start to meddle in the internal politics of that country and exert pressure. We are already seeing [signs](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/04/01/china-warned-countries-not-attend-un-meeting-xinjiang-human-rights-violations/) of this behavior. However, the countries signed up to get this infrastructure money are getting nervous. When they don't or can't repay China, then China is seizing their assets. Countries are increasingly starting to view the Belt & Road Initiative as a “debt trap” and “new colonialism.”

I have some questions regarding the long-term implications of this Initiative.

1.What effect will this have on the EU? China has contracts with the Balkan countries and is buying up European ports. Will China exert greater influence on European politics? Will China fracture the EU even more with some countries succumbing to China's influence and other countries trying not to? Could it split allies? What happens to the economics of the EU if countries like Italy cannot repay their loans to China?

2.Could this bankrupt China? Many of the projects cost large sums in loans to small countries that cannot pay back those loans, what are the odds that this will undermine China's banks? We saw the first bank failure a few weeks ago. Could this crash their economy?

3.When all roads lead to Rome, then armies can march on those roads...in both directions.

cvbghy,Can the President Order Firms to Leave China?,"US President Donald Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1164914959131848705) on Friday that he is ordering US firms to find an alternative to China and bring their business home to America.

Over the weekend, Trump [asserted](https://www.apnews.com/be18b8619cde4658a418dda4f416968a) that he holds such broad power thanks to the [International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Emergency_Economic_Powers_Act), a piece of legislation signed by President Jimmy Carter.

My questions:

1. What precedent, if any, supports Trump's position that POTUS can use a national emergency declaration to regulate and compel international trade? Or are there any precedents against the view?
2. What is the legal process by which an administration executes that law's provisions?
3. In light of the fact that China contributes billions to the earnings of US corporations like Apple, how could US firms challenge Trump's supposed legal authority if he does execute the order?
4.
