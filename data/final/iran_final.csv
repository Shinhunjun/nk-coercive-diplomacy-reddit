6oaqi1,Is Iran violating the nuclear deal? When do violations matter?,"Edit: I see people couldn't help but immediately downvote.

Bear with me, since I know this is unpopular (and may get downvoted to hell anyways). I've been seeing more and more people claiming lately that Iran, despite having been certified as complying with the Iran deal, has not actually been compliant. Certification is no guarantee, after all, since sometimes minor transgressions get overlooked in favor of certification of these types of things to preserve ties or because the costs of decertification are outweighed by the benefits of certification.

But I think it's worth looking into whether the Iran deal has been violated by Iran, since it helps understand the baseline at which countries may take action to decertify Iranian compliance, and can give us a sort of sneak peek into potential crises down the line.

So as I said, I started looking into claims of Iranian violations. The claims I've found are outlined by Republican Senators, who say that Iran has:

* Exceeded heavy water limits

* Exceeded limits on advanced centrifuges, and plans to expand the numbers even further

* Attempted to circumvent restrictions on acquisition of technology barred without UN Security Council approval

* Refusal to grant physical access to IAEA inspectors to Iranian facilities

So how credible are these accusations, and what is the context behind each?

The accusation about heavy water is easiest to investigate. Basically, [Iran has twice](https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-iran-exceeds-limits-heavy-water/3589850.html) exceeded the 130-ton limit on heavy water. Once, they had 130.1 tons, and the other time, it was 130.9. This is not all that concerning, and Iran dipped below the limit not long after. What *is* concerning is that heavy water, which can be used to create plutonium, is [being shipped out by Iran](http://www.dw.com/en/un-watchdog-iran-shipped-excess-heavy-water-to-comply-with-nuclear-deal/a-36671462), reportedly to Oman. While this doesn't violate the deal technically, it's a sizable and interesting loophole in the deal's text. So this matter doesn't seem dangerous, unless and until Iran starts bringing back heavy water it is storing elsewhere.

The second accusation, about nuclear centrifuges, is inherently difficult to verify. David Albright, head of the Institute for Science and International Security (unfortunately acronym'ed ISIS, since before ISIS was a thing), [testified to the US House of Representatives](http://isis-online.org/conferences/detail/house-subcommittee-testimony-of-david-albright-on-assessing-iran-nuclear-de/) on all of the alleged JCPOA violations. When he got to mention of the centrifuges, he noted another deal ambiguity. The deal allows for ""roughly 10"" IR-6 advanced centrifuges to be operated, but Iran is operating 15. This is based on the text of the secret Iran plan leaked to the Associated Press that goes along with the JCPOA, and is part of it. So Iran appears to have a violation here, if not a significant loophole yet again, but not a huge one at the moment.

The third issue is acquisition of technology. This is much more straightforward, and German intelligence has confirmed that Iran sought and seeks to procure dual-use materials that are barred to it under the JCPOA without UNSC approval. The deal states clearly that without UN Security Council approval, no state can transfer certain technology related to missile and nuclear technology to Iran, but Iran has sought to go outside of this channel and import illegally. Note: I am **not** calling missile tests a violation. Please don't bring up this straw man. But this is a pretty clear violation, though no one seems willing to act on it as of yet.

And finally fourth, the thing I found most interesting, is the report on claims that Iran is barring access to its nuclear sites by IAEA inspectors. Albright mentions this, saying that military sites are off-limits to IAEA personnel, which is a violation of the JCPOA. There is a dispute resolution mechanism for this, but it seems that the US and other states have not wanted to trigger it, again showing a cost-benefit analysis here, but a future point of serious contention. However, I've also noticed that the Sharif University visit is something that Albright reported on, not something the IAEA mentioned wanting to do. It's strange that I have found no mention of this proposed visit to a site, which means Albright may simply have incorrect information. However, there is also a curious lack of information regarding the Parchin site.

That's also rather unusual, so it seems possible that the IAEA is not publishing full results of its requests to visit Iranian sites, and may be sharing them secretly with states who are involved in JCPOA compliance.

The significant friction points that remain, in my view, are the possibility of a clash over IAEA inspectors in the future, as well as the possibility of clashing over Iranian centrifuges. However, as many have noted, Iran's commitment to the heavy water limits has strengthened, and they went comfortably below the limit by the next report, likely in an attempt to avoid scrutiny by the new administration while waiting to see what the orange guy's ""tougher approach"" to compliance would be.

At what point, though, will this lead to friction? Is it possible that Trump is so preoccupied with whatever it is he's looking at that he'll give Iran more leeway? And will Europe respond if another German report comes out saying Iran is trying to circumvent restrictions on technology imposed by the deal, or will it just wait until Iran seeks a nuclear weapon, at which point it may be too late?",tayaravaknin,geopolitics,7,41,1500491423,/r/geopolitics/comments/6oaqi1/is_iran_violating_the_nuclear_deal_when_do/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/6oaqi1/is_iran_violating_the_nuclear_deal_when_do/,P1_PreSingapore,iran,2025-12-08 23:51:02,2017-07-19 19:10:23,2017-07,"Is Iran violating the nuclear deal? When do violations matter? Edit: I see people couldn't help but immediately downvote.

Bear with me, since I know this is unpopular (and may get downvoted to hell anyways). I've been seeing more and more people claiming lately that Iran, despite having been certified as complying with the Iran deal, has not actually been compliant. Certification is no guarantee, after all, since sometimes minor transgressions get overlooked in favor of certification of these types of things to preserve ties or because the costs of decertification are outweighed by the benefits of certification.

But I think it's worth looking into whether the Iran deal has been violated by Iran, since it helps understand the baseline at which countries may take action to decertify Iranian compliance, and can give us a sort of sneak peek into potential crises down the line.

So as I said, I started looking into claims of Iranian violations. The claims I've found are outlined by Republican Senators, who say that Iran has:

* Exceeded heavy water limits

* Exceeded limits on advanced centrifuges, and plans to expand the numbers even further

* Attempted to circumvent restrictions on acquisition of technology barred without UN Security Council approval

* Refusal to grant physical access to IAEA inspectors to Iranian facilities

So how credible are these accusations, and what is the context behind each?

The accusation about heavy water is easiest to investigate. Basically, [Iran has twice](https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-iran-exceeds-limits-heavy-water/3589850.html) exceeded the 130-ton limit on heavy water. Once, they had 130.1 tons, and the other time, it was 130.9. This is not all that concerning, and Iran dipped below the limit not long after. What *is* concerning is that heavy water, which can be used to create plutonium, is [being shipped out by Iran](http://www.dw.com/en/un-watchdog-iran-shipped-excess-heavy-water-to-comply-with-nuclear-deal/a-36671462), reportedly to Oman. While this doesn't violate the deal technically, it's a sizable and interesting loophole in the deal's text. So this matter doesn't seem dangerous, unless and until Iran starts bringing back heavy water it is storing elsewhere.

The second accusation, about nuclear centrifuges, is inherently difficult to verify. David Albright, head of the Institute for Science and International Security (unfortunately acronym'ed ISIS, since before ISIS was a thing), [testified to the US House of Representatives](http://isis-online.org/conferences/detail/house-subcommittee-testimony-of-david-albright-on-assessing-iran-nuclear-de/) on all of the alleged JCPOA violations. When he got to mention of the centrifuges, he noted another deal ambiguity. The deal allows for ""roughly 10"" IR-6 advanced centrifuges to be operated, but Iran is operating 15. This is based on the text of the secret Iran plan leaked to the Associated Press that goes along with the JCPOA, and is part of it. So Iran appears to have a violation here, if not a significant loophole yet again, but not a huge one at the moment.

The third issue is acquisition of technology. This is much more straightforward, and German intelligence has confirmed that Iran sought and seeks to procure dual-use materials that are barred to it under the JCPOA without UNSC approval. The deal states clearly that without UN Security Council approval, no state can transfer certain technology related to missile and nuclear technology to Iran, but Iran has sought to go outside of this channel and import illegally. Note: I am **not** calling missile tests a violation. Please don't bring up this straw man. But this is a pretty clear violation, though no one seems willing to act on it as of yet.

And finally fourth, the thing I found most interesting, is the report on claims that Iran is barring access to its nuclear sites by IAEA inspectors. Albright mentions this, saying that military sites are off-limits to IAEA personnel, which is a violation of the JCPOA. There is a dispute resolution mechanism for this, but it seems that the US and other states have not wanted to trigger it, again showing a cost-benefit analysis here, but a future point of serious contention. However, I've also noticed that the Sharif University visit is something that Albright reported on, not something the IAEA mentioned wanting to do. It's strange that I have found no mention of this proposed visit to a site, which means Albright may simply have incorrect information. However, there is also a curious lack of information regarding the Parchin site. IAEA inspectors [found uranium at Parchin](https://www.wsj.com/articles/uranium-provides-new-clue-on-irans-past-nuclear-arms-work-1466380760), which the Iranians insisted never housed any nuclear work, but there has been no follow-up visit to the site to ascertain the origin of the uranium samples, which the IAEA said was uncertain. That's also rather unusual, so it seems possible that the IAEA is not publishing full results of its requests to visit Iranian sites, and may be sharing them secretly with states who are involved in JCPOA compliance.

The significant friction points that remain, in my view, are the possibility of a clash over IAEA inspectors in the future, as well as the possibility of clashing over Iranian centrifuges. However, as many have noted, Iran's commitment to the heavy water limits has strengthened, and they went comfortably below the limit by the next report, likely in an attempt to avoid scrutiny by the new administration while waiting to see what the orange guy's ""tougher approach"" to compliance would be.

[Politico reports that](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/obama-hezbollah-drug-trafficking-investigation/):

>When Project Cassandra leaders sought approval for some significant investigations, prosecutions, arrests and financial sanctions, officials at the Justice and Treasury departments delayed, hindered or rejected their requests.

>The Justice Department declined requests by Project Cassandra and other authorities to file criminal charges against major players such as Hezbollah’s high-profile envoy to Iran, a Lebanese bank that allegedly laundered billions in alleged drug profits, and a central player in a U.S.-based cell of the Iranian paramilitary Quds force. And the State Department rejected requests to lure high-value targets to countries where they could be arrested.

David Asher, a Defense Department illicit finance expert who worked on Project Cassandra, said about the decisions which hindered the project: 

>""This was a policy decision, it was a systematic decision. They serially ripped apart this entire effort that was very well supported and resourced, and it was done from the top down.""

John Brennan, Obama's top counterterrorism adviser and then CIA director wrote that:

>“the next president has the opportunity to set a new course for relations between the two countries” through not only a direct dialogue, but “greater assimilation of Hezbollah into Lebanon’s political system.”

Why would Brennan want Hezbollah to have more political power?

In 2010, Reuters reported that at a conference in Washington, Brennan said:

>“Hezbollah is a very interesting organization,” Brennan told a Washington conference, citing its evolution from “purely a terrorist organization” to a militia to an organization that now has members within the parliament and the cabinet.

>“There is certainly the elements of Hezbollah that are truly a concern to us what they’re doing. And what we need to do is to find ways to diminish their influence within the organization and to try to build up the more moderate elements,” Brennan said.

Ali Fayad, A Lebanese arms dealer ""who had been indicted in U.S. courts on charges of planning the murders of U.S. government employees, attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization and attempting to acquire, transfer and use anti-aircraft missiles"" was arrested in Prague in 2014. He was in custody for 2 years, but

>top Obama administration officials declined to apply serious pressure on the Czech government to extradite him to the United States, even as Putin was lobbying aggressively against it.

>He is now believed by U.S. officials to be back in business, and helping to arm militants in Syria and elsewhere with Russian heavy weapons.

Katherine Bauer, a Treasury official under Obama, [testified in February 2017](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4329058-Katherine-Bauer-testimony-to-the-House-Committee.html) that

>“under the Obama administration … these [Hezbollah-related] investigations were tamped down for fear of rocking the boat with Iran and jeopardizing the nuclear deal.”

Politico adds to this by reporting:

>As a result, some Hezbollah operatives were not pursued via arrests, indictments, or Treasury designations that would have blocked their access to U.S. financial markets, according to Bauer, a career Treasury official, who served briefly in its Office of Terrorist Financing as a senior policy adviser for Iran before leaving in late 2015. And other “Hezbollah facilitators” arrested in France, Colombia, Lithuania have not been extradited — or indicted — in the U.S., she wrote.

David Asher said that

>“The closer we got to the [Iran deal], the more these activities went away. So much of the capability, whether it was special operations, whether it was law enforcement, whether it was [Treasury] designations — even the capacity, the personnel assigned to this mission — it was assiduously drained, almost to the last drop, by the end of the Obama administration.”

After the Iran deal was put into place,

>within months, task force officials said, Project Cassandra was all but dead. Some of its most senior officials, including Jack Kelly, the veteran DEA supervisory agent who created and led the task force, were transferred to other assignments. And Asher himself left the task force long before that, after the Defense Department said his contract would not be renewed.

>As a result, the U.S. government lost insight into not only drug trafficking and other criminal activity worldwide, but also into Hezbollah’s illicit conspiracies with top officials in the Iranian, Syrian, Venezuelan and Russian governments — all the way up to presidents Nicolas Maduro, Assad and Putin, according to former task force members and other current and former U.S. officials.

Derek Maltz, who oversaw Project Cassandra as the head of the DEA’s Special Operations Division for nine years, said:

>“Certainly there are targets that people feel that could have been indicted and weren’t. There is certainly an argument to be made that if tomorrow all the agencies were ordered to come together and sit in a room and put all the evidence on the table against all these bad guys, that there could be a hell of a lot of indictments.”

>“There’s no doubt in my mind now that the focus was this Iran deal and our initiative was kind of like a fly in the soup,”

Katherine Bauer, a Treasury official under Obama, [testified in February 2017](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4329058-Katherine-Bauer-testimony-to-the-House-Committee.html) that

>“under the Obama administration … these [Hezbollah-related] investigations were tamped down for fear of rocking the boat with Iran and jeopardizing the nuclear deal.”

Politico adds to this by reporting:

>As a result, some Hezbollah operatives were not pursued via arrests, indictments, or Treasury designations that would have blocked their access to U.S. financial markets, according to Bauer, a career Treasury official, who served briefly in its Office of Terrorist Financing as a senior policy adviser for Iran before leaving in late 2015. And other “Hezbollah facilitators” arrested in France, Colombia, Lithuania have not been extradited — or indicted — in the U.S., she wrote.

David Asher said that

>“The closer we got to the [Iran deal], the more these activities went away. So much of the capability, whether it was special operations, whether it was law enforcement, whether it was [Treasury] designations — even the capacity, the personnel assigned to this mission — it was assiduously drained, almost to the last drop, by the end of the Obama administration.”

After the Iran deal was put into place,

>within months, task force officials said, Project Cassandra was all but dead. Some of its most senior officials, including Jack Kelly, the veteran DEA supervisory agent who created and led the task force, were transferred to other assignments. And Asher himself left the task force long before that, after the Defense Department said his contract would not be renewed.

>As a result, the U.S. government lost insight into not only drug trafficking and other criminal activity worldwide, but also into Hezbollah’s illicit conspiracies with top officials in the Iranian, Syrian, Venezuelan and Russian governments — all the way up to presidents Nicolas Maduro, Assad and Putin, according to former task force members and other current and former U.S. officials.

Derek Maltz, who oversaw Project Cassandra as the head of the DEA’s Special Operations Division for nine years, said:

>“Certainly there are targets that people feel that could have been indicted and weren’t. There is certainly an argument to be made that if tomorrow all the agencies were ordered to come together and sit in a room and put all the evidence on the table against all these bad guys, that there could be a hell of a lot of indictments.”

>“There’s no doubt in my mind now that the focus was this Iran deal and our initiative was kind of like a fly in the soup,”

92eue1,Which countries/companies do you think will comply with the American sanctions against Iran?,"Before the U.S ceased its participation from the JCPOA, multiple companies and individuals tried to get around the sanctions and they received a strong reaction from the U.S. I remember that multiple European Banks paid fines, Chinese mobile giant ZTE ended up paying a $1 billion fine.

As far as I know no country openly traded with sanctioned Iranian enterprises, because lots of foreign governments own American bonds. That said, I wouldn't be surprised if Cuban or Venezuelan governments did.

The sanctions are more complicated than "" Are you trading with Iran? If so, now pay fines"". Companies/Banks doing business with companies that trading with Iran also suffer from the consequences, its very difficult to get around this. For example: Turkish-Iranian businessman Reza Zarrab tried to launder money from his trade with Iran in Turkey, and now he is in an American prison with the banker helped him in money laundering.

Lets say that a country created an isolated company that only trades with Iran and decided not to spend or invest its revenue on anything or on very specific goods. Theoretically its possible, Europeans were discussing a similar plan. Its not financially wise not to do anything with your money, could this be a reasonable gamble if you are hoping embargo to be lifted in near future?  As far as I know, the laws don't work like that(one would argue the defendant has a right to benefit from changes in laws when its in his favor),  otherwise ZTE's fine would be lifted when the JCPOA was signed. If there is truly a way to get around this, who can guarantee the U.S won't find other ways to retaliate?

Personally, I only expect companies from countries already under American sanctions and the companies from countries with a small trade volume with the U.S not to comply with the sanctions. Iranian main export is gas and it could be bought from anyone, but for some countries exporting goods to Iran would be profitable. Potentially companies from especially Russia where part of finance sector is already under American sanctions and Turkey, a country doesn't export much to the U.S and would profit from ignoring the sanctions, may go for it.

With the Israeli defense minister in Russia this week, recent affirmations by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of the desire for 'mutual' 'two-way street' withdrawal of foreign forces from Syria and that no foreign forces should be involved in the next Syrian offensive, and the lack of serious action by Russia regarding Israeli strikes into Syria, it would seem to show that Israel and Russia have been able to come to a reasonable understanding regarding each other's interests.

*[...] Lavrov said at a press conference on May 28, 2018, in what appeared to be a statement pointed at both the United States and Iran. “The result of this work which should continue and is continuing should be a situation when representatives of the Syrian Arab Republic’s army stand at Syria’s border with Israel.”*

But how will this effect the United States' role in Syria, and their forces currently stationed in the country? Will the US accede to a withdrawal that would allow the SAA to advance, even if allies Israel and Jordan sign-off? And how deep really is the Israeli-Russian relationship, and how can Russia realistically balance its role as partner with both Iran and Israel?

8iscrx,I'm trying to understand the Iran Nuclear Deal and I have some questions,"This past week was finals week for me, but nonetheless I did some reading on the Iran Deal when I had the free time. I knew family and friends would be talking about it more, so knowing that I wanted to read some information on it so I could have more of an informed opinion. 

The Deal itself seems straightforward - cutting Iran's nuclear resources/supply, and lifting sanctions placed by Western countries as an incentive for Iran to abide by the Deal.  Checks and balances were put in place as another means to prevent Iran from cheating. Intricate details aside... in my (perhaps) limited understanding, I feel like the Deal makes sense. 

However, there are aspects relating to the deal that are not so clear to me. My questions are:

1) One of Trump's claims was that Iran is not adhering to the spirit of the deal by continuing to work on ballistic missiles and engage in sparse military actions in the Middle East. What is ""the spirit of the deal""? Did all countries involved agree to ""the spirit of the deal""?

2) Is there a way to measure adherence to ""the spirit of the deal""?

3) I have read claims here and there that this Deal ""is a death sentence for Israel"" and that it ""paves the way for Iran to develop nuclear weapons"".

c0plzb,Trump's non-response against Persian Gulf attacks,"Two tankers originating from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were hit by sabotage attacks, just one month after four tankers anchored off the UAE coast were targeted by what international investigators say was almost certainly a state actor. This time, the attacks were carried out in broad daylight and while the vessels were exiting the Strait of Hormuz at full speed. 

The Norwegian-owned, Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Front Altair was badly damaged by an attack that left a column of smoke rising from its hull. With a capacity of 110,000 deadweight tons, the medium-size Aframax crude carrier was sailing from Abu Dhabi’s al-Ruwais refinery to Taiwan with a 75,000-ton cargo of naphtha, a slow-burning petroleum product used as feedstock at refineries. Photos and aerial footage appeared to show a point of impact in the middle of the ship, but also significant fire damage to the accommodation island and engine room, suggesting the tanker was subjected to multiple attacks that will likely render it a total loss (though it appears to have maintained its structural integrity for the time being).

About an hour later, a second tanker was attacked about seventy nautical miles from Fujairah and fourteen nautical miles off Iran’s coast just south of Jask, not far from the first attack. The Japanese-owned, Panamanian-flagged Kokuka Courageous, a smaller 27,000-deadweight-ton vessel, was sailing from the Saudi port of Jubail to Singapore with a cargo of methanol. A waterline breach in its starboard hull caused a fire in the engine room; the vessel is apparently taking in water, though the cargo is reportedly intact.

The two attacks occurred less than fifty kilometers from each other and just outside Iran’s territorial waters, under the watchful eyes of Iranian radar and monitoring stations. Although the attacks appeared to come from the west side of the ships, their location was suspiciously close to important Iranian naval facilities at Jask. If the copious evidence of Iranian involvement proves true, what does the incident say about Iran’s near-term intentions in the area?

Initial reports suggested the tankers may have been hit with torpedoes or surface attacks, but credible eyewitness reports indicate that explosives were attached to their hulls using speedboats (whose wakes could have been mistaken for torpedoes to the untrained eye). The crew of the Kokuka Courageous abandoned ship after they discovered an unexploded device still clinging to the hull; surveillance footage released by the US Navy showed a speedboat manned by Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy personnel trying to remove the device. Iran has yet to disclose the discovery of such an important piece of evidence.  

The Altair crew were rescued by the regular Iranian navy and taken to Jask and then Bandar Abbas, while sailors from Kokuka Courageous were eventually taken in by the American guided missile destroyer USS Bainbridge. It is not known whether the footage of the explosive’s removal was taken before or after the sailors were rescued.

At a subsequent news conference, the Japanese owner of Kokuka Courageous stated that the crew had detected high-speed flying objects approaching the ship right before the attack, suggesting that at least some of the explosions may have been caused by explosive-laden suicide drones. Iran has a military airstrip about fifty kilometers northeast of the attack location that is frequently used to operate drones. As for the planted explosives, they seem to have been timed to detonate just after the tankers cleared the Strait of Hormuz, but still in proximity to Iranian waters.

These facts, coupled with the amount of coordination required to carry out such operations, leave little doubt that Iran is once again the culprit. As happened during Persian Gulf naval confrontations with the United States in the 1980s, Iranian leaders are not expected to take responsibility for the actions of their forces in local waters. In the past, they have credited attacks to “the hand of God” or blamed Western countries for mining incidents, only to take credit for them later (e.g., off the coast of Fujairah in 1987). It would come as little surprise to hear them make similar claims today (Iran’s UN mission has already blamed the United States for the explosions, while a maritime agency official claimed that “technical problems” most likely caused the fires on both ships).


The increasing momentum of the US financial pressure campaign has prompted Iran to react more aggressively of late. In a May 29 speech, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei declared that the “only way” to gain strategic leverage over America is to beat Washington at its own game of pressure (not through negotiations, which Khamenei described as the preferred US tactic), but rather through “our own tools of leverage,” including “military tools.” He promised to use more such tools if the regime’s recent threat to resume certain nuclear activities did not yield the desired result of easing sanctions and helping Iran’s economy. Given such rhetoric, it is difficult to view the latest attacks as anything but the regime doing just what Khamenei said it would.

The tanker incidents could also be seen as an attempt to challenge America’s measured deterrence and its position as a superpower. Indeed, if the attacks go unanswered, they could undermine US credibility among its regional allies. At the same time, Tehran presumably hopes to manage escalation, maintain the element of surprise, and preserve plausible deniability. The latter goal may explain why Iran rushed to rescue some of the stranded sailors, who might also serve as human shields if the United States or other actors launch retaliatory action.

The attacks also coincided with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe’s much-anticipated visit to Tehran, raising speculation that Iran targeted a Japanese ship to send a bold and clear message of dissatisfaction with Tokyo’s role in upholding US sanctions. Just hours before the attacks, Khamenei publicly declared that President Trump was not worth exchanging messages with, a seemingly direct slap at Prime Minister Abe, who was rumored to be carrying a message from the White House for Iran. This tactic would be in keeping with the IRGC’s penchant for undermining and humiliating Iran’s own Foreign Ministry whenever a domestic scapegoat is needed to absorb blame.

The nature of the tankers’ cargo sheds further light on how far the Ayatollah may be willing to go. The Kokuka Courageous is a type 2 chemical tanker clearly marked to carry products that pose severe environmental and safety hazards. A premeditated attack against such a vessel shows complete disregard for the significant environmental and human damage that spilling such products could cause. One can therefore expect future attacks to raise the risk of oil slicks and other such problems.

Moreover, al-Ruwais refinery, the origin of one of the tankers, is considered a major regional competitor to Iran’s petrochemical industry and a major beneficiary if new sanctions on Iran’s petrochemical exports wind up having a severe impact on the regime’s bottom line. In that sense, the attacks could have been designed as direct retaliation against those sanctions. The broader warning seems clear: that the region should not expect calm at a time when Iran’s oil export revenues are falling to record lows and its petrochemical revenues are threatening to do the same. Rather, the regime’s disruptive measures may gradually expand in size, geography, and complexity, perhaps even extending to military targets. 

During an interview this morning, president Trump said Iran did it, but the US [won't do anything](https://youtu.be/rx5hA9G_bac) about it.

 I am the host of the All Things Interesting podcast and will be interviewing Jay Solomon, a former chief foreign correspondent for the WSJ who has covered both national security and U.S. foreign policy. He is an expert on Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programs and weapons proliferation networks in the Middle East. He has also written multiple books on the geopolitics and covert wars within the region.
 
With the recent events in Saudi Arabia this past week, I wanted to reach out to the community to gather questions you all might have as it relates to the current Middle East conflicts, nuclear proliferation, North Korea and Iranian nuclear weapons development, Middle East links to the North Korean military system, and foreign policy/national security in general.
 
I look forward to hearing everyone's questions and to sharing the episode once it's available.
