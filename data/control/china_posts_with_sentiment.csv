c4rjeg,"Why is the US more concerned about a Middle East hegemon and WMDs than Europe, Russia and China?","Why is the US more concerned about a Middle East hegemon and WMDs than Europe, Russia and China?

&#x200B;

Throughout the Cold War the US has relied on the Middle East for secure oil supplies in case of a war with the Soviet Union. The US feared the Soviets or another Middle East power such as Nasser's Arab Republic taking over and the US could no longer effectively fuel their tanks and aircraft in an arms race. The US allied with Saudi Arabia, a rather non-nationalistic, non-populist state, that would provide them oil, and the US would provide them security. US also allied with Israel by the time of the 1970s, since Israel was an effective buffer against Arab states and provided intelligence on both regional threats and terrorists.

Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the conventional large scale military threat was gone. However on 9/11, the US got a taste that history was not over and the new century has come. The US feared that terrorists would take control of Saudi Arabia and other Arab states and also feared they would get WMDs, ie. the invasion if Iraq and Afghanistan.

However, by the time of 2014, the shale revolution had begun and the US no longer relied on oil from the Middle East. China and Europe still relied on the Middle East for oil supplies. However, it seems like the US is still the most involved in the Middle East, why is this? Also the US is really concerned about WMDs still, why is this?

The theory if Iran did control the Middle East, a Russian-Iran block will be formed. Also Europe could get its oil supplies from Africa and China from Russia. US propting up Saudi Arabia is a good way to keep China and Europe in check in theory.

The first theory makes more sense. Historically, the US has always represented the anti-nationalist pro-globalization force, while Russia has been a the nationalist force, the US being very capital rich and suited for global trade while the colder more isolated Russia has been less open. US props up capital rich proxies while Russia props up nationalist ones. Saudi Arabia is an unstable state by design and it is very reliant on the United States for trade and security. A nationalist state in the Middle East like Iran would always back a state like Russia. Russia would provide Iran with weapons and security while Iran would join Russia's sphere of influence. China would have no choice but to side with the this new Eurasian alliance, them being a vital trading partner and a supplier of oil.",Mrbsct,geopolitics,24,31,1561395983,/r/geopolitics/comments/c4rjeg/why_is_the_us_more_concerned_about_a_middle_east/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/c4rjeg/why_is_the_us_more_concerned_about_a_middle_east/,china,2025-12-07 13:36:36,"Why is the US more concerned about a Middle East hegemon and WMDs than Europe, Russia and China?

bspbvl,Did China overlook ideological differences?

Despite the desire for free trade, it seems like the EU and Canada and Australia and being pro-US despite it not benefiting their economies.

b9taty,Presence of Chinese vessels around Pag-asa Island 'illegal',"Over 600 Chinese vessels have been circling Pag-asa Island since January this year, the military said. 

Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo on Monday said Manila has already filed a diplomatic protest on the incursions. He did not provide more details. 

China has ramped up island building and militarization activities in the  South China Sea, shunning a July 2016 ruling of a United Nations-backed arbitral tribunal that invalidated its nine-dash line claim over nearly  all of the waters.

**Comments / significance:**

* *China does not recognize Philippine claims and cites how Chinese vessels have fished in the area for over a hundred years.*
* *The use of 100's of Chinese fishing boats clogs up fishing waters for Philippines.  China can place these fishing vessels under Chinese Navy control in times of war or crisis.*

b2quz3,Some thoughts on the evolving pro-Chinese presence in this subreddit [Meta],"By now I'm sure quite a few of us have read the Buzzfeed News article about Reddit and this subreddit in particular being a place where discourse has been increasingly ""pro-Chinese"". I've been part of this subreddit for about 3 years now, and for better or worse my area of interest (being Chinese geopolitics and China related military development) and my activity on this subreddit has given me some slight profile, where I now feel obliged to discuss this elephant in the room. I've contacted /u/dieyoufool3 regarding this post and he's given me the nod to make it. I don't want to step on the mod team's toes and I think they've done a good job of running the subreddit overall to allow a variety of different arguments compete and be reviewed on the basis of the logic and merit of the arguments themselves. This may end up being a bit of a long textpost, so I apologize for that.

*Edit: seeing as I'm receiving a few comments about this -- I do not necessarily endorse or agree with the contents of the full Buzzfeed News article. However I do think it is a useful springboard for talking about what some people in this subreddit and on Reddit overall have been complaining about. To make it clear, the extent of my opinion is that this subreddit is technically more ""pro-China"" i.e.: less ""anti-China"" than the rest of Reddit tends to be. I lay this out in one of the paragraphs in point 1, however I want to put it clearly out here so no one misses it.*

======

This subreddit is a public space where competing ideas exist, but that nature means it is possible for third parties to try and artificially alter the route and form of the community's discussion and debate without participating it in good faith or without constructively contributing. I see three main challenges for the mod team here (but also indeed for any subreddit or community):

1. Intent of the user
2. Boundaries of discourse
3. Brigading and vote manipulation

I've been ruminating about this China specific issue on this subreddit for a while now. Part of the reason is because I have definitely noticed this subreddit has having a larger amount of individuals who are ""pro-Chinese"" than most average/default subreddits on Reddit. Another part of the reason is because I myself have been accused of being a propagandist, a wumao, a shill or a troll in the past as well. I'm aware of at least one individual who has even followed me on this account and created a subreddit to commentate and mock my activity. So I think now is a good time to start talking about the China discourse here openly. To start off;

&#x200B;

**1, Intent of the user:**

* This refers to whether a user on the subreddit is a real person who is part of this ""community"" and is interested in constructively contributing to it, rather than someone ""outside"" of the community, such as bots (which are obviously not people) or foreign ""shills"" (where their posts and contributions are a result of being paid or incentivized to post things they themselves may not believe in). Obviously for any community, the desire is to only have real people who are interested in having a genuine discussion.
* I imagine the mod team may have some resources to be able to identify which users are bots and/or replica accounts. I'm not sure if this may include IP identification or if it is more primitive like simply checking the history of the user (e.g.: many low effort contributions from day old accounts).
* Unfortunately, I think it's much more difficult to identify ""shills"" because it is impossible to identify an individual who is being paid to post about a particular belief or argument versus an individual who does genuinely believe about said belief or argument. Some people may suggest one way of tracking such individuals is by looking through their history, and if their post and comment history only revolves around discussing a particular set of topics, it may be a useful indicator to identify a ""shill"". On first glance that is not illogical, however I also think there are more than a few people who have used dedicated accounts to talk about these issues because they are interested in it -- in fact this particular account I've been using for the last few years is one I deliberately created to only talk about China related geopolitics and PLA developments, because my main Reddit account is one I use to browse other lighter, less intense topics (obviously I leave the two accounts well segregated). My main Reddit account also has some comments where it may be possible for me to be doxxed, and I'm sure I don't need to explain my caution around how some of my posts or comments may be received by some individuals who could end up being genuinely hostile.
* It is very easy to call someone you disagree with a shill, or a troll, a bot or a wumao or a propagandist, or brainwashed. I avoid doing so, because when that card is pulled, it is essentially the equivalent of forfeiting the argument as well as suggesting that the other person across the screen you are debating with is not a genuine person with genuine opinions. In a place where the purpose is to have constructive discussion, dismissing a person's belief in their opinion as fabricated is among the most egregious and low effort statements one can make.
* Finally, I feel obliged to speculate about the noted higher prevalence of ""pro-Chinese"" users on this subreddit versus the rest of the website (though I certainly don't think that group of users is anywhere near a majority of the 140k people here). People have understandably been concerned if this subreddit might be targeted by Chinese govt influence groups. Based on my time in the subreddit as well as based on a few people who have contacted me in the past, I hypothesize the higher prevalence of ""pro-Chinese"" users here is a reflection of greater interest in ""geopolitical"" matters from the overseas Chinese community in contemporary times compared to the past.
* Some people may have guessed this in the past, but I do have Chinese heritage in me (I won't disclose if it's part, half or whole), and as someone living in a ""western nation"" I have of course observed the way in which news media and commentary have written about China within the last decade or more (often in a context of power trajectory and/or geopolitics). That environment that in turn has led me to be interested in China related geopolitics. I obviously do not speak for all individuals with Chinese heritage, but I've been contacted by a few on this account who have described a similar trajectory of interest. In short, I wonder if Chinese individuals of a certain era living in the English speaking world may be on average more interested in geopolitics than other demographic groups on average -- and on Reddit the cross section of that means there may be a higher proportion of /r/geopolitics users of a Chinese background than elsewhere on Reddit, relatively speaking. However this is merely a hypothesis and not any sort of watertight argument. It is also very possible that this subreddit do not have a greater proportion individuals of a Chinese background than the rest of Reddit, but it merely attracts individuals who have a certain way of thinking or a worldview that causes this subreddit to seem more pro-Chinese than the rest of Reddit.

&#x200B;

**2, Boundaries of discourse**

* The moderators are free to choose what the boundaries of discussion are on this subreddit, which I think is an authority we do respect. The complex problem that is posed to them, is where to set those boundaries.
* Obviously everyone would agree that things like advocating for violence or genocide or denying the occurrence of historical atrocities would very much be beyond the pale. Similarly, posts including offensive language and personal attacks are also not appropriate for a subreddit with standards.
* But there are obviously many other topics were a range of opinions exist and consensus does not exist. For China related topics (given the focus of this post), this may include interpretations of the Tiananmen protests in 1989, to the legitimacy of the CCP and the Chinese govt, to the nature of the Chinese economy, as well as some more recent heated issues like Chinese re-education efforts in Xinjiang and the social credit system in the country. On the larger scale, topics of debate like the nature of the international legal order, the balance of power of the UN, the fairness of international financial institutions, are various other contentious topics we've seen debated here.
* Individuals of differing backgrounds will have differing opinions about a range of topics. Our opinions and worldviews are a reflection of the way we were socialized by family, friends, media, history and education. To my understanding, I believe this subreddit is open to having opinions from a range of different backgrounds contribute so long as they remain within clear boundaries. I do not believe this subreddit is an ""echo chamber"" that only exclusively pushes a single nation or group's views on all issues. In my opinion this is a good thing, because to have proper discussion about geopolitics one cannot merely only hear what you yourself believe but also what to hear what other groups believe. I myself have learned a lot from a number of users in this subreddit from different backgrounds, including people whose opinions I initially may have disagreed with.
* However, I also appreciate that sometimes merely allowing the debate of certain topics leads to the normalization of certain discourses. Something that was previously seen as completely indefensible may, after some debate, be seen as perhaps not entirely unreasonable under a certain set of circumstances.
* Wherever the moderators choose to set the boundaries either now or in the future, it is an unenviable task.

&#x200B;

**3, Brigading and vote manipulation**

* We all know what brigading and vote manipulation means. I'm not sure if other places have ever coordinated to deliberately manipulate votes or alter contributions or comments here. If so, that is obviously undesirable. I'm not sure how easy it is for the moderators to track this behaviour, but it is somewhat related to the issues of user intent from point 1.
* The infamous case of Unidan also showed us how easy it is for a few alt accounts to alter the vote trajectory of certain comments and to make them obscure. As a matter of principle I do not downvote comments that I disagree with or comments that I am engaged in a debate with. However receiving downvoting due to genuine individuals who disagree with a particular comment also happens, and I imagine it is difficult to distinguish that versus coordinated vote manipulation.
* The votes of a post or comment tend to be perceived as reflecting the amount of support it has. This is inherently tied to whether the contributing upvotes or downvotes to a certain post is a reflection of outside vote manipulation or if it a reflection of the actual demographics of the genuine user base. Hypothetically, if there was a way to determine that the votes of a comment or post are the result of the genuine user base, then the question to be asked is how comfortable the moderator team is in having that proportion of their user base holding those views -- i.e.: tying back to point 2.

=====

Given this subreddit is meant to talk about geopolitics, it is almost impossible to talk about geopolitics without occasionally talking about China related geopolitical events. Naturally there will be debate that follows.

I appreciate that a good portion of this subreddit's userbase likely resides in the western, English speaking world (with a higher proportion from that demographic as part of Reddit's overall userbase). It is likely that many of the arguments made from users of a Chinese background, seem alien and perhaps even outrageous to the extent that they are perceived as being made from professional propagandists. I have no solution for those kind of concerns, and it is up to the moderator team or even Reddit admin to consider how much range of debate this subreddit should have for the complex and international topic that is geopolitics (not only China related topics but all topics in future).

But personally, in my time here I've found this subreddit to overwhelmingly be a place of genuine debate about genuine ideas from genuine people. I do my best to contribute constructively and to use language that is not overly emotive, and I think many people here do so as well. I hope this subreddit can remain so in the future.",PLArealtalk,geopolitics,524,310,1552957730,/r/geopolitics/comments/b2quz3/some_thoughts_on_the_evolving_prochinese_presence/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/b2quz3/some_thoughts_on_the_evolving_prochinese_presence/,china,2025-12-07 13:36:36,"Some thoughts on the evolving pro-Chinese presence in this subreddit [Meta] By now I'm sure quite a few of us have read the Buzzfeed News article about Reddit and this subreddit in particular being a place where discourse has been increasingly ""pro-Chinese"".

* Obviously everyone would agree that things like advocating for violence or genocide or denying the occurrence of historical atrocities would very much be beyond the pale. Similarly, posts including offensive language and personal attacks are also not appropriate for a subreddit with standards.
* But there are obviously many other topics were a range of opinions exist and consensus does not exist. For China related topics (given the focus of this post), this may include interpretations of the Tiananmen protests in 1989, to the legitimacy of the CCP and the Chinese govt, to the nature of the Chinese economy, as well as some more recent heated issues like Chinese re-education efforts in Xinjiang and the social credit system in the country. On the larger scale, topics of debate like the nature of the international legal order, the balance of power of the UN, the fairness of international financial institutions, are various other contentious topics we've seen debated here.
* Individuals of differing backgrounds will have differing opinions about a range of topics. Our opinions and worldviews are a reflection of the way we were socialized by family, friends, media, history and education. To my understanding, I believe this subreddit is open to having opinions from a range of different backgrounds contribute so long as they remain within clear boundaries. I do not believe this subreddit is an ""echo chamber"" that only exclusively pushes a single nation or group's views on all issues. In my opinion this is a good thing, because to have proper discussion about geopolitics one cannot merely only hear what you yourself believe but also what to hear what other groups believe. I myself have learned a lot from a number of users in this subreddit from different backgrounds, including people whose opinions I initially may have disagreed with.
* However, I also appreciate that sometimes merely allowing the debate of certain topics leads to the normalization of certain discourses. Something that was previously seen as completely indefensible may, after some debate, be seen as perhaps not entirely unreasonable under a certain set of circumstances.
* Wherever the moderators choose to set the boundaries either now or in the future, it is an unenviable task.

&#x200B;

**3, Brigading and vote manipulation**

* We all know what brigading and vote manipulation means. I'm not sure if other places have ever coordinated to deliberately manipulate votes or alter contributions or comments here. If so, that is obviously undesirable. I'm not sure how easy it is for the moderators to track this behaviour, but it is somewhat related to the issues of user intent from point 1.
* The infamous case of Unidan also showed us how easy it is for a few alt accounts to alter the vote trajectory of certain comments and to make them obscure. As a matter of principle I do not downvote comments that I disagree with or comments that I am engaged in a debate with. However receiving downvoting due to genuine individuals who disagree with a particular comment also happens, and I imagine it is difficult to distinguish that versus coordinated vote manipulation.
* The votes of a post or comment tend to be perceived as reflecting the amount of support it has. This is inherently tied to whether the contributing upvotes or downvotes to a certain post is a reflection of outside vote manipulation or if it a reflection of the actual demographics of the genuine user base. Hypothetically, if there was a way to determine that the votes of a comment or post are the result of the genuine user base, then the question to be asked is how comfortable the moderator team is in having that proportion of their user base holding those views -- i.e.: tying back to point 2.

=====

Given this subreddit is meant to talk about geopolitics, it is almost impossible to talk about geopolitics without occasionally talking about China related geopolitical events. Naturally there will be debate that follows.

I appreciate that a good portion of this subreddit's userbase likely resides in the western, English speaking world (with a higher proportion from that demographic as part of Reddit's overall userbase). It is likely that many of the arguments made from users of a Chinese background, seem alien and perhaps even outrageous to the extent that they are perceived as being made from professional propagandists. I have no solution for those kind of concerns, and it is up to the moderator team or even Reddit admin to consider how much range of debate this subreddit should have for the complex and international topic that is geopolitics (not only China related topics but all topics in future).

But personally, in my time here I've found this subreddit to overwhelmingly be a place of genuine debate about genuine ideas from genuine people. I do my best to contribute constructively and to use language that is not overly emotive, and I think many people here do so as well. I hope this subreddit can remain so in the future.",2019-03-19 01:08:50,0.0,2019-03

ac32f3,What is the long term vision of the CCP for the Chinese political system?,"What is its 50 or 100 year plan to maintain its viability in the Chinese political system,  in order to maintain that the Mandate of Heaven remains on its hands, and that it maintains its present 70 to 80 percent approval rating in the long run,  given that growth rates in the long term are expected to moderate to 3 to 4 percent at best?

a8luiz,What do you think of Acemoglu and Robinson's argument that Chinese prosperity will reach a plateau due to a lack of progress in developing inclusive economic and political institutions?,"In their book ""Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity and Poverty"", economists Daron Acemoglu and James A Robinson explore the role of institutions in poverty and wealth. Towards the end, they comment on the case of China, where there has been unprecedented economic growth since the 1990s in spite of the Communist Party maintaining large degrees of control over the Chinese economy.

The pair argue that despite making huge strides towards inclusive economic institutions since Deng Xiaoping's reforms, China's economic growth is ""an example of growth under extractive political institutions"". As China's development level catches up to that of western countries, entrepreneurs must be given more room to ply their trade and take advantage of opportunities without being afraid of what the CCP may think. Otherwise the Chinese economy will stagnate and struggle to be competitive.

To put it simply (in their words): ""China has achieved economic growth not thanks to its extractive political institutions, but despite them"". While Deng Xiaoping's reform played a vital role in facilitating this growth, there will come a time in the future when China is faced with the option of political liberalisation or economic stagnation.

I'd be interested to get your thoughts on this matter. To what extent are Chinese leaders willing to tolerate further liberalisation? Is there a balancing act to be played between economic prosperity and security?

9yfn35,IP theft is a common issue in a historical perspective and not just an issue of the Chinese government,"Chinese IP theft isn't an isolated issue, when IP theft is basically done by all capable powers. I remember the time when Japanese companies were known for the activities of copy and stealing IP from the west. Japanese visitors became fake products presented which they made pictures off. Japanese cars in the 1960s and 1970s imitated American design language. Looking even further into history it was Germany before WW1 who copied British products, which made the parliament in London enforcing a **Made in xxx** label on products. The copied products from Germany were cheaper and had at least a comparable quality, which made **Made in Germany** popular. The Netherlands introduced an law for patents as late as in 1912. 

But of course history is developing and the US was accused of stealing IP via CIA and it's stations in NATO countries. At that time it was easy since all communication was done over analog lines or ISDN. [The case Enercon is an good example](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.deutschlandfunk.de%2Fvorsicht-freund-hoert-mit.724.de.html%3Fdram%3Aarticle_id%3D97135&edit-text=&act=url) / [Source](https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/vorsicht-freund-hoert-mit.724.de.html?dram:article_id=97135). But of course it would be quite a lie, when the Germans were painted as innocent. [The German BND spied on Austrian companies for 20 years](https://derstandard.at/2000081647150/Die-Liste-Wen-der-deutsche-Geheimdienst-in-Oesterreich-ausspaehte)

Especially the collaboration of NATO intelligence services to fill gaps of knowledge and circumvent domestic laws was an issue for every domestic industry. The collection of meta data was opening the doors into the local networks. Another attack vector is of course the lack of multiple vendors for operative systems and network technology. Even when Chinese companies like Huawei under a suspicion, Cisco had in the last years so many problems with vulnerabilities and backdoors, that using such a product can be considered as careless. 

We must conclude that IP theft is wide spread and is not just done by China. The accusation of China as the evil is making blind for a solution of such a problem. It's obvious when governments are active supporting IP theft more laws don't help. And the IP theft by non governmental actors like companies is not negligible at all. The protection by laws will not work, when the incentive is that high. Even when a company is getting sanctioned and will declare bankruptcy the knowledge will be sold. Sanctions don't help either when they remove a market for the domestic industry. The development of laws for the protection of IP in various countries was made in most cases when the domestic industry was fully developed and had an advantage on some fields. 

The history about IP protection raises the question to which degree IP protection is outdated, when protection becomes quite expensive. The dream every country has to follow international treaties or will be punished can't be achieved. Companies are often careless, because of the cost of protection. We don't have even a network device certification. It's the reason why China has it's own Linux distribution and China has it's own network device vendors. This is a strategic advantage. The opportunity cost of software is quite a factor which prevents a landscape of competitors offering products focused on security. 

What's left is IMHO just the conclusion a country has to support innovation on all fronts as a long term strategy. Education in school, companies and university are key factors to prevent a decline. The collaboration of government and companies for the education of blue collar workers is extreme important to close the gap between academia and practical experience. Just pushing academics into the companies doesn't work.  The treatment of employees only as a human resource isn't a solution since it doesn't create respect and loyalty. The latter is a factor against IP theft.

9xit1p,Could the US reciprocate Chinese and Russian information warfare? How effectively?,"Obviously there's a fair bit of talk these days about information warfare in the US. Donald Trump's Twitter is full of references to ""fake news"" and Democrats often accuse Russian hackers and troll farms of exercising undue influence on American domestic politics. What the exact effects of information warfare are on the US seem to be anybody's guess, but I think it's fair to say that foreign attempts to spread misinformation and propaganda have probably had some detrimental effect on US national unity and the political beliefs of its citizens.

So, anyways, I'm taking the bus home from work today and I'm wondering - why hasn't the US attempted to wage any similar sort of information warfare against its geopolitical rivals? Or, if it has, why haven't I heard anything about it? I mean, I assume that if Russia can stoke political unrest in the US by employing kids to run Twitter bot farms, the US can do something similar on VK. A quick Google search, however, and the only thing I can find is something called Operation Earnest Voice, which sounds like it's more targeted at Islamic extremists than foreign powers. I know that the US’s main geopolitical rivals – Russia, China, and Iran – are all censoring and various degrees of nondemocratic, but I still imagine that using Internet social media networks to play up corruption scandals or spread fake news about - I dunno - Xi Jinping’s sex life could still do a fair bit to weaken their state apparatuses. And surely the US could find a way to get a message out if it really wanted to.

I guess that even if the US government were able to do something like this, they’d still have to want to do it. First, I’m not sure how the US public would look upon the government screwing around in the domestic politics of foreign powers– it’d obviously be rather hypocritical for the US to be engaging in information warfare right in the wake of the Russia-meddled-in-our-elections accusations. Second, I perceive the US’s main goals with regards to China and Russia (at least) to be more containment than outright destabilization. Still, from a geopolitical perspective at least, it makes sense to me for the US to attempt to weaken its foreign rivals using information warfare, especially when it would probably be pretty cheap to do and when other countries have shown no qualms about using the strategy. 

So I guess I have two questions. First, to what extent is the US engaging in information warfare with foreign powers? Second, if the US were to vigorously engage in an information warfare campaign against its geopolitical rivals, what would the likely results be? Would the US benefit?",C4rlos_D4nger,geopolitics,31,35,1542342083,/r/geopolitics/comments/9xit1p/could_the_us_reciprocate_chinese_and_russian/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/9xit1p/could_the_us_reciprocate_chinese_and_russian/,china,2025-12-07 13:36:36,"Could the US reciprocate Chinese and Russian information warfare?
