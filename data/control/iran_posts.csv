According to this [New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/russias-madman-routine-in-syria-may-have-averted-direct-confrontation-with-the-us-for-now-putin-trump), when the U.S., the UK, and France in April 2018 struck Syrian military sites manned by Russian mercenaries in response to Assad's use of chemical weapons,

>...French military officials had in fact warned their Russian counterparts of the impending strikes. In turn, an official close to the Assad regime told Reuters, “We had an early warning of the strike from the Russians.”

It doesn't seem like the U.S. had huge issues with France's action.

c0gi8b,Why Iran benefits from these attacks,"So yesterday happened and the reaction I've found all across reddit has ranged from disbelief to confusion, so I thought I'd try to share my reasoning as to why I think these attacks benefit Iran the most. Given I believe that all countries involved in this mess are rational and intelligent actors(Except maybe Saudi Arabia on the intelligent  part), this means that if Iran is behind this attack then it was act of genius.


**Background**

Before we get to yesterday's events, it's worth summarizing what brought us here.
As you all know, the US has been imposing increasingly restrictive sanctions on Iran for over a year now, and has managed to dramatically decrease Iranian oil exports and coerce unwilling nations to abide by these sanctions using the threat of secondary sanctions. What's important to note here is that unlike the pre-JCPOA sanctions regime, the international buy-in is less due to desire and more due to coercion. Iran knows this.

As the US added sanction atop sanction, Iran kept threatening to shut down the strait of Hormuz in response, in the logic of ""If we can't sell our oil, neither can the Gulf states!"". The US did not take these threats lightly, which is good given Iran did not make them lightly. The first real attack on oil shipping happened last month, in a method quite similar to this attack. Iran was implicated, the West accused and warned, and we're back to the status quo. This attack however, has more sinister implications because of its timing.


**Timing of the Attack**

What sets apart last month's attacks from this one are two things related to its timing:

1) It comes after a Bolton-issued ultimatum that any attack in the Gulf will be met by a grave response.

2) It comes during a visit by the Japanese PM aimed solely at decreasing tensions.

I want to dwell on the significance of the second point, given I doubt anyone here needs an explanation about why point 1 is relevant. Why is PM Abe in Iran? No, he's not going to mediate to curry brownie-points with Trump, Japan has vital matters of national interest attached to this issue for a large chunk of its oil supply passes through these straits. It's essential that they remain open, and the country sees that this rise of tensions might threaten this supply. 

So as the Japanese PM is in Tehran trying to stave off this nightmare scenario, guess what happens? East Asia bound oil ships get attacked, and this was not lost on Japan as the government immediately stated that these ships had 'Japan-related' cargo on board. Immediately following the attack, Iran moved onto the PR front. Tweets by Khameini directed towards Japan urging it to ignore the US sanctions regime it was forced to buy into, statements by the Iranian government immediately getting ahead of the curve and setting the propaganda narrative, and even a statement saying something to the effect that Iran is the safety guarantor of the strait of Hormuz.

All of this happened and there was still radio silence from Western Capitals, who were either caught unawares or were trying to keep the markets calm or even both. 

**What is the message Iran sent?**

Through this well executed and well timed attack, Iran sent an important message to the coalition of the unwilling:

""The US is not able to guarantee freedom of navigation, and has forced you to buy into a sanctions regime you do not want to buy into and has left you to fend for yourselves as your ships get attacked in response.""

Japan and India, both importers of Iranian oil, were very reluctant about falling into line due to the threats to their oil supplies. Europe is also reluctant given the effects of any conflict would be acutely felt on the continent. And this is just the tip of the iceberg of countries that bought into Iran sanctions by coercion and also by the assumption that the US will protect them from their fears.

Even without all of that, a corner stone of US foreign policy and power is its intent and ability to keep shipping lanes open. In one fell swoop, Iran attacked this principle in a brazen way that obviously took everyone by surprise.

But if the Americans don't act to show the world that they are still guarantors of Free Navigation and that they will protect nations from the negative effects of the sanctions it forced them to buy into, then we will start seeing the unraveling of the sanctions regime sooner rather than later.

This is what the Iranians are hoping to gain from this attack, and this is why the American response in the coming days will be consequential. To me, this is a moment equal in gravity to Obama's Red Line although it might not feel like it now.",EmmanuelBassil,geopolitics,388,377,1560491318,/r/geopolitics/comments/c0gi8b/why_iran_benefits_from_these_attacks/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/c0gi8b/why_iran_benefits_from_these_attacks/,iran,2025-12-08 10:54:42

brs3uv,So have we been underestimating Trump with Iran politics? Like am I crazy to think Trump is at the best position right now?,"So something weird has been happening. Turkey is complying with US sanctions to Iran even tho it had butted heads with US on such issues as the S400. UAE, KSA, Israel have given almost absurd amount of restraint with their anti-Iran sentiment than its usually expected. EU has effective stopped caring anymore with special purpose vehicle. And Fox News and CNN are talking about “Bolton’s war”. And Russia seems weirdly nonchalant about Iran- instead focused more on Venezuela. And China has been cutting its imports from Iran- which is still going on with trade deal with the USA. 

Like it feels like everything is going for Trumps favor right now. If Iran stops compliance with the JCPOA, the world will turn on Iran more so than now and if it does comply with it, US still is crippling its economy and there is no way for it to survive for 10-15 years until sunset clauses expire. Iran doesn’t have a parasitic relationship with any nations like DPRK. 

So right now, Trump is in middle of a trade deal that China that desperately wants, with Huawei ban, and CTO in extradition process and DPRK opening up more than ever. 
Russia is straining itself with Syria, Iran, Venezuela, DPRK, Ukraine, Georgia, but most importantly, Russia does not have the economic power now oil need to help out Iran for its own purpose without cutting itself deep. Russia does benefit from expensive oil of its own when Iran cannot trade its cheaper crude.
Turkey, in middle of almost recession, having f35s blocked and tying for the EU membership and domestic policies like Istanbul win shows Erdogan is not as truly controlling. But, after US leaving Syria (I’m guessing Turkey feels was a gift from US), it would seem too much to then not send the favor to USA back. 

EU has been bit voiceful but the companies still have no opened up to Iran if they may lose US market either. And with Brexit debacle, where UK will probably side with US for a trade deal to heal Brexit, EU will have less tooth then. Especially when Trump keeps bring up NATO 2%. And after China, EU may be the new “new deal” time for Trump. Germany’s Auto sector is already sweating from sanctions with Nord stream 2. 

So if with all this, everything still fails, (Trump has said he doesn’t want war to his officers), it seems Fox News and Trump are ready to blame Bolton as the true mouth piece.

98hrzs,"US & China talking trade, South Korea allegedly asks for an end to the Korean War, and the Department of Iranian Regime Change? - What's your take on the week that was?","Here’s our take on the week that was. We’re acutely conscious that there are many smarter, and more experienced people who frequent this sub, so we’re very keen to hear your takes.

Our three most significant stories this week:

* The US and China are now putting together a process aimed at resolving their trade dispute by November, when Xi and Trump will meet.

* South Korea allegedly asked the United States to consider formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War – in a bid to break a stall in US-North Korea talks.

* The US restructured the State Department, creating a special group focused on Iran – headed up by the former Director of Policy Planning (a very senior role). Pompeo said this is about changing Iranian behaviour, while experts said this is about changing the Iranian regime. 

Our three most thought-provoking articles of the week:

* Richard Haas, himself a former Director of Policy Planning, argued that without the glue of the Soviet threat, the US-Turkey relationship is destined to deteriorate.

* Rebecca Collard of Time Magazine gave a good overview of the stakes in Idlib, Syria – a city awaiting its fate as Assad’s tanks roll into position for a potential advance.

*  David Fickling of Bloomberg asked big questions of the fundamental economics of many of China’s Belt and Road projects, and argued that there are “echoes” of Soviet era collapse in Beijing’s misdirected spending. 

Three events to watch in the coming week:

* Whether the US and Turkey can patch over some of their many differences, after Turkey’s Foreign Minister said, “we are ready to talk about everything” so long as there’s “no threatening, no dictating”.

* Whether agreement on process can translate to agreement on sticky substantive issues at the US-China trade talks on 22 & 23 August.

* Whether US National Security Advisor John Bolton can make modest progress with Russia on arms control, at the follow up to the Trump-Putin summit.

A a full set of links to the referenced stories is available on our [site] (https://www.ambassadorsbrief.com/posts/NW8S5L7iTiwKrTMPk) 

Hopefully that's enough to kick off a bit of discussion. - We're especially interested in hearing your predictions for the events in the coming week, and what to make of the ""Iran Action Group""",ambassadorsbrief,geopolitics,18,1,1534653179,/r/geopolitics/comments/98hrzs/us_china_talking_trade_south_korea_allegedly_asks/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/98hrzs/us_china_talking_trade_south_korea_allegedly_asks/,iran,2025-12-08 10:54:42

8jds8j,Iranian deal - Panel debate For & Apposing (1hour soundcloud),"I listened to the debate hosted by Intelligence Squared on the Iranian deal. The panel For the deal urges those opposing it to provide an credible alternative for the deal.  I am still processing the arguments of both sides. I am against the Nuclear deal because the moment it happened the newspapers argued that the motion will make the world unsafe as the Iranian government will retaliate. \(so you must be afraid then\)

Soon after the statement of the newspapers, we saw on the morning hours of 10th May that Iranian units fired missiles into Israel \(according to IDF reports\) and we saw the American flag being burned inside the Iranian government. This, for me, translates that if Iran can retaliate in such matters, then imagine what they can do if something goes wrong according to their narrative once they have nuclear capabilities. 

After listening to the panels, what is your feeling on the Iranian question?

7j6dha,"Iranian media discussing way forward after victories in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen etc.","Published this week in the Iranian newspaper *Javan*
---

""Samuel Huntington's strategic points of view and his predictions [i.e. Clash of Civilizations] are not forgotten. He said: 'After the USSR, there are eight civilizations. Of them, only the Islamic and Chinese cultures will clash [with the West] in the future, and this will be violent and bloody.'

""Now, 30 years after Huntington said this, the world is seeing the deterioration of the West's might, and the shaping of the great civilization of Islam:

""1. America is $17 trillion in debt, and in effect is economically bankrupt.

""2. The world is witnessing the shaping of a multipolar regime with an Asiatic approach, in which Iran is a major axis.

""3. Iran has become the No. 1 power in the region, and it is very influential.

""4. The peoples of the world hate the behavior of the West in general, and particularly of America; this hatred is increasing by the day.

""5. The internal problems in America and in Europe are increasing, and this facilitates conditions for the emergence of new powers.

""6. The Western media empire is collapsing; the administration of the media is changing rapidly, and is no longer exclusively in the hands of the West.

""7. Iran is situated in the best spot in the [Asian] continent, and is unquestionably superior in the world with regard to oil and energy.

""8. Iran has the material and spiritual might and capability to export its revolution to the world.

""9. The Saudi regime that controls the Hijaz has suffered defeat in all its schemes to expand, and all its threats and efforts against Iran have become opportunities for Iran.

""10. The West, particularly America, cannot meet the needs of their people, because of the weakness of the liberal-capitalist [ideology], and have become helpless in the face of the Wall Street movement [sic].

""Therefore, our strong points must be matched with the weak points of the enemies, and our diplomacy must be adjusted in accordance with the long-term goals of the revolution.

""We must prepare ourselves to build a new world order. We need to build the new world order, and not to wait for others to shape the future according to their doctrine and their goals.

71y2bh,Thoughts on an Iranian land bridge?,"I was just wondering if folks had any thoughts on a possible extension of Iranian influence to the Mediterranean and what this possible extension’s effect would be on the security of the United States.

As ISIS fades, it seems like there may be a conflict along the Euphrates River. Most of western Syria seems to be back under the control of the Syrian government and some supporting militias, who are said to be backed by Iran. These forces seem to be moving north-east. But the north-east of Syria seems to be under the control of the SDF and U.S. special forces. Some of Eastern and southern Syria still seem to be controlled by anti-Assad forces as well.

According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-army/syrian-army-sends-more-troops-across-euphrates-close-to-u-s-backed-forces-idUSKCN1BT2B9):

 > A commander in a militia of the U.S.-backed SDF confirmed Syrian army units had crossed [to the eastern side of the Euphrates] and said his fighters were ready to drive them back.

I’ve seen some arguments that say that if the Syrian government takes back control of north-east Syria, and because Iran seems to support Shia militias in Shia majority Iraq, then Iran will have a “land bridge” through Iraq to Lebanon. I’ve also seen some arguments that say that the U.S. should launch another war against the Syrian government, these militias, and Russian special forces to defend Syria’s eastern border.

I'm under the impression that Syria has been an Iranian ally for some time, if I’m not mistaken. After the invasion of Iraq and before the Syrian Civil War, Iran reportedly began supporting Shia militias in Iraq. So it seems that Iran essentially had a land bridge during that time period. And despite having friendly governments in Syria and Lebanon, this Iranian influence did not seem to have a corrosive effect on the region. It did not seem to have an effect on American security either.

I’m wondering if, once ISIS is defeated, the US should war with the Syrian government, these militias, and Russian special forces to maintain control of Syria’s eastern border. How does that help American safety?

6c2k1e,Are there good comprehensive sources on the Iranian presidential election and its consequences for regional politics?,"This may be a better question to ask after the results are out. However answers prior to these may lack the bias of the winning party and thus interest me just as much. So please bear with me.  
Should the title question be too broad to get a discussion going some a bit more pointed questions:

What internal groups are influental/important in the election and what are their goals?  
What external actors have a sway in the elections, likewise why would they steer Iran towards what?

Is the current Iran internally stable and unified? Is there a trend moving these values? 


From a neutral perspective, within the next few (~5) years what are achievable geopolitical goals? With whose interests would they conflict?

Given Iran acts as much a rational actor as one can be in which way would the regional power shift within the next few years? Depending on the winner of the election how would this rationale sway?

8xajg7,What was Trump's rationale for withdrawing from JCPOA just before meeting Kim-Jong Un?,"I've heard people say the move only undermined trust in America's word at precisely the worst possible moment. But given the timing, was it not more likely a deliberate signal to NK that they had better be prepared to make the concessions necessary to convince Congress?

The worst possible outcome for the US would be a half-measure or incrementally implemented deal that relieves pressure on NK only for NK to renege and rebound in an even more powerful position in future. On the other hand, it would be difficult to demand to NK's faces, after their charm offensive and gestures of good faith, that they should give up everything before receiving anything.

Could it be that withdrawing from the JCPOA was intended to resolve this dilemma? When negotiating with NK, the Trump administration can now point to the failure of JCPOA as justification for pursuing nothing less than a treaty with Congress, and then to the inflexibility of Congress as justification for making heavy demands before giving any concessions.

The Trump administration can now credibly exhibit good faith and trust in NK's intentions by pointing to Congress as an unshakable reality/constraint both parties have to work under -- a kind of good-cop bad-cop situation.

Ultimately the JCPOA may have eliminated a middle-ground that was considered dangerous from the American perspective, but would have been difficult to avoid by persuasion/positive negotiation.

Any thoughts?

8iscrx,I'm trying to understand the Iran Nuclear Deal and I have some questions,"This past week was finals week for me, but nonetheless I did some reading on the Iran Deal when I had the free time. I knew family and friends would be talking about it more, so knowing that I wanted to read some information on it so I could have more of an informed opinion. 

The Deal itself seems straightforward - cutting Iran's nuclear resources/supply, and lifting sanctions placed by Western countries as an incentive for Iran to abide by the Deal.  Checks and balances were put in place as another means to prevent Iran from cheating. Intricate details aside... in my (perhaps) limited understanding, I feel like the Deal makes sense. 

However, there are aspects relating to the deal that are not so clear to me. My questions are:

1) One of Trump's claims was that Iran is not adhering to the spirit of the deal by continuing to work on ballistic missiles and engage in sparse military actions in the Middle East. What is ""the spirit of the deal""? Did all countries involved agree to ""the spirit of the deal""?

2) Is there a way to measure adherence to ""the spirit of the deal""?

3) I have read claims here and there that this Deal ""is a death sentence for Israel"" and that it ""paves the way for Iran to develop nuclear weapons"". After reading through the Deal, those claims dont make much sense to me - can anyone address the validity of those claims?",pump_dragon,geopolitics,67,35,1526083228,/r/geopolitics/comments/8iscrx/im_trying_to_understand_the_iran_nuclear_deal_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/8iscrx/im_trying_to_understand_the_iran_nuclear_deal_and/,iran,2025-12-08 10:54:42

6oaqi1,Is Iran violating the nuclear deal? When do violations matter?,"Edit: I see people couldn't help but immediately downvote.

Bear with me, since I know this is unpopular (and may get downvoted to hell anyways). I've been seeing more and more people claiming lately that Iran, despite having been certified as complying with the Iran deal, has not actually been compliant. Certification is no guarantee, after all, since sometimes minor transgressions get overlooked in favor of certification of these types of things to preserve ties or because the costs of decertification are outweighed by the benefits of certification.

But I think it's worth looking into whether the Iran deal has been violated by Iran, since it helps understand the baseline at which countries may take action to decertify Iranian compliance, and can give us a sort of sneak peek into potential crises down the line.

So as I said, I started looking into claims of Iranian violations. The claims I've found are outlined by Republican Senators, who say that Iran has:

* Exceeded heavy water limits

* Exceeded limits on advanced centrifuges, and plans to expand the numbers even further

* Attempted to circumvent restrictions on acquisition of technology barred without UN Security Council approval

* Refusal to grant physical access to IAEA inspectors to Iranian facilities

So how credible are these accusations, and what is the context behind each?

The accusation about heavy water is easiest to investigate. Basically, [Iran has twice](https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-iran-exceeds-limits-heavy-water/3589850.html) exceeded the 130-ton limit on heavy water. Once, they had 130.1 tons, and the other time, it was 130.9. This is not all that concerning, and Iran dipped below the limit not long after. What *is* concerning is that heavy water, which can be used to create plutonium, is [being shipped out by Iran](http://www.dw.com/en/un-watchdog-iran-shipped-excess-heavy-water-to-comply-with-nuclear-deal/a-36671462), reportedly to Oman. While this doesn't violate the deal technically, it's a sizable and interesting loophole in the deal's text. So this matter doesn't seem dangerous, unless and until Iran starts bringing back heavy water it is storing elsewhere.

The second accusation, about nuclear centrifuges, is inherently difficult to verify. David Albright, head of the Institute for Science and International Security (unfortunately acronym'ed ISIS, since before ISIS was a thing), [testified to the US House of Representatives](http://isis-online.org/conferences/detail/house-subcommittee-testimony-of-david-albright-on-assessing-iran-nuclear-de/) on all of the alleged JCPOA violations. When he got to mention of the centrifuges, he noted another deal ambiguity. The deal allows for ""roughly 10"" IR-6 advanced centrifuges to be operated, but Iran is operating 15. This is based on the text of the secret Iran plan leaked to the Associated Press that goes along with the JCPOA, and is part of it. So Iran appears to have a violation here, if not a significant loophole yet again, but not a huge one at the moment.

The third issue is acquisition of technology. This is much more straightforward, and German intelligence has confirmed that Iran sought and seeks to procure dual-use materials that are barred to it under the JCPOA without UNSC approval. The deal states clearly that without UN Security Council approval, no state can transfer certain technology related to missile and nuclear technology to Iran, but Iran has sought to go outside of this channel and import illegally. Note: I am **not** calling missile tests a violation. Please don't bring up this straw man. But this is a pretty clear violation, though no one seems willing to act on it as of yet.

And finally fourth, the thing I found most interesting, is the report on claims that Iran is barring access to its nuclear sites by IAEA inspectors. Albright mentions this, saying that military sites are off-limits to IAEA personnel, which is a violation of the JCPOA. There is a dispute resolution mechanism for this, but it seems that the US and other states have not wanted to trigger it, again showing a cost-benefit analysis here, but a future point of serious contention. However, I've also noticed that the Sharif University visit is something that Albright reported on, not something the IAEA mentioned wanting to do. It's strange that I have found no mention of this proposed visit to a site, which means Albright may simply have incorrect information. However, there is also a curious lack of information regarding the Parchin site. IAEA inspectors [found uranium at Parchin](https://www.wsj.com/articles/uranium-provides-new-clue-on-irans-past-nuclear-arms-work-1466380760), which the Iranians insisted never housed any nuclear work, but there has been no follow-up visit to the site to ascertain the origin of the uranium samples, which the IAEA said was uncertain. That's also rather unusual, so it seems possible that the IAEA is not publishing full results of its requests to visit Iranian sites, and may be sharing them secretly with states who are involved in JCPOA compliance.

The significant friction points that remain, in my view, are the possibility of a clash over IAEA inspectors in the future, as well as the possibility of clashing over Iranian centrifuges. However, as many have noted, Iran's commitment to the heavy water limits has strengthened, and they went comfortably below the limit by the next report, likely in an attempt to avoid scrutiny by the new administration while waiting to see what the orange guy's ""tougher approach"" to compliance would be.

At what point, though, will this lead to friction? Is it possible that Trump is so preoccupied with whatever it is he's looking at that he'll give Iran more leeway? And will Europe respond if another German report comes out saying Iran is trying to circumvent restrictions on technology imposed by the deal, or will it just wait until Iran seeks a nuclear weapon, at which point it may be too late?",tayaravaknin,geopolitics,7,41,1500491423,/r/geopolitics/comments/6oaqi1/is_iran_violating_the_nuclear_deal_when_do/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/6oaqi1/is_iran_violating_the_nuclear_deal_when_do/,iran,2025-12-08 10:54:42

6then6,Is a nuclear armed Iran inevitable?,"I'm curious what /r/geopolitics thinks about this. I am by no means an expert of Geopolitics, nor do I pretend to be. However I was doing some research about the Iranian nuclear deal and I understand that it has a time frame. Rex Tillerson said that the Iran Nuclear deal is a failure, equating it with the same approach that the US had to North Korea (that obviously hasn't worked) and that the JCPOA ""fails to achieve the objective of a non-nuclear Iran."" Source: https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2017/4/20/us-could-revise-failed-iran-nuclear-deal

So is it a matter of time that Iran gets a nuclear weapon? That the nuclear deal is just a mere stopgap for the inevitable that is a nuclear armed Iran? 

Also, perhaps unrelated to the question, how feasible is it that Iran (if it wishes to) buys nuclear weapons/material from North Korea? From North Korea's POV, it would be a good move against the US.

boix7a,"Tensions Escalate Between the US and Iran, Iran Responds to US Sanctions – Is There Hope for Diplomacy?","2019 has been a tough year for the Iranians, following the US exit of the nuclear program agreement and the JCPOA sanctions over Iran. Now, Iran takes a new strategy versus the US which includes three types of fronts: The nuclear program, military action, and the export of oil. 

Eventually, the United States and Iran realize that the best solution for them is diplomacy and even Donald Trump, the one who started this minor conflict now asks to get a phone call from the Iranians.

92eue1,Which countries/companies do you think will comply with the American sanctions against Iran?,"Before the U.S ceased its participation from the JCPOA, multiple companies and individuals tried to get around the sanctions and they received a strong reaction from the U.S. I remember that multiple European Banks paid fines, Chinese mobile giant ZTE ended up paying a $1 billion fine.

As far as I know no country openly traded with sanctioned Iranian enterprises, because lots of foreign governments own American bonds. That said, I wouldn't be surprised if Cuban or Venezuelan governments did.

The sanctions are more complicated than "" Are you trading with Iran? If so, now pay fines"". Companies/Banks doing business with companies that trading with Iran also suffer from the consequences, its very difficult to get around this. For example: Turkish-Iranian businessman Reza Zarrab tried to launder money from his trade with Iran in Turkey, and now he is in an American prison with the banker helped him in money laundering.

Lets say that a country created an isolated company that only trades with Iran and decided not to spend or invest its revenue on anything or on very specific goods. Theoretically its possible, Europeans were discussing a similar plan. Its not financially wise not to do anything with your money, could this be a reasonable gamble if you are hoping embargo to be lifted in near future?  As far as I know, the laws don't work like that(one would argue the defendant has a right to benefit from changes in laws when its in his favor),  otherwise ZTE's fine would be lifted when the JCPOA was signed. If there is truly a way to get around this, who can guarantee the U.S won't find other ways to retaliate?

Personally, I only expect companies from countries already under American sanctions and the companies from countries with a small trade volume with the U.S not to comply with the sanctions. Iranian main export is gas and it could be bought from anyone, but for some countries exporting goods to Iran would be profitable. Potentially companies from especially Russia where part of finance sector is already under American sanctions and Turkey, a country doesn't export much to the U.S and would profit from ignoring the sanctions, may go for it. I naturally expect countries like Venezuela and Cuba to fully ignore it.

8huw5h,What war would be the most likely result of US sanctioning Iran?,"Assume that Trump decides to sabotage the Iran nuclear deal, imposing sanctions on Iran, asking for further concessions on the deal, or accusing Iran of being not in compliance.

This move is sure to ratchet up tensions across the Near and Middle East, further escalating Iran - Saudi rivalry and, as is often mumbled, may well lead to war.

But which war? US or Israeli strikes on nuclear sites in Iran? A replay of Syria in another country, like Yemen? Something in and around Palestine?

What are the odds?

87qr8k,Were Iran sanctions effective? Or did they make the country stronger in the long run?,"First, Iran was forced to diversefy their industry and couldn't rely solely on oil. Second the sanctions worked somewhat like tarrifs as they protected the home market. We can see this from the recent protests where the goverment is trying to impose rules that would be more in line with the market situation before the sanctions. On the other hand the ""protected"" domestic  market growth since the sanctions years makes Iran a powerfull force in the regional markets.  
What is your take on this issue?
