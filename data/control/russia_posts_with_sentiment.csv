c4rjeg,"Why is the US more concerned about a Middle East hegemon and WMDs than Europe, Russia and China?","Why is the US more concerned about a Middle East hegemon and WMDs than Europe, Russia and China?

&#x200B;

Throughout the Cold War the US has relied on the Middle East for secure oil supplies in case of a war with the Soviet Union. The US feared the Soviets or another Middle East power such as Nasser's Arab Republic taking over and the US could no longer effectively fuel their tanks and aircraft in an arms race. The US allied with Saudi Arabia, a rather non-nationalistic, non-populist state, that would provide them oil, and the US would provide them security. US also allied with Israel by the time of the 1970s, since Israel was an effective buffer against Arab states and provided intelligence on both regional threats and terrorists.

Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the conventional large scale military threat was gone. However on 9/11, the US got a taste that history was not over and the new century has come. The US feared that terrorists would take control of Saudi Arabia and other Arab states and also feared they would get WMDs, ie. the invasion if Iraq and Afghanistan.

However, by the time of 2014, the shale revolution had begun and the US no longer relied on oil from the Middle East. China and Europe still relied on the Middle East for oil supplies. However, it seems like the US is still the most involved in the Middle East, why is this? Also the US is really concerned about WMDs still, why is this?

The theory if Iran did control the Middle East, a Russian-Iran block will be formed. Also Europe could get its oil supplies from Africa and China from Russia. US propting up Saudi Arabia is a good way to keep China and Europe in check in theory.

The first theory makes more sense. Historically, the US has always represented the anti-nationalist pro-globalization force, while Russia has been a the nationalist force, the US being very capital rich and suited for global trade while the colder more isolated Russia has been less open. US props up capital rich proxies while Russia props up nationalist ones. Saudi Arabia is an unstable state by design and it is very reliant on the United States for trade and security. A nationalist state in the Middle East like Iran would always back a state like Russia. Russia would provide Iran with weapons and security while Iran would join Russia's sphere of influence. China would have no choice but to side with the this new Eurasian alliance, them being a vital trading partner and a supplier of oil.",Mrbsct,geopolitics,24,31,1561395983,/r/geopolitics/comments/c4rjeg/why_is_the_us_more_concerned_about_a_middle_east/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/c4rjeg/why_is_the_us_more_concerned_about_a_middle_east/,russia,2025-12-07 13:35:45,"Why is the US more concerned about a Middle East hegemon and WMDs than Europe, Russia and China?

bi4os2,How was Russia able to annex Crimean but the UAE failed to take Socotra?,"My question is weird but it's something I don't understand and I wanted to see if someone could explain it.

In 2014, Russia occupied Crimea and then annexed it after having a referendum showing that the people wanted it. There was condemnation but Russia braved the storm and today in 2019, Crimea is a part of Russia. Although Ukraine still disputes the loss.

The UAE tried the same with the Yemeni island of Socotra in 2018, it occupied the entire island with its own soldiers (not Yemeni militiamen or mercenaries) and began handing the residents privileges like work permits to go to the UAE. When the world condemned it, the UAE backed down immediately and withdrew even going so far as to hand over half the island to Saudi Arabia and promise not to annex it.

Why didn't the UAE just copy Russia and have some sort of referendum where 87% of the Socotrans voted in favor of joining the UAE? It's an oil-rich country, I'm certain most of them would have loved the idea.

bhwtfm,The US does not spend much more than Russia and China on military-once you factor in Purchasing Power Parity(PPP)," There is this constant saying that the US ""spends the most on miltitary and you can combine the world's budget and it wouldn't equal the US"". However this is skewed because if you are looking at exchange ratios for USDs and not looking at purchasing power parity, the US does seem like this. However once you take in PPP, the US should not be much more powerful than lets say Russia and China combined. US spends also a lot on giving soldiers welfare, healthcare and paying their soldiers as a decent career.

&#x200B;

Here is the charts. $606 Billion for the US vs China's $434 in terms of PPP equivlancy. This is simply due to the fact in PPP terms, the US economy is smaller than China. You can probably buy a fighter jet in China much cheaper with less US dollars, similar how a American buys beer cheaper when going to Mexico. US does spend more on carrier and air forces, while China focuses more on land forces, so US does have the ability to hop around more around the world, and has more world bases. In terms of percentage of GDP, the US is not overwhelming to any degree and Russia spends a higher percentage.

SS: The Trump presidency has begun the first administrative steps towards new arms control treaties with both Russia and China. 

Despite the article's title, the new arms control treaty envisioned does not intend to cover only nuclear weapons, but are likely aimed to bring new classes of weapon systems under purview as well.

President Trump has formed a reputation for breaking and making economic and political treaties with countries it has close ties or interests in the two years of his presidency. He personally cites the ""hundreds of billions of dollars spent on weapons"" as a reason for arms control, and ""should include all the weapons, all the warheads, all the missiles"".

Arms control treaties are typically the most difficult kind of deal to make though, since the speed of a deal depends on how much leverage one side has over another, and since the arms are the leverage itself,  no one makes arms control treaties with unequal sides.

bwoew8,"Possibilities of Russian invasion on Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova","Peter Zeihan once predicted the war between Russia and Europe in his book *The Absent Superpower*. After the collapse of USSR, Russia has been suffered from demographic crisis(population decline) and harsher geography for defense (borderline is closer to capital Moscow and the length of borderline is much longer). In order to get rid of strategical inferiority, Russian would try to retake some ex-USSR countries back and make Russian demographics and borderline more decent and stable. Military interventions in Crimea and Donbass region are just one of the first phase strategic actions, regaining its influence on East Europe. The next would be invading and annexing these ex-communist countries. According to him, Russia should hurry up before Russian military became too small to take military actions at least decently from youth population decline. The below is the summary of his proposed Russian strategy.

Of course, his overall thought has gone too far. He even suggested the war between Russia and some NATO states(3 Baltic States, part of Poland and Romania)/Caucasus region.

Getting involved in Caucasus would be also disastrous, considering Russian history that getting entangled in just Chechen region for a long time. However, if Russia ends its expansion on invading and annexing non-NATO and non-Caucasian states such as Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, the overall strategy might be a little bit rational for Russia.

bsymk5,The Russian military doesn't need to conquer Europe-Its energy market has already," All this talk from geopolticial forcasters that Russians is a ""cornered snake"" and that do to the slow economy, population decline,  and lagging tech base, that it is best time to invade Europe. However, I don't think this is even needed for Russia's geopolitical interests: ie security on the North European plain, the security more arable land, and security of more warm water ports. 

 Almost all of Eastern Europe relies on Russian energy ie. Russian oil and gas. Germany is very reliant on Russian gas and Nordstream 2 bypasses the need for maintence in Ukraine. So so these Eastern European nations may hate Russia, but when push comes to shove, it is not like they will do anything about it. That means a increasingly Russian leaning political leaning. Hell Russia may be even to lease a port in the future.

The security risk from the US military is effectively nullified. First off, the US has no reason to invade Russia, and I think Putin knows this. The US military has no interests in Europe other than the command base against the Middle East and the security of its markets(which are declining) Increasingly, Russia has the capability to sanction anyone who support abrubt US actions. Unless Russia blantantly attacks triggering Article 5, Russia is fairly secure. 

  
Second of all, Russia will have a tough time take Europe. Russia is not the Soviet Union with top tier tanks and fighter planes. Germany and France are major players in the EU and will not see their assets invaded in Eastern Europe and use their forces to defend. The Soviets had a population of 300 million now Russia only has a population of around 100 million. Not a lot of infantry to recruit compared to a massive EU. How about tanks. Their latest tank the Armata simply can't be mass produced, and most of their tanks are upgraded Cold War T-72s. How about fighters? Many of the EU will buying the American F-35 the next generation stealth fighter, and China is countering their J-20. Russia is failing to produce their next generation stealth fighter. Navy? EU has 3 carriers, and 2 being built, while the Russian one almost sunk. Submarines, the EU ones are far more advanced. Furthermore the Eastern Europeans, even if war breaks out, it is not like they buy LNG.

al9xim,The case for Russian engagement in the Korean peninsula,"The case for Russian engagement in the Korean peninsula

Submission Statement:

Russia is today a ""former"" great power trying to restore its past glory. Yet, they are hindered by demographic, economic and political difficulties which are hard to overcome. They are aging fast, they are dying fast and they have enemies everywhere. Some western analysts are saying that China and Russia are getting closer than ever, and that it is a big threat which needs to be addressed. They are correct to a certain degree. But they need to realize that Russia is actually more afraid of China than Europe or the USA. They share a massive land-border and if Russia fails to modernize its economy, they will become essentially a vassal state to China. The recent Sino-Russian alignment is nothing but the result of immediate concerns and has no solid foundation. The real big player and threat is China. Therefore, I would like to argue that Russia must be lured to our side by providing her with tangible benefits, and Korea could play a key role in making that happen. 

First, it is necessary to note that the ""Korean Question"" is one of the most crucial flashpoints in East Asia. North Korea must be restrained but they won't unless they get something in return. However, last year has been a phase of great pacification by giving momentum to diplomacy and negotiations. Now, the US and North Korea are vying for some kind of compromise. In the process, South Korea has repeatedly advocated for a Russian engagement. We have made explicit our plans for railroads and pipelines. So, what does this mean?

South Korea is the second largest importer of natural gas in the world. Russia needs to diversify its customer base. They are almost entirely relying on Western Europe and their relations are sour at best. South Korea can provide cash for oil/gas and we can invest in Russia to build factories and create jobs. On the other hand, Korea can make its industry more competitive by lowering energy costs and therefore generating more wealth for the country. Should South Korea become richer and stronger, we could afford to pay more for US forces and we could buy more US weapons.

South Korea can serve as a gateway for Russia for foreign markets too. Russia's Far East will have more jobs and more factories, more goods. We will bring them via railway to our markets and we can re-export them to the outer world. 

If Russia gets a regular continous and reliable source of income by establishing closer connection with South Korea, by having North Korea as a road, then Russia will have more than enough incentives to restrain North Korea's behavior. Russia has a land-border with North Korea, and Russia has the willpower to engage militarily if a third-rate power crosses in their path. 

A Russo-Korean (South) cooperation with the benediction of the US will serve as a good encircling web against China. It will enrich South Korea, it will enrich (to a certain degree) Russia and reduce their dependency of China, it will restrain North Korea by making them content to have a rent revenue.

Submission Statement:

Russia is today a ""former"" great power trying to restore its past glory. Yet, they are hindered by demographic, economic and political difficulties which are hard to overcome. They are aging fast, they are dying fast and they have enemies everywhere. Some western analysts are saying that China and Russia are getting closer than ever, and that it is a big threat which needs to be addressed. They are correct to a certain degree. But they need to realize that Russia is actually more afraid of China than Europe or the USA. They share a massive land-border and if Russia fails to modernize its economy, they will become essentially a vassal state to China. The recent Sino-Russian alignment is nothing but the result of immediate concerns and has no solid foundation. The real big player and threat is China. Therefore, I would like to argue that Russia must be lured to our side by providing her with tangible benefits, and Korea could play a key role in making that happen. 

First, it is necessary to note that the ""Korean Question"" is one of the most crucial flashpoints in East Asia. North Korea must be restrained but they won't unless they get something in return. However, last year has been a phase of great pacification by giving momentum to diplomacy and negotiations. Now, the US and North Korea are vying for some kind of compromise. In the process, South Korea has repeatedly advocated for a Russian engagement. We have made explicit our plans for railroads and pipelines. So, what does this mean?

South Korea is the second largest importer of natural gas in the world. Russia needs to diversify its customer base. They are almost entirely relying on Western Europe and their relations are sour at best. South Korea can provide cash for oil/gas and we can invest in Russia to build factories and create jobs. On the other hand, Korea can make its industry more competitive by lowering energy costs and therefore generating more wealth for the country. Should South Korea become richer and stronger, we could afford to pay more for US forces and we could buy more US weapons.

South Korea can serve as a gateway for Russia for foreign markets too. Russia's Far East will have more jobs and more factories, more goods. We will bring them via railway to our markets and we can re-export them to the outer world. 

If Russia gets a regular continous and reliable source of income by establishing closer connection with South Korea, by having North Korea as a road, then Russia will have more than enough incentives to restrain North Korea's behavior. Russia has a land-border with North Korea, and Russia has the willpower to engage militarily if a third-rate power crosses in their path. 

A Russo-Korean (South) cooperation with the benediction of the US will serve as a good encircling web against China. It will enrich South Korea, it will enrich (to a certain degree) Russia and reduce their dependency of China, it will restrain North Korea by making them content to have a rent revenue. All the parties involved would be satisfied and reduce the risks of armed conflict. Therefore, I'd argue that South Korea needs a new Nordpolitik focusing on Russia, and that the US/EU should seek a rapprochement with Russia to counterbalance the immense threat that China poses to the whole world.

aj4642,Question: Russian Air Base in Venezuela logic and update?,"I can't quite remember where Venezuela's main refining/export site for their oil sits. However, I only recently heard Russia has announced intentions to build a military installation on the island of La Orchila just north of the mainland.

agvfby,Russian expansion in the Arctic,"Will the Russian Arctic become the next major global natural resource area? 

Having read many articles related to the Russian-Arctic issue, which (as for me) have lately been appearing in the Media more and more often, I’ve realized that the question is on everyone’s mind… if not of everyone’s concern. 

Maybe, there are actual grounds. Let’s see. 

Take for example the *Northern Latitudinal Railway*, a Russian governmental railroad project. Its construction will be completed by 2023 and is going to free capacity on Trans-Siberian route and connect the Yamal Peninsula to the Russian rail network. 

Another project, based on a latitudinal approach is the so-called *Belkomur,* a railroad that is aimed at direct connection of such regions as Siberia and Ural with the Northwest of Russia. And what is more, it is highly likely that China’s railway will also be connected to this project in time. That actually causes my concern too, because the linkage of such powerful countries would pose significant economic challenges for Europe and the USA in terms of winning natural resources in the Arctic. 

The concerns seem to be confirmed even by the U.S. Navy that is **planning to expand its role in the Arctic**, naming Russia and China “great-power rivals for influence in the far north”. 

And I keep thinking whether we can address this “Arctic challenge”, given China’s financial superiority and Russia’s territorial one.

a63ocm,Why is the Russian Economy so weak?,"Hey guys, 

I'd like to have a discussion on this topic, given the popular consensus that Russia is on a slow decline and unable to compete as a world power due to its weak economy. It seems bizarre, given how powerful the USSR was at its peak; I have even seen some posters here cast doubt on whether the Russian Federation will maintain statehood within the next half century. This topic certainly bears further investigation as it will inform Russia's relations with other powers and how it selects its alignments. 

I will start off with some of my thoughts, and encourage others to critique, add to them and/or use them as a base for injecting additional insight. 

Firstly, I suspect that the chaos that followed the fall of the USSR laid the seeds for dysfunction. To what extent, and in what manner, I would seek clarification on. Did Western exploitation wreak deep wounds that are still felt today, or are the damages from that time largely past? 

I realize that some large part of Russia's economic troubles have to do with an oligarchy of resource barons who stymie any real forays into diversifying the economy or moving away from resource exportation, but surely, given Russia's immense territory, it's utter lack of proportional heft is baffling. Given the expanding trade relations between Russia and the PRC, do you think the relationship will remain resource heavy? It does not seem like a sustainable approach to me and Russia could do better. 

This large expanse of territory does come with its curse of course. The logistical nightmare involved in keeping the country togethe is quite unenviable. Aging infrastructure needs to be maintained, extensive military hardware has to be kept up to date, all to the backdrop of harsh climatic conditions which exacerbate upkeep costs. Russia's only warm water port in Vladivostok still sees significant downtime due to inclement weather, and is located on an extreme of the country. How debilitating is this for trade aspirations beyond Eurasia? Namely the Americas, SEA, and Africa? 

While it's population isn't huge, it's still very respectable, notwithstanding the challenges of advancing median age; I postulate that shortened life expectancy may play some part in reduced economic capacity. Some other posters here have mentioned the crippling loss in military age citizens that awaits in a few decades, but how will this in turn affect economic activity given that many developed nations are also facing a similar challenge? Will automation start to become a way for states with lower populations to level the playing field? 

Corruption and criminal activity (Intl Rus Mafia) 
How significantly do these two hemorrhage the economy? Do you see any meaningful action taken to curb the two, and what would it look like? 

Foreign adventurism
This is a clear avenue from which Russia is draining its coffers. It must do so to exert itself in one of the only ways it still can on the international stage, and to protect its interests, but how long can these costly exertions be sustained? Food for thought. 
Research competitiveness

Foreign investment attractiveness/ease of doing business/international sanctions

I'd like to have a discussion on this topic, given the popular consensus that Russia is on a slow decline and unable to compete as a world power due to its weak economy. It seems bizarre, given how powerful the USSR was at its peak; I have even seen some posters here cast doubt on whether the Russian Federation will maintain statehood within the next half century. This topic certainly bears further investigation as it will inform Russia's relations with other powers and how it selects its alignments. 

I will start off with some of my thoughts, and encourage others to critique, add to them and/or use them as a base for injecting additional insight. 

Firstly, I suspect that the chaos that followed the fall of the USSR laid the seeds for dysfunction. To what extent, and in what manner, I would seek clarification on. Did Western exploitation wreak deep wounds that are still felt today, or are the damages from that time largely past? 

I realize that some large part of Russia's economic troubles have to do with an oligarchy of resource barons who stymie any real forays into diversifying the economy or moving away from resource exportation, but surely, given Russia's immense territory, it's utter lack of proportional heft is baffling. Given the expanding trade relations between Russia and the PRC, do you think the relationship will remain resource heavy? It does not seem like a sustainable approach to me and Russia could do better. 

This large expanse of territory does come with its curse of course. The logistical nightmare involved in keeping the country togethe is quite unenviable. Aging infrastructure needs to be maintained, extensive military hardware has to be kept up to date, all to the backdrop of harsh climatic conditions which exacerbate upkeep costs. Russia's only warm water port in Vladivostok still sees significant downtime due to inclement weather, and is located on an extreme of the country. How debilitating is this for trade aspirations beyond Eurasia? Namely the Americas, SEA, and Africa? 

While it's population isn't huge, it's still very respectable, notwithstanding the challenges of advancing median age; I postulate that shortened life expectancy may play some part in reduced economic capacity. Some other posters here have mentioned the crippling loss in military age citizens that awaits in a few decades, but how will this in turn affect economic activity given that many developed nations are also facing a similar challenge? Will automation start to become a way for states with lower populations to level the playing field? 

Corruption and criminal activity (Intl Rus Mafia) 
How significantly do these two hemorrhage the economy? Do you see any meaningful action taken to curb the two, and what would it look like? 

Foreign adventurism
This is a clear avenue from which Russia is draining its coffers. It must do so to exert itself in one of the only ways it still can on the international stage, and to protect its interests, but how long can these costly exertions be sustained? Food for thought. 
Research competitiveness

Foreign investment attractiveness/ease of doing business/international sanctions

9xit1p,Could the US reciprocate Chinese and Russian information warfare? How effectively?,"Obviously there's a fair bit of talk these days about information warfare in the US. Donald Trump's Twitter is full of references to ""fake news"" and Democrats often accuse Russian hackers and troll farms of exercising undue influence on American domestic politics. What the exact effects of information warfare are on the US seem to be anybody's guess, but I think it's fair to say that foreign attempts to spread misinformation and propaganda have probably had some detrimental effect on US national unity and the political beliefs of its citizens.

So, anyways, I'm taking the bus home from work today and I'm wondering - why hasn't the US attempted to wage any similar sort of information warfare against its geopolitical rivals? Or, if it has, why haven't I heard anything about it? I mean, I assume that if Russia can stoke political unrest in the US by employing kids to run Twitter bot farms, the US can do something similar on VK. A quick Google search, however, and the only thing I can find is something called Operation Earnest Voice, which sounds like it's more targeted at Islamic extremists than foreign powers. I know that the US’s main geopolitical rivals – Russia, China, and Iran – are all censoring and various degrees of nondemocratic, but I still imagine that using Internet social media networks to play up corruption scandals or spread fake news about - I dunno - Xi Jinping’s sex life could still do a fair bit to weaken their state apparatuses. And surely the US could find a way to get a message out if it really wanted to.

I guess that even if the US government were able to do something like this, they’d still have to want to do it. First, I’m not sure how the US public would look upon the government screwing around in the domestic politics of foreign powers– it’d obviously be rather hypocritical for the US to be engaging in information warfare right in the wake of the Russia-meddled-in-our-elections accusations. Second, I perceive the US’s main goals with regards to China and Russia (at least) to be more containment than outright destabilization. Still, from a geopolitical perspective at least, it makes sense to me for the US to attempt to weaken its foreign rivals using information warfare, especially when it would probably be pretty cheap to do and when other countries have shown no qualms about using the strategy. 

So I guess I have two questions. First, to what extent is the US engaging in information warfare with foreign powers? Second, if the US were to vigorously engage in an information warfare campaign against its geopolitical rivals, what would the likely results be?
