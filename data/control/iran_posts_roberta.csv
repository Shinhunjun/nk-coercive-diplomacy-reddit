c0gi8b,Why Iran benefits from these attacks,"So yesterday happened and the reaction I've found all across reddit has ranged from disbelief to confusion, so I thought I'd try to share my reasoning as to why I think these attacks benefit Iran the most. Given I believe that all countries involved in this mess are rational and intelligent actors(Except maybe Saudi Arabia on the intelligent  part), this means that if Iran is behind this attack then it was act of genius.


**Background**

Before we get to yesterday's events, it's worth summarizing what brought us here.
As you all know, the US has been imposing increasingly restrictive sanctions on Iran for over a year now, and has managed to dramatically decrease Iranian oil exports and coerce unwilling nations to abide by these sanctions using the threat of secondary sanctions. What's important to note here is that unlike the pre-JCPOA sanctions regime, the international buy-in is less due to desire and more due to coercion. Iran knows this.

As the US added sanction atop sanction, Iran kept threatening to shut down the strait of Hormuz in response, in the logic of ""If we can't sell our oil, neither can the Gulf states!"". The US did not take these threats lightly, which is good given Iran did not make them lightly. The first real attack on oil shipping happened last month, in a method quite similar to this attack. Iran was implicated, the West accused and warned, and we're back to the status quo. This attack however, has more sinister implications because of its timing.


**Timing of the Attack**

What sets apart last month's attacks from this one are two things related to its timing:

1) It comes after a Bolton-issued ultimatum that any attack in the Gulf will be met by a grave response.

2) It comes during a visit by the Japanese PM aimed solely at decreasing tensions.

I want to dwell on the significance of the second point, given I doubt anyone here needs an explanation about why point 1 is relevant. Why is PM Abe in Iran? No, he's not going to mediate to curry brownie-points with Trump, Japan has vital matters of national interest attached to this issue for a large chunk of its oil supply passes through these straits. It's essential that they remain open, and the country sees that this rise of tensions might threaten this supply. 

So as the Japanese PM is in Tehran trying to stave off this nightmare scenario, guess what happens? East Asia bound oil ships get attacked, and this was not lost on Japan as the government immediately stated that these ships had 'Japan-related' cargo on board. Immediately following the attack, Iran moved onto the PR front. Tweets by Khameini directed towards Japan urging it to ignore the US sanctions regime it was forced to buy into, statements by the Iranian government immediately getting ahead of the curve and setting the propaganda narrative, and even a statement saying something to the effect that Iran is the safety guarantor of the strait of Hormuz.

All of this happened and there was still radio silence from Western Capitals, who were either caught unawares or were trying to keep the markets calm or even both. 

**What is the message Iran sent?**

Through this well executed and well timed attack, Iran sent an important message to the coalition of the unwilling:

""The US is not able to guarantee freedom of navigation, and has forced you to buy into a sanctions regime you do not want to buy into and has left you to fend for yourselves as your ships get attacked in response.""

Japan and India, both importers of Iranian oil, were very reluctant about falling into line due to the threats to their oil supplies. Europe is also reluctant given the effects of any conflict would be acutely felt on the continent. And this is just the tip of the iceberg of countries that bought into Iran sanctions by coercion and also by the assumption that the US will protect them from their fears.

Even without all of that, a corner stone of US foreign policy and power is its intent and ability to keep shipping lanes open. In one fell swoop, Iran attacked this principle in a brazen way that obviously took everyone by surprise.

But if the Americans don't act to show the world that they are still guarantors of Free Navigation and that they will protect nations from the negative effects of the sanctions it forced them to buy into, then we will start seeing the unraveling of the sanctions regime sooner rather than later.

This is what the Iranians are hoping to gain from this attack, and this is why the American response in the coming days will be consequential. To me, this is a moment equal in gravity to Obama's Red Line although it might not feel like it now.",EmmanuelBassil,geopolitics,388,377,1560491318,/r/geopolitics/comments/c0gi8b/why_iran_benefits_from_these_attacks/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/c0gi8b/why_iran_benefits_from_these_attacks/,iran,2025-12-07 13:47:13,"Why Iran benefits from these attacks So yesterday happened and the reaction I've found all across reddit has ranged from disbelief to confusion, so I thought I'd try to share my reasoning as to why I think these attacks benefit Iran the most.

Turkey is complying with US sanctions to Iran even tho it had butted heads with US on such issues as the S400. UAE, KSA, Israel have given almost absurd amount of restraint with their anti-Iran sentiment than its usually expected. EU has effective stopped caring anymore with special purpose vehicle. And Fox News and CNN are talking about “Bolton’s war”. And Russia seems weirdly nonchalant about Iran- instead focused more on Venezuela. And China has been cutting its imports from Iran- which is still going on with trade deal with the USA. 

Like it feels like everything is going for Trumps favor right now. If Iran stops compliance with the JCPOA, the world will turn on Iran more so than now and if it does comply with it, US still is crippling its economy and there is no way for it to survive for 10-15 years until sunset clauses expire.

So right now, Trump is in middle of a trade deal that China that desperately wants, with Huawei ban, and CTO in extradition process and DPRK opening up more than ever.

Turkey, in middle of almost recession, having f35s blocked and tying for the EU membership and domestic policies like Istanbul win shows Erdogan is not as truly controlling. But, after US leaving Syria (I’m guessing Turkey feels was a gift from US), it would seem too much to then not send the favor to USA back. 

EU has been bit voiceful but the companies still have no opened up to Iran if they may lose US market either. And with Brexit debacle, where UK will probably side with US for a trade deal to heal Brexit, EU will have less tooth then. Especially when Trump keeps bring up NATO 2%. And after China, EU may be the new “new deal” time for Trump. Germany’s Auto sector is already sweating from sanctions with Nord stream 2.

98hrzs,"US & China talking trade, South Korea allegedly asks for an end to the Korean War, and the Department of Iranian Regime Change? - What's your take on the week that was?","Here’s our take on the week that was. We’re acutely conscious that there are many smarter, and more experienced people who frequent this sub, so we’re very keen to hear your takes.

Our three most significant stories this week:

* The US and China are now putting together a process aimed at resolving their trade dispute by November, when Xi and Trump will meet.

* South Korea allegedly asked the United States to consider formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War – in a bid to break a stall in US-North Korea talks.

* The US restructured the State Department, creating a special group focused on Iran – headed up by the former Director of Policy Planning (a very senior role). Pompeo said this is about changing Iranian behaviour, while experts said this is about changing the Iranian regime. 

Our three most thought-provoking articles of the week:

* Richard Haas, himself a former Director of Policy Planning, argued that without the glue of the Soviet threat, the US-Turkey relationship is destined to deteriorate.

* Rebecca Collard of Time Magazine gave a good overview of the stakes in Idlib, Syria – a city awaiting its fate as Assad’s tanks roll into position for a potential advance.

*  David Fickling of Bloomberg asked big questions of the fundamental economics of many of China’s Belt and Road projects, and argued that there are “echoes” of Soviet era collapse in Beijing’s misdirected spending. 

Three events to watch in the coming week:

* Whether the US and Turkey can patch over some of their many differences, after Turkey’s Foreign Minister said, “we are ready to talk about everything” so long as there’s “no threatening, no dictating”.

* Whether agreement on process can translate to agreement on sticky substantive issues at the US-China trade talks on 22 & 23 August.

* Whether US National Security Advisor John Bolton can make modest progress with Russia on arms control, at the follow up to the Trump-Putin summit.

A a full set of links to the referenced stories is available on our [site] (https://www.ambassadorsbrief.com/posts/NW8S5L7iTiwKrTMPk)

* Whether the US and Turkey can patch over some of their many differences, after Turkey’s Foreign Minister said, “we are ready to talk about everything” so long as there’s “no threatening, no dictating”.

* Whether agreement on process can translate to agreement on sticky substantive issues at the US-China trade talks on 22 & 23 August.

* Whether US National Security Advisor John Bolton can make modest progress with Russia on arms control, at the follow up to the Trump-Putin summit.

71y2bh,Thoughts on an Iranian land bridge?,"I was just wondering if folks had any thoughts on a possible extension of Iranian influence to the Mediterranean and what this possible extension’s effect would be on the security of the United States.

As ISIS fades, it seems like there may be a conflict along the Euphrates River. Most of western Syria seems to be back under the control of the Syrian government and some supporting militias, who are said to be backed by Iran. These forces seem to be moving north-east. But the north-east of Syria seems to be under the control of the SDF and U.S. special forces. Some of Eastern and southern Syria still seem to be controlled by anti-Assad forces as well.

According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-army/syrian-army-sends-more-troops-across-euphrates-close-to-u-s-backed-forces-idUSKCN1BT2B9):

 > A commander in a militia of the U.S.-backed SDF confirmed Syrian army units had crossed [to the eastern side of the Euphrates] and said his fighters were ready to drive them back.

I’ve seen some arguments that say that if the Syrian government takes back control of north-east Syria, and because Iran seems to support Shia militias in Shia majority Iraq, then Iran will have a “land bridge” through Iraq to Lebanon. I’ve also seen some arguments that say that the U.S. should launch another war against the Syrian government, these militias, and Russian special forces to defend Syria’s eastern border.

I'm under the impression that Syria has been an Iranian ally for some time, if I’m not mistaken. After the invasion of Iraq and before the Syrian Civil War, Iran reportedly began supporting Shia militias in Iraq. So it seems that Iran essentially had a land bridge during that time period. And despite having friendly governments in Syria and Lebanon, this Iranian influence did not seem to have a corrosive effect on the region. It did not seem to have an effect on American security either.

I’m wondering if, once ISIS is defeated, the US should war with the Syrian government, these militias, and Russian special forces to maintain control of Syria’s eastern border. How does that help American safety?
