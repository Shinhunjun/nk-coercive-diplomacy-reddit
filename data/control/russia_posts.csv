c4rjeg,"Why is the US more concerned about a Middle East hegemon and WMDs than Europe, Russia and China?","Why is the US more concerned about a Middle East hegemon and WMDs than Europe, Russia and China?

&#x200B;

Throughout the Cold War the US has relied on the Middle East for secure oil supplies in case of a war with the Soviet Union. The US feared the Soviets or another Middle East power such as Nasser's Arab Republic taking over and the US could no longer effectively fuel their tanks and aircraft in an arms race. The US allied with Saudi Arabia, a rather non-nationalistic, non-populist state, that would provide them oil, and the US would provide them security. US also allied with Israel by the time of the 1970s, since Israel was an effective buffer against Arab states and provided intelligence on both regional threats and terrorists.

Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the conventional large scale military threat was gone. However on 9/11, the US got a taste that history was not over and the new century has come. The US feared that terrorists would take control of Saudi Arabia and other Arab states and also feared they would get WMDs, ie. the invasion if Iraq and Afghanistan.

However, by the time of 2014, the shale revolution had begun and the US no longer relied on oil from the Middle East. China and Europe still relied on the Middle East for oil supplies. However, it seems like the US is still the most involved in the Middle East, why is this? Also the US is really concerned about WMDs still, why is this?

The theory if Iran did control the Middle East, a Russian-Iran block will be formed. Also Europe could get its oil supplies from Africa and China from Russia. US propting up Saudi Arabia is a good way to keep China and Europe in check in theory.

The first theory makes more sense. Historically, the US has always represented the anti-nationalist pro-globalization force, while Russia has been a the nationalist force, the US being very capital rich and suited for global trade while the colder more isolated Russia has been less open. US props up capital rich proxies while Russia props up nationalist ones. Saudi Arabia is an unstable state by design and it is very reliant on the United States for trade and security. A nationalist state in the Middle East like Iran would always back a state like Russia. Russia would provide Iran with weapons and security while Iran would join Russia's sphere of influence. China would have no choice but to side with the this new Eurasian alliance, them being a vital trading partner and a supplier of oil.",Mrbsct,geopolitics,24,31,1561395983,/r/geopolitics/comments/c4rjeg/why_is_the_us_more_concerned_about_a_middle_east/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/c4rjeg/why_is_the_us_more_concerned_about_a_middle_east/,russia,2025-12-08 10:55:55

It cozy’s with any US enemy it sees fit, has ambition for grander military (annexing Crimea for warm water port), and building up more upgraded military, but at the same time, it seems to be perfectly happy letting China be the main hidden power while it takes all the news. Does Russia help China to be the main superpower solely become of its hate to the US? 

Russian generals have expressed the governments weird spending habits- noting how the navy is neglected with one cattier always getting towed but all this international pressure in Crimea because of the navy militants. Yet, Russia goes toward the rockets and nuke route. While it’s inventory of massive amounts of tanks sits idell. 

So what does Russia want? Be the superpower? Make China superpower? Just be throne in the “west’s” side? In that case, honestly, can Russia even says it not the west anymore?

bi4os2,How was Russia able to annex Crimean but the UAE failed to take Socotra?,"My question is weird but it's something I don't understand and I wanted to see if someone could explain it.

In 2014, Russia occupied Crimea and then annexed it after having a referendum showing that the people wanted it. There was condemnation but Russia braved the storm and today in 2019, Crimea is a part of Russia. Although Ukraine still disputes the loss.

The UAE tried the same with the Yemeni island of Socotra in 2018, it occupied the entire island with its own soldiers (not Yemeni militiamen or mercenaries) and began handing the residents privileges like work permits to go to the UAE. When the world condemned it, the UAE backed down immediately and withdrew even going so far as to hand over half the island to Saudi Arabia and promise not to annex it.

Why didn't the UAE just copy Russia and have some sort of referendum where 87% of the Socotrans voted in favor of joining the UAE? It's an oil-rich country, I'm certain most of them would have loved the idea.

bhwtfm,The US does not spend much more than Russia and China on military-once you factor in Purchasing Power Parity(PPP)," There is this constant saying that the US ""spends the most on miltitary and you can combine the world's budget and it wouldn't equal the US"". However this is skewed because if you are looking at exchange ratios for USDs and not looking at purchasing power parity, the US does seem like this. However once you take in PPP, the US should not be much more powerful than lets say Russia and China combined. US spends also a lot on giving soldiers welfare, healthcare and paying their soldiers as a decent career.

&#x200B;

Here is the charts. $606 Billion for the US vs China's $434 in terms of PPP equivlancy. This is simply due to the fact in PPP terms, the US economy is smaller than China. You can probably buy a fighter jet in China much cheaper with less US dollars, similar how a American buys beer cheaper when going to Mexico. US does spend more on carrier and air forces, while China focuses more on land forces, so US does have the ability to hop around more around the world, and has more world bases. In terms of percentage of GDP, the US is not overwhelming to any degree and Russia spends a higher percentage.

&#x200B;

So this talk on how the US military is spending too much vs. they are not spending enough, is easy to understand. If Chin and Russia attacked tommorow, they could probalby put up a real good fight if US acted alone. However the US has its allies(NATO, SK and Japan). The debate is whether or not the US should spend much more or much less is just a balance and compromise between independent action or allies. Also, the US has to deal with Iran and North Korea, as well as fight against Jihadism.

&#x200B;

SS: The Trump presidency has begun the first administrative steps towards new arms control treaties with both Russia and China. 

Despite the article's title, the new arms control treaty envisioned does not intend to cover only nuclear weapons, but are likely aimed to bring new classes of weapon systems under purview as well.

President Trump has formed a reputation for breaking and making economic and political treaties with countries it has close ties or interests in the two years of his presidency. He personally cites the ""hundreds of billions of dollars spent on weapons"" as a reason for arms control, and ""should include all the weapons, all the warheads, all the missiles"".

Arms control treaties are typically the most difficult kind of deal to make though, since the speed of a deal depends on how much leverage one side has over another, and since the arms are the leverage itself,  no one makes arms control treaties with unequal sides.

Historically, arms treaties with the Soviet Union took decades, with a number of failures along the way.",GreatSunBro,geopolitics,23,18,1556302990,/r/geopolitics/comments/bhpn78/trump_orders_staff_to_prepare_armscontrol_push/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/bhpn78/trump_orders_staff_to_prepare_armscontrol_push/,russia,2025-12-08 10:55:55

bb4ya0,Is there a way forward for Russia?,"The Russian economy has been less than great since around 2013 when oil prices started to fall, than sanctions after the Crimea incident in 2014 which only made things much worse as inflation shot up.

After the ensuing recession the government noticeably moved to try and boost agriculture, technology start ups, etc. But it proved somewhat ineffective in removing the ruble away from oil due to the inherent corruption and the very unfriendly way oligarchs do business. 

So when Putin leaves office(?), will the government be forced to significantly reform? A big reason for the popularity of Putin is people hold him responsible for an economic resurgence but now that it's done with....can the government retain control without effective economic diversification?

What the current situation in Russia reminds me of is Brezhnev era stagnation in the USSR, the Politburo opted for strong short term growth in resources during the '60s but it wasn't sustainable into the 70s(when the country was also being sanctioned) so it economically stagnated for years. Much similar to the resource driven growth of the 2000s then the following stagnation in the 2010s. With no end in sight as oil prices show no sign of returning to their pre 2009 highs. I wonder if reform is the only way forward and the system Putin thinks he built simply cannot survive the low oil prices and continued sanctions.",BR2049isgreat,geopolitics,57,90,1554794427,/r/geopolitics/comments/bb4ya0/is_there_a_way_forward_for_russia/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/bb4ya0/is_there_a_way_forward_for_russia/,russia,2025-12-08 10:55:55

bwoew8,"Possibilities of Russian invasion on Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova","Peter Zeihan once predicted the war between Russia and Europe in his book *The Absent Superpower*. After the collapse of USSR, Russia has been suffered from demographic crisis(population decline) and harsher geography for defense (borderline is closer to capital Moscow and the length of borderline is much longer). In order to get rid of strategical inferiority, Russian would try to retake some ex-USSR countries back and make Russian demographics and borderline more decent and stable. Military interventions in Crimea and Donbass region are just one of the first phase strategic actions, regaining its influence on East Europe. The next would be invading and annexing these ex-communist countries. According to him, Russia should hurry up before Russian military became too small to take military actions at least decently from youth population decline. The below is the summary of his proposed Russian strategy.

https://i.redd.it/d25v2nv71c231.jpg

Of course, his overall thought has gone too far. He even suggested the war between Russia and some NATO states(3 Baltic States, part of Poland and Romania)/Caucasus region. Directly confronting and fighting NATO would be suicide for Russia. Getting involved in Caucasus would be also disastrous, considering Russian history that getting entangled in just Chechen region for a long time. However, if Russia ends its expansion on invading and annexing non-NATO and non-Caucasian states such as Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, the overall strategy might be a little bit rational for Russia.

So, what I want to discuss is the scenario that **Russia tries to invade and annex Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova**. what do you think of this scenario? It is relatively realistic?

bsymk5,The Russian military doesn't need to conquer Europe-Its energy market has already," All this talk from geopolticial forcasters that Russians is a ""cornered snake"" and that do to the slow economy, population decline,  and lagging tech base, that it is best time to invade Europe. However, I don't think this is even needed for Russia's geopolitical interests: ie security on the North European plain, the security more arable land, and security of more warm water ports. 

 Almost all of Eastern Europe relies on Russian energy ie. Russian oil and gas. Germany is very reliant on Russian gas and Nordstream 2 bypasses the need for maintence in Ukraine. So so these Eastern European nations may hate Russia, but when push comes to shove, it is not like they will do anything about it. That means a increasingly Russian leaning political leaning. Hell Russia may be even to lease a port in the future.

The security risk from the US military is effectively nullified. First off, the US has no reason to invade Russia, and I think Putin knows this. The US military has no interests in Europe other than the command base against the Middle East and the security of its markets(which are declining) Increasingly, Russia has the capability to sanction anyone who support abrubt US actions. Unless Russia blantantly attacks triggering Article 5, Russia is fairly secure. 

  
Second of all, Russia will have a tough time take Europe. Russia is not the Soviet Union with top tier tanks and fighter planes. Germany and France are major players in the EU and will not see their assets invaded in Eastern Europe and use their forces to defend. The Soviets had a population of 300 million now Russia only has a population of around 100 million. Not a lot of infantry to recruit compared to a massive EU. How about tanks. Their latest tank the Armata simply can't be mass produced, and most of their tanks are upgraded Cold War T-72s. How about fighters? Many of the EU will buying the American F-35 the next generation stealth fighter, and China is countering their J-20. Russia is failing to produce their next generation stealth fighter. Navy?

bha9rm,Will a fuel dependent EU give way for an era of Russian political dominance in the region?," Many have said a lot of Europe's Green energy intiatives are failing and now still very dependent on Russia gas and oil. Germany and Russia has built NordStream 2 which links the sea to bypassing Poland and Ukraine. This give Russia incredible leverage and allows German independent private contractor companies to potentially lobby politicians to favor more pro-Russian policies such as better trade deals, less involvement in the Ukraine and less emphasis on NATO.  Ukraine and Poland have to suck up to Russia for now if they don't shipments could be cut off. The election of the more pro-Russian Ukrainian President may be proof. 

While the US is pulling back on a lot of Mid-East conflicts, the EU is also reliant on nations like Saudi Arabia and Iran for fuel. The EU nations are in no condition of having the same presence as the US. This places the EU in a bad spot where it is cut off from everyone else, and too reliant on exports.",Warriormind556,geopolitics,2,12,1556207713,/r/geopolitics/comments/bha9rm/will_a_fuel_dependent_eu_give_way_for_an_era_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/bha9rm/will_a_fuel_dependent_eu_give_way_for_an_era_of/,russia,2025-12-08 10:55:55

azv0aa,How could the US increase friendly relations with India while making it so that Russian-Indian relations deteriorate?,"India is growing at a rapid pace both economically and in population. It is set to soon surpass China as the most populace country on the planet. GDP annual growth rate in India averaged 6.21% from 1951 until 2018, reaching an all time high of 11.40% in the first quarter of 2010. Obviously, India is becoming a major player on the world stage.

Knowing this, would it not be in the U.S.' interests to improve relations with India while at the same time trying to weaken India's relations with Russia? If India were an American ally, that would give the US massive influence in Asia that could work to contain China.

From what I've seen, India and Indians love Russia. I don't know the details as to why, but I always see Indians online praise Russia and call each other best friends. Indian attitudes towards Americans, I've noticed, are generally either neutral or bitter. One thing that Americans and Indians do have in common, however, is distrust/fear of China.

So is the US taking any steps to improve relations with India? If so, what are they?

al9xim,The case for Russian engagement in the Korean peninsula,"The case for Russian engagement in the Korean peninsula

Submission Statement:

Russia is today a ""former"" great power trying to restore its past glory. Yet, they are hindered by demographic, economic and political difficulties which are hard to overcome. They are aging fast, they are dying fast and they have enemies everywhere. Some western analysts are saying that China and Russia are getting closer than ever, and that it is a big threat which needs to be addressed. They are correct to a certain degree. But they need to realize that Russia is actually more afraid of China than Europe or the USA. They share a massive land-border and if Russia fails to modernize its economy, they will become essentially a vassal state to China. The recent Sino-Russian alignment is nothing but the result of immediate concerns and has no solid foundation. The real big player and threat is China. Therefore, I would like to argue that Russia must be lured to our side by providing her with tangible benefits, and Korea could play a key role in making that happen. 

First, it is necessary to note that the ""Korean Question"" is one of the most crucial flashpoints in East Asia. North Korea must be restrained but they won't unless they get something in return. However, last year has been a phase of great pacification by giving momentum to diplomacy and negotiations. Now, the US and North Korea are vying for some kind of compromise. In the process, South Korea has repeatedly advocated for a Russian engagement. We have made explicit our plans for railroads and pipelines. So, what does this mean?

South Korea is the second largest importer of natural gas in the world. Russia needs to diversify its customer base. They are almost entirely relying on Western Europe and their relations are sour at best. South Korea can provide cash for oil/gas and we can invest in Russia to build factories and create jobs. On the other hand, Korea can make its industry more competitive by lowering energy costs and therefore generating more wealth for the country. Should South Korea become richer and stronger, we could afford to pay more for US forces and we could buy more US weapons.

South Korea can serve as a gateway for Russia for foreign markets too. Russia's Far East will have more jobs and more factories, more goods. We will bring them via railway to our markets and we can re-export them to the outer world. 

If Russia gets a regular continous and reliable source of income by establishing closer connection with South Korea, by having North Korea as a road, then Russia will have more than enough incentives to restrain North Korea's behavior. Russia has a land-border with North Korea, and Russia has the willpower to engage militarily if a third-rate power crosses in their path. 

A Russo-Korean (South) cooperation with the benediction of the US will serve as a good encircling web against China. It will enrich South Korea, it will enrich (to a certain degree) Russia and reduce their dependency of China, it will restrain North Korea by making them content to have a rent revenue. All the parties involved would be satisfied and reduce the risks of armed conflict. Therefore, I'd argue that South Korea needs a new Nordpolitik focusing on Russia, and that the US/EU should seek a rapprochement with Russia to counterbalance the immense threat that China poses to the whole world.

aj4642,Question: Russian Air Base in Venezuela logic and update?,"I can't quite remember where Venezuela's main refining/export site for their oil sits. However, I only recently heard Russia has announced intentions to build a military installation on the island of La Orchila just north of the mainland. It seems to me that in addition to the American orientation of the strategic placement of such a base, locking in a lease would potentially put Russian planes within stroking distance of Venezuelas only oil export option, thereby giving the Russians a pressurepoint to use on whatever regime goes on to administer Venezuela. 

I suppose I have 3 easy questions: 1) if someone can remind me what main port Venezuela's oil is exported from? 2) if there has been any update to Russia's plan to build a base, maybe they've changed their minds until the unrest has settled? And 3) if this seems like a reasonable analysis, and/or if someone has anything interesting to add?

agvfby,Russian expansion in the Arctic,"Will the Russian Arctic become the next major global natural resource area? 

Having read many articles related to the Russian-Arctic issue, which (as for me) have lately been appearing in the Media more and more often, I’ve realized that the question is on everyone’s mind… if not of everyone’s concern. 

Maybe, there are actual grounds. Let’s see. 

Take for example the *Northern Latitudinal Railway*, a Russian governmental railroad project. Its construction will be completed by 2023 and is going to free capacity on Trans-Siberian route and connect the Yamal Peninsula to the Russian rail network. 

Another project, based on a latitudinal approach is the so-called *Belkomur,* a railroad that is aimed at direct connection of such regions as Siberia and Ural with the Northwest of Russia. And what is more, it is highly likely that China’s railway will also be connected to this project in time. That actually causes my concern too, because the linkage of such powerful countries would pose significant economic challenges for Europe and the USA in terms of winning natural resources in the Arctic. 

The concerns seem to be confirmed even by the U.S. Navy that is **planning to expand its role in the Arctic**, naming Russia and China “great-power rivals for influence in the far north”. 

And I keep thinking whether we can address this “Arctic challenge”, given China’s financial superiority and Russia’s territorial one.

a63ocm,Why is the Russian Economy so weak?,"Hey guys, 

I'd like to have a discussion on this topic, given the popular consensus that Russia is on a slow decline and unable to compete as a world power due to its weak economy. It seems bizarre, given how powerful the USSR was at its peak; I have even seen some posters here cast doubt on whether the Russian Federation will maintain statehood within the next half century. This topic certainly bears further investigation as it will inform Russia's relations with other powers and how it selects its alignments. 

I will start off with some of my thoughts, and encourage others to critique, add to them and/or use them as a base for injecting additional insight. 

Firstly, I suspect that the chaos that followed the fall of the USSR laid the seeds for dysfunction. To what extent, and in what manner, I would seek clarification on. Did Western exploitation wreak deep wounds that are still felt today, or are the damages from that time largely past? 

I realize that some large part of Russia's economic troubles have to do with an oligarchy of resource barons who stymie any real forays into diversifying the economy or moving away from resource exportation, but surely, given Russia's immense territory, it's utter lack of proportional heft is baffling. Given the expanding trade relations between Russia and the PRC, do you think the relationship will remain resource heavy? It does not seem like a sustainable approach to me and Russia could do better. 

This large expanse of territory does come with its curse of course. The logistical nightmare involved in keeping the country togethe is quite unenviable. Aging infrastructure needs to be maintained, extensive military hardware has to be kept up to date, all to the backdrop of harsh climatic conditions which exacerbate upkeep costs. Russia's only warm water port in Vladivostok still sees significant downtime due to inclement weather, and is located on an extreme of the country. How debilitating is this for trade aspirations beyond Eurasia? Namely the Americas, SEA, and Africa? 

While it's population isn't huge, it's still very respectable, notwithstanding the challenges of advancing median age; I postulate that shortened life expectancy may play some part in reduced economic capacity. Some other posters here have mentioned the crippling loss in military age citizens that awaits in a few decades, but how will this in turn affect economic activity given that many developed nations are also facing a similar challenge? Will automation start to become a way for states with lower populations to level the playing field? 

Corruption and criminal activity (Intl Rus Mafia) 
How significantly do these two hemorrhage the economy? Do you see any meaningful action taken to curb the two, and what would it look like? 

Foreign adventurism
This is a clear avenue from which Russia is draining its coffers. It must do so to exert itself in one of the only ways it still can on the international stage, and to protect its interests, but how long can these costly exertions be sustained? Food for thought. 
Research competitiveness

Foreign investment attractiveness/ease of doing business/international sanctions
Does the current administration's policy discourage foreign business or investment? If so, how and why? Are foreigners put off by perceived barriers to entry? Are sanctions making a sizable dent in growth numbers?

Sorry for the fall off in quality. It's getting late and I just wanted to kick this off.

Take it away fellows. ",Loralius,geopolitics,69,99,1544783162,/r/geopolitics/comments/a63ocm/why_is_the_russian_economy_so_weak/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/a63ocm/why_is_the_russian_economy_so_weak/,russia,2025-12-08 10:55:55

9xit1p,Could the US reciprocate Chinese and Russian information warfare? How effectively?,"Obviously there's a fair bit of talk these days about information warfare in the US. Donald Trump's Twitter is full of references to ""fake news"" and Democrats often accuse Russian hackers and troll farms of exercising undue influence on American domestic politics. What the exact effects of information warfare are on the US seem to be anybody's guess, but I think it's fair to say that foreign attempts to spread misinformation and propaganda have probably had some detrimental effect on US national unity and the political beliefs of its citizens.

So, anyways, I'm taking the bus home from work today and I'm wondering - why hasn't the US attempted to wage any similar sort of information warfare against its geopolitical rivals? Or, if it has, why haven't I heard anything about it? I mean, I assume that if Russia can stoke political unrest in the US by employing kids to run Twitter bot farms, the US can do something similar on VK. A quick Google search, however, and the only thing I can find is something called Operation Earnest Voice, which sounds like it's more targeted at Islamic extremists than foreign powers. I know that the US’s main geopolitical rivals – Russia, China, and Iran – are all censoring and various degrees of nondemocratic, but I still imagine that using Internet social media networks to play up corruption scandals or spread fake news about - I dunno - Xi Jinping’s sex life could still do a fair bit to weaken their state apparatuses. And surely the US could find a way to get a message out if it really wanted to.

I guess that even if the US government were able to do something like this, they’d still have to want to do it. First, I’m not sure how the US public would look upon the government screwing around in the domestic politics of foreign powers– it’d obviously be rather hypocritical for the US to be engaging in information warfare right in the wake of the Russia-meddled-in-our-elections accusations. Second, I perceive the US’s main goals with regards to China and Russia (at least) to be more containment than outright destabilization. Still, from a geopolitical perspective at least, it makes sense to me for the US to attempt to weaken its foreign rivals using information warfare, especially when it would probably be pretty cheap to do and when other countries have shown no qualms about using the strategy. 

So I guess I have two questions. First, to what extent is the US engaging in information warfare with foreign powers? Second, if the US were to vigorously engage in an information warfare campaign against its geopolitical rivals, what would the likely results be? Would the US benefit?",C4rlos_D4nger,geopolitics,31,35,1542342083,/r/geopolitics/comments/9xit1p/could_the_us_reciprocate_chinese_and_russian/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/9xit1p/could_the_us_reciprocate_chinese_and_russian/,russia,2025-12-08 10:55:55

bkn9yk,How does Putin’s autocracy differ from Erdogan’s autocracy?,"It seems to me that Erdogan is more despotic than Putin.
Whereas Putin tries to give some semblance of democracy, Erdogan has a more Mussolini-like approach, not to mention a similar way of speaking and acting. 

But we would be correct in saying that Putin is the more imperialistic out of the two. 
Whereas Erdogan focuses his forces on Syria, Putin stretches his army throughout Europe, the Middle East, South America and even the Arctic. 

But when it comes fo internal politics, whats the difference? Is Putin more like Louis XIV? 
A powerful leader surrounded by wealthy aristocrats (the Russian oligarchs) or is he more like a Caesar, a man’s man that commands armies and rules the country with an iron fist? Sounds more like Erdogan",Robert_de_Saint_Loup,geopolitics,38,15,1556989544,/r/geopolitics/comments/bkn9yk/how_does_putins_autocracy_differ_from_erdogans/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/bkn9yk/how_does_putins_autocracy_differ_from_erdogans/,russia,2025-12-08 10:55:55

a3r2bg,Attended a speech given by Michael McFaul last night. He had a lot of great info and an interesting hypothesis about Putin,"He felt confident saying the Yeltsin and Clinton had a great relationship, and people felt as if the fall of the Soviet Union could lead to a successor state that is friendly to the US, much like what happened after the fall of the Japanese Empire and the Nazi Reich. He admitted that he wasn’t actually dictating US policy towards Russia at the time, so he admits that this is an unprofessional opinion.

He says that during Medvedev’s administration, the US-Russia relations were the best they had been in 70 years. He pointed to the fact that, when polled, Russians had overall positive opinions of Americans, and Americans had positive opinions of Russia. Russia also helped immensely with getting Iran to negotiate on the Iran deal.

Putin was disgusted by Medvedev fostering warm relations with the US, which is why he took the presidency back and immediately burned all the bridges that Medvedev built with Obama. 

The impression throughout the speech that I got is that Putin has been the main deterrent stopping cooperation between the US and Russian regime. Someone asked him later that, if Putin is to blame for the breakdown in relations, if a post-Putin Russia would try to restore relations. His response was that Putin’s successor will likely follow this “Putinism” ideology that treats the West the same way the USSR did.",ChristianMB1,geopolitics,219,77,1544123065,/r/geopolitics/comments/a3r2bg/attended_a_speech_given_by_michael_mcfaul_last/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/a3r2bg/attended_a_speech_given_by_michael_mcfaul_last/,russia,2025-12-08 10:55:55

9keutk,"Russia's Ambitious ""Power Of Siberia"" Project ; Energy Deal Worth Half A Trillion Dollars To Supply China with Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Almost Complete ; Hailed by Pres. Putin as the ""Deal of the Century""","Background: Back in 2014, Russia and China signed an ambitious energy deal worth $400 Billion, hailed by Putin as the ""Deal of the Century."" Both Pres. Putin and Pres. Xi were present at the signing ceremony. Hailed as another milestone in closer cooperation and relations between the two neighbors. At the time, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine as the pro-Russian Ukrainian government was overthrown by a pro-West government. The West (US, EU, and its strategic Allies), in retaliation, slapped sanctions and cut Russia off from much of the West's financial institutions. This caused the Russian economy to take a big nose dive from $2.2 trillion GDP in 2014 to $1.2 trillion in $2016. Historically, relations between the West and Russia has always been that of conflict, suspicion, and mistrust.

&#x200B;

History of Post-USSR Russia-China cooperation: The West from the very beginning of the Post-USSR collapse has been on the push to chip away Russia's sphere of influences. This is true since many former Warsaw Pact and Soviet states are now part of the EU and/or are members of NATO. The West's punitive sanctions further reinforces the idea that Russia cannot fully trust the West in cooperation, and it paid dearly by putting most her eggs in the West's basket. This is not the first time the West went against Russia's interests.

Two notable examples were the Bombing of Belgrade and the Battle of Grozny. During the Yugoslav wars, the West went on the UN Security Council to bring a resolution for NATO military intervention. Russia and China vetoed it, but the West went in and bombed Belgrade anyway. This drew major condemnation from Russia, who was very opposed to the West's interference towards its former client state's internal affairs and also China, ironically, whose embassy in Belgrade ""accidentally"" got bombed by NATO warplanes, wounding 10 and killing 3 Chinese journalists. This soured the relations between Russia and the West at the time.

When Chechen terrorists from the newly independent state of Chechnya invaded Russia's territory, Dagestan. Russia retaliated by launching a massive operation intent on removing the islamic terrorist run state and retaking Chechnya after Russia lost during the 1st Chechen War. The West reacted negatively against Russia, especially against Russia during the Battle of Grozny, where many civilians died. The West even contemplated putting sanctions on Russia while China supported Russias operation;

quote: (On December 9, 1999, at a meeting with Li Peng, People's Republic of China's legislative chairman and the communist government's most hard-line leader, Boris Yeltsin told reporters he wanted to send a message to Clinton, who had criticized Russia for causing civilian casualties in Chechnya. ""It seems Mr. Clinton has forgotten Russia is a great power that possesses a nuclear arsenal. We aren't afraid at all of Clinton's anti-Russian position. I want to tell President Clinton that he alone cannot dictate how the world should live, work and play. It is us who will dictate,"" Yeltsin said. Yeltsin and President of the People's Republic of China Jiang Zemin discussed both criticized U.S. global dominance. ""Jiang Zemin completely understands and fully supports Russia's actions in combatting terrorism and extremism in Chechnya,"" Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said afterwards. Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China ""understands and supports the efforts made by Russia in safeguarding national unity and territorial integrity."")

&#x200B;

China and Russia have consistently agreed and voted together and support each other on key issues in the UN Security Council such as Iran, Syria, North Korea, Venezuela etc. Not only do they cooperate extensively geopolitically, they also cooperate economically on a huge scale. This is further reinforced by the signing of the biggest energy deal Russia ever had even when it governed as the USSR. The $400 billion deal where Russia will invest $55 billion in building a pipeline all the way from Siberia to China, delivering LNG to the economic giant as it seeks to be less dependent on coal and reduce pollution, while also finding more reliable sources of energy. This represents a major win for both sides as Russia was able to secure major access to China's market and earn much needed money to help weather the West's sanctions as fossil fuels still take of over half of Russia's exports, while China has secured another major source of energy to power its economic engine, especially from the current trade war with the US, China needs as much safe reliable sources it can get and lower dependence on American LNG. This pipeline is currently 93% complete, and may become operational next year. The Siberian pipeline will then begin sending 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas each year and a grand total of 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas over the contracts 30 year period. As China's appetite for energy grows more and more, the infrastructure in the future will continue to send natural gas to China for generations to come. This level of cooperation is only possible because of the high levels of trust between Russia and China compared to the West, who already stabbed Russia too many times in the back for such a degree of cooperation to take place.The Russia economy finally came out of recession and started recovering to $1.5 trillion GDP in 2017 as Russia starts reorienting its economy more to the East, to China especially.

&#x200B;

As a sign of further economic cooperation, plans are undergoing for the construction of a second pipeline dubbed ""Power of Siberia 2"" which could potentially send another 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Should at some point both become operational at the same time, Russia alone will send 68 billion cubic meters of natural gas to China, representing a huge share in China's growing LNG imports.

""NPR's Frank Langfitt reports from Shanghai that in 2018, Russia will begin sending 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas to China each year through the pipeline. Over the life of the 30-year contract, 1 trillion cubic meters would be delivered.

Frank says that Alexey Miller, the chief executive of the Russian company, Gazprom, has said the exact price was a commercial secret, but that the deal is estimated at $400 billion total. Gazprom shares rose 2 percent on the news.

**As 65 year old Putin goes on his last period as President he enacts the unpopular but necessary reforms, taking the heat for his successor.**

It did not take long for the lights to go out on Luzhniski Stadium before the protest started against the Russian President. The second honeymoon period after the Crimea invasion and 80+ pct approval rate is over, now the next years will be though and painful as Russia adopts to the new demographic, aging population and new world order.

The economic situation in Russia has put pressure on Putin. He drives Russia like a hybrid between electoral democracy and a feudalism where the nobility is however who is in Putin nearest circle, all supported by the clergy of public sector, security services and other bureaucrats.

Now this sector is the one that Putin really needs the support of, and he has it as long as the sector gets better than average pensions, salaries and gets a free pass for the many small bribes that they receive. The economic sanctions has made sure that these benefits are smaller and less regular than in the golden period of 2002-2010 of Russian economy, and that hurts Putin on a personal level.

The two [recent](https://echo.msk.ru/blog/planperemen/2235330-echo/) regulations to stop the negative economic trend shows a regime where the man on the top is preparing to make thing easier for their successor.

**VAT and Pensions**

The first announcement of the pension age came very fast in the first celebrations of the victory against Egypt, with reactions just as expected. Demonstrations and fall in Putins [approval](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/07/19/vladimir-putins-approval-ratings-are-dropping-this-is-why/?utm%5C_term=.2954887eaf6d).

From 62 pct in June to 49 pct just a month later. For people that follow U.S politics know that the 50 pct threshold is the magic number. 49 pct approval in a country where Putin has control off Media, security and finances is worrying for many people in Moscow. Especially in a time where Russia just concluded a successful World Cup. Similar polls show equally drop in faith when it comes to Russia economical future.

Now, the increase in pension from 60 to 65 for men and from 55 to 63 for women is alienating but necessary in a country where average lifespan has gone up 6 yrs since 2013. (Females would have in average 22 yrs as pensioners without the increase),

However the VAT increase also recently [announced](https://www.rferl.org/a/putin-signs-measure-to-raise-russia-s-vat/29412635.html) shows that its not just a needed calibration of the social structure but a desperate measure to stop the economic stagnation of the country. While it can be defended that the retirement needed to change, the VAT increase could be seen as a unnecessary confrontation with the Russian people.

VAT hurts everyone, and its spread equally to all of the segments of the supporters of Putin, the middle class, the poor and not at least the public sector that is the fundament of Putin support.

**Sanctions hurts**

This two actions combined with a recently signed a package of law that allows Russia-controlled foreign offshore companies to be re-registered in offshore financial centers, established in Russia\\\&#39;s Kaliningrad Region and Primorsky Territory in order to minimize the possible consequences of sanctions and political risks from foreign countries, show that the sanctions are hurting Russia more than they will admit.

The real pressure for Putin is when his inner circle of oligarchs gets less spoil to share among them. After being cut of from lucrative contracts in the western world, Putin appeased them by giving their companies mega-contracts in Russia. The Kerch bridge and the different stadiums for the World cup just to mention a few. The money for these projects has now dried up and there is no more room for financial corruption to be spent.

People who have studied Putin has stated that the Russian president biggest fear is to be dragged out of the Kremlin by the Russian people, not a unprecedented fear considering the story of the country. When it is less money to go around, people use violence to get their share and no one is more proned for fight than the higher hierachy of russian power. Maria Snegovaya [writes](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/644196%5C_cd984c793c1642b2b7f5ff21ac4e4af5.pdf) that evidence suggests that economic sanctions are fostering a divide between (1) the groups that profit from Western money (Russia’s “oligarchs”), and (2) those who wield state power and/or profit from the domestic budget. (Russia’s siloviki).

For those who has read Russian history knows the consequence that will come of a clash between these two powers.

7a36o0,"If the Russian Federation would propose its Far East region for sale to the People’s Republic of China for $500 billion, would Beijing accept Kremlin's offer?","Sorry for my English, please.

Details of my request:

I'm not speaking about the probability of such proposition by Russian. I do understands, this probability is somewhere very-very near 0%. What I am asking for and interested in, is **the Chinese government reaction on it.**

Russian Far East the name of historical region, terrestrially almost identical to the current administrative division called [Far Eastern Federal District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Eastern_Federal_District). 

You also can look at the [Russian Far East map](https://i.imgur.com/Op6cxak.jpg).
Population: around 6 million people, or 4% of Russian total population.
Area: around 6,200,000 square kilometers, or 36% of total Russian area.

Assume that Russian proposition include such unconditional provisions:

- $500 billion, direct compensation to Russian government;
- immediate Chinese citizenship to every resident of Far East region, if such resident claims his/her will to receive Chinese citizenship;
- $100 thousand given to every person who wish to relocate to Russian proper territories and would reject Chinese citizenship + compensation for property and untransferable assets at the full market prices of year before;
- $20 thousand given to every person who wish to stay in Far East region, receive immediate Chinese citizenship and renounce the Russian citizenship, after Chinese authorities receive proof of such renunciation;
- 10 years citizenry deferral period, during which residents of Far East region are allowed to hold two citizenship's (however, not receiving any transition bonus/compensation mentioned above). After 10 years governments of China and Russia are allowed to denounce citizenship of non-resident dual citizens;
- every Chinese citizen, who was Russian citizen and legal resident of Far Eastern Federal District at the moment of sovereignty transition, would be provided with social protections at levels not below levels of the same year in Russia, with no time limits, forever: pensions, medical care, etc. (For example: government pension to certain category of retirees in China is lower than in Russia, then China will pay higher pension to its citizens of this categories, who were Russian citizens and FEDF residents at the time of transition);
- $150 billion would be payed for the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Navy and all military infrastructure of the region, excluding nuclear arsenal, which would be relocated to the Russian proper territory at Chinese expenses.

In total it bring us no less than $1 trillion.
But consider: territory of Russian Far East - 6,2 million square kilometers. Territory of China - 9,5 million square kilometer.

How do you think, would Chinese government agree or reject such offer?

Thanks.
