ebinxv,"I’m Gregory Warner, host of the NPR podcast Rough Translation. I’ve reported in Ukraine on and off over the years. After the impeachment hearings put the country in a global spotlight and peace talks with Russia began, I went back to Ukraine. Ask me anything about my reporting.","Our time is up! Any of these questions could lead to long discussions so I'm sorry there wasn't more time to dig into all this. Happy to do it again sometime. Meanwhile, I hope you'll check out our episodes and feel free to email me at gwarner@npr.org or write me on Twitter: [@radiogrego](https://twitter.com/radiogrego). And tell friends about the episodes! You can find more of our episodes on our homepage: https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510324/rough-translation.

Thanks! — Gregory


Here I am, ready to answer your questions:  https://i.redd.it/ofxcww75ch441.jpg

I’m looking forward to talking to you about the state of Ukraine is right now, in this unusual moment in time: When a comedian runs the country and is trying a new approach to fight corruption while a global chess match is being played out between Russia and the United States to gain Ukraine’s loyalty. Ukraine finds itself in the middle of U.S. politics as Democrats pursue impeachment against President Trump. Add also that Russian disinformation challenges Ukrainians’ own perception of themselves and their place in the world. 

Here’s the latest from our recent series:

Episode 1: https://www.npr.org/2019/11/19/780959294/ukraine-part-1-race-against-the-machine

Episode 2: https://www.npr.org/2019/12/04/784746019/whose-ukraine-is-it-anyway

Rough Translation has won awards from the Overseas Press Club and Scripps Howard Foundation, and I am a Poynter Fellow in Journalism at Yale. Before I joined NPR, [I climbed mountains with smugglers in Pakistan](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/369/poultry-slam-2008/act-one) for This American Life, [descended into illegal mine shafts in the Democratic Republic of Congo](https://beta.prx.org/stories/36060) for Marketplace's ""Working"" series, and [dragged my accordion across Afghanistan on the trail of the ""Afghan Elvis""](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/segments/91639-afghan-elvis) for WNYC's Radiolab.

I'll start answering questions at 2 p.m. EST.

eh9vl9,What is Russia's long term plan in Georgia?,"I'd like to preface this by saying that my parents took me as a baby out of Georgia in Dec 91 so my view is certainly biased and my questions will focus on Georgia. Therefore, if anyone can offer insight on the situation in Moldova (Ukraine is a quite different story) that would of course also be welcome. 

I've tried to talk to family friends / extended family still living in Georgia about this question but it is impossible to get a grasp of the issue. If you thought Russia had a strong internet propaganda game in the West, you'd think what they do in Georgia (and other former Soviet states afaik) is out of this world.

The impression I've gotten is that the Abkhazians truly want independence and if Russia wasn't involved in the situation Tbilisi and Sokhumi could work out some sort of deal, but as long as Russia is sitting at the negotiating table the Georgians refuse to participate in negotiations. As for the South Ossetians, my impression is that they don't really care either way. The ethnic Georgians who lived there have all been displaced and the remaining people there don't really care either way, and have no true desire for independence; they are just tired of the whole situation. 

What I want to know is what's in the title, is there any consensus on this? Is it simply to keep Georgia out of NATO/EU and keep the (soft) occupation going indefinitely for this purpose? Or is the goal an eventual full occupation/annexation of the country? To me it seems like they could keep it going for pretty much as long as they want, because things like [kidnapping civilians](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-georgia-conflict-detention/south-ossetia-releases-imprisoned-georgian-doctor-idUSKBN1YW091) and [slowly moving the border](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/lens/living-on-the-shifting-border-of-georgia-and-russia.html) rarely gets any international traction, and there is pretty much nothing tiny Georgia can do to stand up to Russia.",Cosmic_Dong,geopolitics,21,9,1577646217,/r/geopolitics/comments/eh9vl9/what_is_russias_long_term_plan_in_georgia/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/eh9vl9/what_is_russias_long_term_plan_in_georgia/,post_hanoi,russia,2025-12-12 17:32:42

ebtbcr,Russia or China-Who is actually in the dominant position?,"Russia or China who is actually the geopolitical and geoeconomic dominant position.

While China does have the larger economy and probably a much more powerful military by now, it is very dependent on foreign fuel supplies. It cannot afford to be international pariah(yet) otherwise an oil embargo from the US Saudi Arabia (or a a straight up US blockade) would be disastrous. Xi may not be able to get on Putin's bad side for China will need Russia to give it oil supplies if international pariahdom does come. Unlike Russia, China is surronded by far more enemies. 

Now BRI is a good way for China to traverse its way to more oil from both Central Asia and Iran. The problem I see is that Central Asia is still very Kremlin friendly and Iran(I think) is far more closer to Putin, a major weapon supplier and security guarantee of its proxies.

In order for China to break out of this deadlock, it must invest in alternative energy sources(its doing that) as well as strengthen its blue water navy(trying to) as well as buy a larger tactical nuclear arsenal to potentially fight a land battle in Central Asia.(\~600 warheads by 2025). China in the meantime offer Russia more strategic partnerships and cooperation, a good example China offering Russia 5G while Russia offering China oil.

ebjqjl,Russia poses a greater and more immediate threat to NATO than China in the short term. (Long read),"For the past three years since leaving the military, I've been working as an analyst for a geopolitical think tank with a particular focus on Russian affairs. (I'd prefer to leave them nameless as quite obviously not every opinion I've espoused on Reddit is representative of their work).

I should specify, that within the halls of power (government, military planning and intelligence agencies) the notion that the military threat posed by Russia exceeds that of China, is not an unpopular or particularly controversial opinion at all, however among the broader general public - and specifically here on Reddit, there seems to be a prevailing attitude that the threat posed by Russia is significantly less or even at times, non-existent.

To understand why Russia poses such a serious threat to the west and why it is more immediate than that posed by China we must first understand the broader strategic and foreign policy objectives of both the Russian and Chinese governments.

Russian foreign policy objectives can broadly be defined as a desire to prevent further eastern expansion of NATO and to re-integrate former territories of the USSR back into their sphere of influence. [\[1\]](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1800/RR1826/RAND_RR1826.pdf)

Russia recognises that is no longer a peer competitor to the United States and it's global hegemony, but seeks to gain further regional influence in both Eastern Europe and the Middle East in order to secure it's position as a major player on the world stage. [\[2\]](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/02/20/russia-s-global-ambitions-in-perspective-pub-78067)

China, for it's part, sees itself as an emerging global superpower that will inevitably be able to challenge US hegemony in the near future.

It too has irredentist ambitions in it's region, most notably the re-integration of Hong Kong, Macau and the eventual unification of Taiwan with the mainland, however at present, China is largely content to bide it's time and gain increased leverage or influence over other nations by peaceful means (trade, infrastructure investments, development assistance etc) rather than militaristic means. This is best surmised by Xi Jinping's signature initiative, the [Belt and Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative), as well as by former Chinese premier Hu Jintao's own signature initiative the [Peaceful rise of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%27s_peaceful_rise).

Russia on the other hand - has already engaged in significant military interventions against it's neighbours, assassinations at home and abroad, global influence campaigns - and threatening rhetoric to accomplish it's geopolitical aims.

These actions have bought them into direct opposition to NATO on several occasions already and the risk of further escalation is seemingly inevitable.

Russia has, on two separate occasions now, illegally invaded and annexed territory from two of it's neighbours to prevent these states from re-aligning themselves towards western powers.

In 2008, Russian backed separatists armed and supported by the Russian military seized land in the [Abkhazia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abkhazia) and [South Ossetia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Ossetia) regions of Georgia in response to the Georgian governments desire to seek closer ties with NATO and the EU. [\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War) [\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia%E2%80%93NATO_relations)

Following this, in 2014 - after the [Euromaidan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromaidan) protests overthrew the Ukranian government of pro-Moscow President [Viktor Yanukovych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Yanukovych) and Ukraine itself signalled it's intentions to join NATO [\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine%E2%80%93NATO_relations), Russian military units, devoid of their insignia and other identifying marks [\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_green_men_(Ukrainian_crisis)), illegally entered Ukranian territory and seized both the Crimean peninsula (with it's vital warm water naval port in Sevastopol [\[7\]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/07/ukraine-russia-crimea-naval-base-tatars-explainer)) and regions of Eastern Ukraine. The Russian government vehemently denied at the time that these were Russian troops [\[8\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/putin-denies-russian-troops-are-in-ukraine-decrees-certain-deaths-secret/2015/05/28/9bb15092-0543-11e5-93f4-f24d4af7f97d_story.html), though Crimea itself has now been directly annexed into the Russian federation [\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation) \- and the territories in Eastern Ukraine now form the basis for the entirely fictional state of Novorossiya or ""New Russia"". [\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novorossiya_(confederation))

Both times, the Russian government claimed it's actions were an attempt to protect Russian speaking minorities in each of these countries [\[11\]](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-ethnic-russification-baltics-kazakhstan-soviet/25328281.html) and it has used this pretence to support it's claims in other regions too, notably in the Baltic states (where large numbers of Russian speakers reside) and Eastern Poland. The difference between Georgia/Ukraine and the Baltic states/Poland is that the latter, are fully fledged NATO members. Putin himself has nonetheless, privately expressed a desire to see these territories re-integrated. [\[12\]](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11106195/Putin-privately-threatened-to-invade-Poland-Romania-and-the-Baltic-states.html)

As well as their direct military interventions in non-NATO countries, Russia has for many years now engaged in military posturing and provocation against NATO. Frequently violating air and naval zones in so called [""buzzings""](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/russia-testing-nato-the-skies-21621) and conducting the largest military exercises in European history along it's western borders. Exercises that far exceed in size those conducted by NATO itself. [\[13\]](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/the-nato-russia-exercise-gap/)

The message is relatively clear. Russia is both capable of using - and fully prepared to use military force to reclaim territory or influence lost following the collapse of the Soviet Union and has invested considerably in the modernisation of it's conventional and nuclear forces to enable it to. [\[14\]](https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/2019-04-04-Dick.pdf)

In addition to the conventional military threat posed by Russia, their exists a more sinister and omnious threat to western interests through the willingness of the Russian government to use dangerous and prohibited substances to assassinate targets both at home and abroad.

In 2006, prominent critic of the Russian government and of Putin in particular, [Alexander Litvinenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Litvinenko) was murdered in London after consuming tea laced with [Polonium-210](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonium-210) a radioactive element that left a hazardous trail of material all over the English capital [\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexander_Litvinenko#Polonium_trails). 12 years later in 2018, former Russian spy now living in exile in the UK, [Sergei Skripal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Skripal) was himself targeted for assassination through the use of [Novichok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novichok_agent), a binary chemical weapon and nerve agent that once more left a hazardous trail around the town of Salisbury, UK which resulted in the poisoning of both Skripal and his daughter, two police officers who attended the crime scene and a further two individuals who found the discarded perfume bottle used to spray Novichok over the front door of Skripal's house, one of whom would later tragically die as a result. [\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Sergei_and_Yulia_Skripal)

Both instances have been tied directly to agents of the Russian GRU intelligence agency acting on orders from the highest levels of the Russian government. [\[17\]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/493860/The-Litvinenko-Inquiry-H-C-695-web.pdf) [\[18\]](https://www.bellingcat.com/tag/skripal/) [\[19\]](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/10/09/full-report-skripal-poisoning-suspect-dr-alexander-mishkin-hero-russia/)

Both are also nothing short of acts of Nuclear, Biological or Chemical (NBC) terrorism against a NATO member state.

As a result, heavy sanctions were placed upon members of the Russian government [\[20\]](https://www.rferl.org/a/u-s-state-department-details-new-skripal-related-sanctions-on-russia/30090270.html), their diplomats were expelled from many western nations [\[21\]](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/26/four-eu-states-set-to-expel-russian-diplomats-over-skripal-attack) and their seat as a permanent member of the G8 (Now G7) was stripped from them [\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Eight#Russia%E2%80%B2s_participation_suspension_(2014)).

Finally, over the course of the past decade, the Russian government has engaged in numerous, co-ordinated campaigns of disinformation against Western nations. These campaigns were characterised by General Philip Breedlove, the former NATO military commander as; ***""the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.""*** [\[23\]](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/).

This has frequently been downplayed by many, specifically American conservatives who see it as an attempt to de-legitimise the President and cast doubt on the results of the 2016 election, but also by the wider public who mistakenly believe that it is limited to ""a few Russian bots on Facebook posting memes"".

The actions the Russian government are engaged in, to undermine western institutions and sow discord among the general public, are complex and multi-faceted [\[24\]](https://globalsecurityreview.com/cold-war-2-0-russian-information-warfare/). To label them as simple ""election interference"" risks severely underestimating the gravity of the situation.

Russia is waging an information war, one that seeks to take advantage of what many have termed the ""Post-truth age"". Beyond simply seeking to interfere in Western elections, the techniques perfected by the GRU have sought to promote Russian geo-political interests and goals at home and abroad as well as to augment it's military capabilities on the battlefield. [\[25\]](https://www.rand.org/blog/2017/07/russian-information-warfare-a-reality-that-needs-a.html)

These attempts have been extensively documented [\[26\]](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf) [\[27\]](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/news/view/1490533-scale-of-russian-interference-in-european-democracy-revealed) [\[28\]](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/news/view/1037714-russian-influence-and-interference-measures-following-the-2017-uk-terrorist-attacks) [\[29\]](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/1791/179109.htm) and nowhere was the propaganda machine more evident than during the investigation into the downing of flight MH17 over Ukraine, when state sponsored news networks and influence groups like the [Internet Research Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency) went into overdrive to present numerous outlandish conspiracy theories about the event [\[30\]](https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/13/russias-reality-trolls-and-the-mh17-war-of-misinformation-buk-missile/), none of which were designed to convince, but rather to muddy the water enough so as to cast some level of doubt on to the official findings of the investigation which would directly link [\[31\]](https://www.bellingcat.com/tag/mh17/) Pro-Russian rebels using weaponry directly controlled by the Russian military to the attack.

...

**The TL;DR:** of all this, is that although China poses a long-term concern to US and western hegemony, their immediate military and geopolitical risk is less than that posed by Russia, rather, their threats should be seen in more of a geo-economic sense and thus unlikely to bring it into direct military confrontation with NATO.

This argument was well surmised by a recent paper published by the RAND corporation which explored this subject and drew similar conclusions. I'll link to this below if you're interested on reading further.

e8ryzz,Whats the cultural and political link between Russia and Bulgaria?,"i recently got interested in the nation of bulgaria. Particularly because it is an oddity. It sits below romania, it borders serbia to the west and turkey to the south, and the black sea to the east. 

The oddity begins however when you look into its language and culture.

Bulgaria has a very similar language to russia, names  like boris, alexei etx. Cities ending in -pov. -iev. The same alphabet (cyrillic). It also has a very similar flag (its the russian flag scheme with differing colors). All these similarities would make sense if it was a former soviet country and it were close to russia. But its not. The nation above it, romania uses the latin alphabet and has a latin based language, more akin to italian than any slavic language. The nation to the south, turkey uses the latin alphabet and speaks a turik based language. The only kinda similar nation is Serbia, but they are very different in language and culture to bulgaria. Those are the reasons that lead me to believe this is an odd nation.

By Expand I mean : opening new abroad military bases.

It was interesting to see Russia opening several big bases in Syria. But besides Syria and Ukraine, from your opinion : What will be the possible next ones, based on current events ?

I think its priority can be in the Mideterranean, which can give a strategic advantage to Russia: its regionally close to it, and as it have bases in Syria, those combined can push to balance with the US in that region.

There are several options there: One will be Algeria, and the other may be Libya. However, both are complex situations : In Libya there are many competing factions, and Algeria seems not enthusiast about global rivarly, but this can change with the upcoming government.

dnbx0c,"If Ukraine and Russia manage to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine, would it untie Russia’s hands and cause increased threat in other Russian neighbouring regions?","At the moment one gets the impression that the conflict in Ukraine has Russia bogged down, militarily tied and isolated. If a peace deal is successful, it will only be a matter of time until Russia returns to various institutions it was kicked out from and most likely sanctions would be stopped. Does this have a potential to increase possible threat of Russian military intervention elsewhere in neighbouring regions? For example it is extremely unlikely that Russia would act militarily in some hypothetical scenario in Georgia, but after a peace deal with Ukraine Russias hands will be untied and in case of some tensions Russia could assert its interests militarily.

e6l4wy,Do you think that the European Unions slow walking of Turkeys ascension might lead it to seriously reconsider the Russian-made Eurasian Economic Union?,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Economic_Union#Enlargement

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union

So, it's not *just* the perception that the EU is dragging their feet on admitting Turkey, but also Turkey has backslid on the Human Rights and Democracy angle that the EU wants to enshrine right? So Turkey is partly to blame at its own ~~slow process~~ suspension of accession. Also in conjunction with things like the F-35/S-400 controversy, Syria and Iran and other geopolitical aspects that have shoved a wedge between Turkey and the West. 

But to the North we see also Ukraine, which was split in two by the pro-EU and Pro-Russia factions. I do not think Turkey would get split in half the same way, I think that eventually Turkish leaders could see the EAEU as either a stick to shake at the EU to hurry things up (or even drop the requirements holding it back?) **or** as an actual path forward to some prosperity (if the EU is just going to tease them forever). 

I think I understand in *general* that being part of the EU would be better for Turkish *economically* and the EAEU would be a step below that. I think that the EAEU would be more welcoming to Turkey despite its leaders authoritarian tendencies though. 

Is this a realistic scenario, that Turkey gives up on being part of the EU and joins the EAEU to spite the West, get at least some trade deals working out? 

How would it affect the Chinese Belt-and-Road Initiative if Turkey takes a more Asian-centered trade approach? Would it be a boost to the B&R or is there some downside I'm not seeing?",Sachyriel,geopolitics,22,18,1575569864,/r/geopolitics/comments/e6l4wy/do_you_think_that_the_european_unions_slow/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/e6l4wy/do_you_think_that_the_european_unions_slow/,post_hanoi,russia,2025-12-12 17:32:42

dlpmfd,Turkey to use Russian Federation banking system for international settlements,"During the joint communique regarding Syria ([YouTube of live broadcast beginning around 3:30](https://youtu.be/rR7NO0YsX-0)), both leaders announced that Turkey and Russian Federation businesses can now trade directly with each other in their respective currencies using the Russian international clearances system. In other words, Turkey won’t need to expose itself to the US financial system and the sanctions that hook on to it.

Presumably this is a move that goes toward insulating the Turkish economy from the economic catastrophe the US have promised to inflict on Turkey.  It may well be that this was the key enticement that Russia offered in order to get Turkey’s agreement regarding Syria.

In the face of sanctions, Turkey will now look toward Russia for financial stability and long term business, and thus Turkey will more quickly move away from the West and toward the Russian sphere of influence.",ShootingPains,geopolitics,77,28,1571783050,/r/geopolitics/comments/dlpmfd/turkey_to_use_russian_federation_banking_system/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/dlpmfd/turkey_to_use_russian_federation_banking_system/,post_hanoi,russia,2025-12-12 17:32:42

cqilfl,"In Nuclear Fear Today, Or how the Russian rocket 9M729 scared Washington","  

**I**n

**N**uclear

**F**ear

**T**oday, Or how the Russian rocket 9M729 scared Washington

General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee Mikhail Gorbachev and US President Ronald Reagan signed the INF Treaty on December 8, 1987 in Washington. It entered into force on June 1, 1988. By June 1991, the treaty was fully implemented. The USSR decommissioned twice as many missiles as the United States did (1846 and 846), almost three times as many launchers (825 and 289), and almost seven times as many missile bases than USA(69 and 9).

On October 20, 2018, US President Donald Trump announced the intention of the United States to withdraw from the treaty allegedly because of ""non-compliance with its terms of the Russian side."" According to the United States, the agreement violates the tests of the Russian 9M729 missile, which has a flight range of over 500 km. Washington delivered an ultimatum to Russia that it would begin the process of withdrawing from the agreement on February 2, 2019, if Russia does not destroy the 9M729 missile. At the briefing, the head of the Missile Forces and Artillery of the Armed Forces of Russia Mikhail Matveevsky revealed the performance characteristics of the missile and stated that it could not be refueled with the amount of fuel that would be enough for a flight of 500 km or more. He explained that such missiles are equipped with a warhead and refuel only in the factory. And they are delivered to the troops in special containers. Thus, changing the mass of fuel and refueling the rocket is impossible. However, US representatives did not appear at the briefing and were not satisfied with its results.

At the same time, Russia has counterclaims to the United States related to the implementation of the INF Treaty. In particular, this concerns the use of missile defense targets (Hera, LRALT and MRT), which are similar in characteristics to intermediate and shorter-range missiles (the United States qualifies them as ground-to-air cash register treaties, the Russian experts believe that under the guise of these launches, the development of technologies for the production and use of forbidden-range missiles is underway).

In response to the US unilateral withdrawal from the treaty, the Russian side stated that it was not refusing unilateral obligations to comply with the treaty. However, Moscow will not deploy the short- and intermediate- range missiles where there are no such American-made missiles. The development, production and deployment of ground-based missiles will be reciprocal and mirror-like. The Russian Foreign Ministry believes that the Americans were only looking for a reason to withdraw from the treaty, because this hides their intentions to deploy weapons in the space. And it’s not surprising, because the United States themself “quite freely interpret the essence of contractual obligations where this prevents the creation of weapons that are important to them.”",Professional_Trust,geopolitics,19,8,1565829563,/r/geopolitics/comments/cqilfl/in_nuclear_fear_today_or_how_the_russian_rocket/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/cqilfl/in_nuclear_fear_today_or_how_the_russian_rocket/,post_hanoi,russia,2025-12-12 17:32:42

&#x200B;

We have seen many articles and opinions about Nord Stream 2. This is pretty good story about Russian pipelines and the fact Russia needed/wanted to bypass Ukraine and Belarus for clear reasons.

Why should Americans or someone else discuss European pipelines, people talk about geopolitical tool of Kremlin, but truth is Russia needs revenue from selling natural gas and good relations with Germany and most EU countries. Around 40% of Russian foreign trade is with EU. Considering new pipelines, North Sea production decline in near future and new LNG export capabilities in Russia their market share should be as high as ever and we should really see this as economic interpendence between Russia and the EU. Look at that contaminated oil Russia delivered few months ago ( now paying and promising compensations ), it was huge embarrassment for Russian government, they want to be seen as reliable partner.",romismak,geopolitics,15,5,1577572335,/r/geopolitics/comments/egxcsi/putins_grand_gas_project_makes_sense_now/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/egxcsi/putins_grand_gas_project_makes_sense_now/,post_hanoi,russia,2025-12-12 17:32:42

ctdjqj,If Russia decides to end the Ukranian conflict for readmittance into the G7 what would be the terms? also how would they try to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO?,"Ukraine has elected a new president whose goal is to end the ongoing civil war, and Emanuel Macron just had a meeting with Putin, before the G7 summit, where he stipulated that for Russia to rejoin the G7 the Ukraine conflict must end. For the war to end, Russia will likely feel the need to ensure Ukraine doesn't enter NATO. How will they do this?

I know Crimea is settled in Russias minds, it is part of Russia. Other things they stipulate are; Federalization of the Donbas; Freedom from prosecution of war crimes for their rebel forces. They would probably also require things that protect Ethnic Russians, like recognition of the Russian language as one of the national languages, and allow it to be spoken in public schools.

What other stipulations would they add, and how would they achieve this main goal of preventing Ukraine from joining NATO? Would federalization prevent this? If so, how?

I'm sure some people will say it's impossible to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, or say Russia won't end the conflict, and those are valid points but they don't answer the question I am asking.",ByronCole77,geopolitics,5,13,1566373533,/r/geopolitics/comments/ctdjqj/if_russia_decides_to_end_the_ukranian_conflict/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ctdjqj/if_russia_decides_to_end_the_ukranian_conflict/,post_hanoi,russia,2025-12-12 17:32:42

df4ajf,Megathread: Senate Intel Report Finds Kremlin Directed Russian Social Media Meddling In 2016,"The Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday released its report on Russian social media interference efforts during the 2016 elections, with the panel finding that Russian actors were directed by the Kremlin to help President Trump win the election.

The report is the second volume to be released as part of the committee’s investigation into Russian interference efforts in the lead-up to the 2016 elections, with its findings mirroring those of former special counsel Robert Mueller in his own report released earlier this year.

Context: Hillary Clinton [insinuated](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/18/politics/hillary-clinton-tulsi-gabbard/index.html) that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian asset. There have been insinuations she is supported by [Russian bots](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/18/hillary-clinton-hints-russia-is-grooming-tulsi-gabbard-as-third-party-candidate), and is an [apologist](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/tulsi-gabbards-syria-record-shows-why-she-cant-be-president/2019/08/01/f804c790-b497-11e9-8949-5f36ff92706e_story.html) for Syria's Basher al-Assad.

What evidence has there been so far that may support or debunk such a claim?
