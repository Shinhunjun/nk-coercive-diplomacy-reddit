The Internet has been effectively turned off (traffic is under 9% of the normal amounts).

Credible news organisations are quoting rumours that Iranian airlines are on standby to evacuate the countries leaders and their families.

And now the women are revolting over the forced wearing of the Hijab.  (Male) leaders are calling for a referendum on the issue but the women don't seem to want the men to have a say in it.

It looks to me like Iran is in a much better condition than the US for diplomatic negotiations. Following the removal of the Iran deal, most major nations have ignored America's sanctions and maintained trade with them, therefore undermining US leverage. If that's the case, could the Trump administration intentionally or unintentionally setting up the stage for Iran to have stronger leverage in future diplomatic talks?

d5java,"Upcoming interview with a former chief foreign correspondent to talk all things Iran, North Korea, and Middle East conflict. Looking for community questions.","Hi Everyone,

 I am the host of the All Things Interesting podcast and will be interviewing Jay Solomon, a former chief foreign correspondent for the WSJ who has covered both national security and U.S. foreign policy. He is an expert on Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programs and weapons proliferation networks in the Middle East. He has also written multiple books on the geopolitics and covert wars within the region.
 
With the recent events in Saudi Arabia this past week, I wanted to reach out to the community to gather questions you all might have as it relates to the current Middle East conflicts, nuclear proliferation, North Korea and Iranian nuclear weapons development, Middle East links to the North Korean military system, and foreign policy/national security in general.
 
I look forward to hearing everyone's questions and to sharing the episode once it's available.
