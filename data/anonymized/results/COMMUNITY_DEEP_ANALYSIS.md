## 5. Summary for Paper Inclusion

### Key Observations

1. **Pre-Singapore (P1)**: Community discourse dominated by **threat-oriented themes**
   - Top communities titled as "Nuclear Pariah State", "Aggressive Military Posture"
   - Key findings focus on: Nuclear arsenal as deterrent, UN sanctions, Missile tests
   - High frequency of: "military" (252), "nuclear" (203), "geopolitical" (92)

2. **Singapore-Hanoi (P2)**: Clear shift towards **diplomatic engagement**
   - New keywords emerge: "efforts", "ongoing", "states", "united"
   - Key findings include: **"Denuclearization Talks"**, Role of United Nations
   - "diplomatic" rises in prominence (67→62 relative increase)

3. **Post-Hanoi (P3)**: **Partial reversion** with maintained diplomatic framing
   - "trump" (33) emerges as top keyword (not in P1/P2 top 15)
   - "political" (30) appears newly → more political/leadership focus
   - Key findings: "Ongoing Nuclear Talks", "Tensions with the United States"
   - Communities still reference "International Relations" not just "Pariah State"

### Evidence Supporting Asymmetric Ratchet Effect

| Indicator | P1 → P2 Change | P2 → P3 Change | Net P1→P3 |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| Community Titles | "Pariah State" → "International Security Dynamics" | Maintains "International Relations" framing | **Diplomatic gain retained** |
| New Keywords | +efforts, ongoing | +trump, political | **Leadership-focused discourse** |
| Key Findings | Emphasized deterrence/sanctions | Introduced "Denuclearization Talks" | **Talks persist as topic** |

### Quantitative Summary

| Metric | P1 | P2 | P3 |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|
| Total Communities | 354 | 153 | 107 |
| "diplomatic" keyword frequency | 96 | 62 | 44 |
| "diplomatic" rank | 10th | 6th | **6th** (maintained) |

**Conclusion**: The Singapore Summit (P1→P2) introduced diplomatic framing ("efforts", "denuclearization talks") that persisted after the Hanoi failure (P3), supporting the asymmetric ratchet hypothesis. While some threat framing returned, the discourse did not fully revert to P1's "pariah state" characterization.
