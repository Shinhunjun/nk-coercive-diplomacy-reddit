## 2. Transition Analysis

### Singapore Summit Effect (P1 → P2)

| Metric | Before | After | **Change** |
|--------|--------|-------|------------|
| Threat % | 61.5% | 42.4% | **-19.0%** |
| Peace % | 7.8% | 24.7% | **+16.9%** |

### Hanoi Summit Failure (P2 → P3)

| Metric | Before | After | **Change** |
|--------|--------|-------|------------|
| Threat % | 42.4% | 40.9% | **-1.5%** |
| Peace % | 24.7% | 18.6% | **-6.1%** |

---

## 3. Key Findings

### Asymmetric/Ratchet Effect

1. **Singapore Summit Impact (P1→P2)**:
   - Threat framing decreased significantly
   - Peace/diplomacy framing increased substantially

2. **Hanoi Failure Impact (P2→P3)**:
   - Threat framing remained stable (did NOT return to P1 levels)
   - Peace framing decreased partially but did NOT fully revert

3. **Net Effect (P1→P3)**:
   - Structural changes from Singapore Summit **persisted** despite Hanoi failure
   - Supports the asymmetric "ratchet" effect hypothesis

- **DENUCLEARIZATION** emerged as a central concept in P2
- **Kim Jong Un** increased in relative importance

### 7.3 Framing Transition
- **Threat framing decreased** significantly (P1→P2: -19%)
- **Peace framing increased** (P1→P2: +17%)
- Hanoi failure caused **partial reversion** but not full reversal

### 7.4 Asymmetric Ratchet Effect
- Singapore Summit produced large structural changes
- Hanoi failure produced smaller counter-changes
- **Net effect**: Diplomatic framing persisted
