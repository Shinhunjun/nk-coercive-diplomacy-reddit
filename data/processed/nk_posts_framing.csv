http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/defense/326094-how-north-korea-could-kill-up-to-90-percent-of-americans-at-any

The article's thrust is that North Korea is:

1. Capable of miniaturizing a nuclear warhead
2. Capable of creating an ICBM to deliver that warhead
3. Able to combine those capabilities to create an EMP shock that knocks out the national powergrid

Furthermore the article cites the Congressional EMP commission's [report](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110hhrg45133/pdf/CHRG-110hhrg45133.pdf) that theorizes  the ensuing chaos could *kill 9 in 10 Americans*.

My initial reaction is that the conclusions seem wildly exaggerated, but the author of the editorial is chief of staff of said EMP commission and I certainly don't have detailed knowledge on this question.

So, two questions:

1. How accurate are the authors assessments of North Korea's nuclear capabilities?
2.

On this sub, and reddit overall, some threads have popped up asking why North Korea wants nukes or why they're so crazy or why they hate the US so much (or something like that). 

I thought I'd give my two cents on this matter as well. While reading this, please keep in mind that I don't have any sympathy for North Korea and obviously have no desire for them to acquire nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles and also view much of their actions as destabilizing, but to get to the core of the matter we need to treat North Korea's actions and beliefs in a detached manner.

--------------------------------

Much of the discussion have revolved around what can be done to prevent NK from getting nukes, short of military force. US exercises of deterrence and Chinese influence and sanctions are often cited along the lines of what may help to prevent NK from testing a nuke or a missile and keep fatty Kim from being too crazy, and eventually to get NK to abandon their nuclear ambitions overall one day, peacefully.

Unfortunately, I believe such a prospect is unlikely, if we take a step back and consider why North Korea actually wants nukes. 

Is it because North Korea wants to have the ability to strike the US or Japan because Kim and his associates have brain washed themselves into hating them? Is it because North Korea wants nukes to hold the world to nuclear ransom? Is it because North Korea wants to have some way of taking over South Korea? 

I think all of those are possible, but in the eyes of Kim, I believe those are all vastly smaller secondary reasons compared to the primary reason, which I think most media and geopolitical discourse does not sufficiently cover.

And I believe that reason is self preservation. Fear. 

During the Cold War, prior to the USSR's dissolution, NK was effectively under the protection of the USSR, not only economically but to a degree militarily. NK knew it's survival was partly guaranteed by the strength of the USSR-US geopolitical struggle.

But between the early 1990s to the 2000s, two significant geopolitical events occurred, related to NK's self perceived security.

* First was the significant dissolution of NK's sense of diplomatic and geopolitical support and security, due to the dissolution of the USSR (though the USSR had begun to wind down their relationship with NK by the late Cold War anyway), but also due to China's significant economic re-orientation and integration with the rest of the world, leaving NK very diplomatically and geopolitically isolated. In the span of under a decade, NK realized it was basically alone, facing an economically and technologically powerful South Korea with the backing and support of the US, not to mention other allies like Japan, and even more distant countries like Australia, UK and New Zealand. 

* Secondly, was the US and the west's wielding of significant military power to conduct interventions, invasions, and regime change in a number of nations in the post Cold War era. The 2003 invasion of Iraq being probably one of the most primary examples, but the first Gulf War and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and the subsequent events in that country probably shook NK's government and then Kim Jong Il quite substantially. More recent events like the coalition against Libya, and the US stance towards countries like Iran have probably caused such a fear to take a more permanent hold of the younger, current Kim. 

I believe that those two changes put together, along with the many decade long mutual animosity between NK with the US+SK, created a sense of significant fear in the Kim government that they would effectively be ""next"". Being listed on GWB's modern ""axis of evil"" in 2002 definitely did not help their sense of security. 

I believe the Kim government believed their only way of attaining security for themselves that they could guarantee for themselves, against a foe far more powerful than themselves -- i.e.: the US -- was by having nukes.

What resulted from 2006 when NK conducted its first nuclear test, was a self feeding circle where the US and its allies in SK and Japan have conducted very significant military exercises on or near the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea provocations whether they are nuclear tests or missile tests, or things like sinking a SK corvette or shelling a SK village. NK in turn views those exercises as dress rehearsals for decapitation strikes against Kim and his cronies as well as regime change against NK akin to what the US has done quite successfully in quite a number of times over the last few decades around the world, thus further accelerating their nuclear ambitions.

The key take away, I think, is that NK and Kim likely sees their nukes and the ability to launch them to the continental US as a vital requirement for their very survival. No one wants them to get nukes, whether it's the US, China, SK, Japan, Russia, or whomever. But NK really, really, really wants them and from their point of view they need them to survive.

From there, I think it becomes obvious to see why the current policy vectors of the US and China will not stop NK's goal for nukes. 

* For the US, the primary policy to NK's nukes is basically via high profile military displays with allies. Sanctions, whether it's from US and its allies or via UN have little to no effect anymore, so the last card to repeatedly play is via military actions to deter NK from acting up too much and to try to dissuade NK from further nuclear testing. Of course, there have been reports that the US have been using cyber warfare to sabotage NK's missile tests, and I consider that to be very likely and credible. But none of these actions produce a policy that are able to dissuade NK from developing nukes, and if anything they are likely to further strengthen Kim's siege mentality and strengthen their determination to develop nukes. Cyber warfare will put NK's missiles back years and years, but they will likely get there eventually, because their resolve will remain due to their fundamental fear for their own survival.

* For China, it's a bit more complicated because obviously everyone knows not only China's actions are limited due to the risk of a NK collapse causing a flood of refugees into its borders, but also because China fears the geopolitical consequence of a NK collapse where they may lose a vital buffer against the US allied South Korea and may end up facing US ground forces across the Yalu, which of course was the whole reason why China got into the original Korean War to begin with. But, on top of all of that, I believe even if China further cracked down on trade with North Korea and applying political pressure North Korea as the US and Trump has wished, that would not produce the desired result of getting NK to stop its nuclear and missile programmes, partly because China already lacks any substantial political influence over NK since about the late 2000s, but also because it would further show them that China cannot be counted on as even a vague security guarantee and they would seek nukes even more to guarantee their own survival against the US. A very real possibility that China needs to face as well, is if China economically punishes NK too much then NK may end up even pointing a few of its nukes towards China as well if they feel China has turned on them. 

-----------------------------------

So, I think a peaceful resolution to North Korea's nuclear ambitions is very unlikely. That's because the primary fundamental rationale behind NK's nuclear ambition is to preserve its own survival due to their perception of existential threat from the US -- their requirement for nukes is to achieve one of deterrence (though I admit using that word for North Korea who seem so cartoonishly evil and unstable is a little bit strange to type). 

The only way for NK to relinquish its nukes willingly and peacefully, in my opinion, is if there were some sort of grand bargain where NK is 110% sure that the US would not threaten them and more importantly if NK did not perceive the US would **ever** be a threat to them.

But obviously such an arrangement is geopolitically ridiculous, as the North's requirements for such an arrangement will obviously not be acceptable to the US for a whole multitude of reasons and likely involve substantial reduction if not total withdrawal of US forces in Northeast Asia if not the whole of East Asia, and even then it probably would not be enough for NK because they would see the US's ability to easily redeploy back into theatre via naval and airlift as a big threat. The US, for its part, would rightly see any such action as giving up on allies like SK and Japan, as well as opening SK up to attack by the North, and may likely feel NK won't hold its end of the bargain, not to mention the associated loss of geopolitical influence in a key region which its military assets there help to provide, US geopolitical credibility worldwide etc, and the list just goes on and on.

(And to be frank, the very notion of NK and the US sitting down at the table with each other as anything like equals is likely anathema to anyone and everyone in the US government.)

Anyway, these are my thoughts on the matter. A few of the details here or there might be challenged or debatable, but I believe the fundamental premise of NK's requirement for nukes (survival/sense of existential threat from the US), and the conclusion derived from that premise (current US and China policy vectors being ineffective in both the short term and long term) as being sound and stable.","So, we all know what's been happening with North Korea in the last few days, and the statements which the US and China have been making on the matter.

Is it because North Korea wants nukes to hold the world to nuclear ransom? Is it because North Korea wants to have some way of taking over South Korea? I think all of those are possible, but in the eyes of Kim, I believe those are all vastly smaller secondary reasons compared to the primary reason, which I think most media and geopolitical discourse does not sufficiently cover. And I believe that reason is self preservation. Fear. During the Cold War, prior to the USSR's dissolution, NK was effectively under the protection of the USSR, not only economically but to a degree militarily. NK knew it's survival was partly guaranteed by the strength of the USSR-US geopolitical struggle. But between the early 1990s to the 2000s, two significant geopolitical events occurred, related to NK's self perceived security. First was the significant dissolution of NK's sense of diplomatic and geopolitical support and security, due to the dissolution of the USSR though the USSR had begun to wind down their relationship with NK by the late Cold War anyway , but also due to China's significant economic re-orientation and integration with the rest of the world, leaving NK very diplomatically and geopolitically isolated. In the span of under a decade, NK realized it was basically alone, facing an economically and technologically powerful South Korea with the backing and support of the US, not to mention other allies like Japan, and even more distant countries like Australia, UK and New Zealand. Secondly, was the US and the west's wielding of significant military power to conduct interventions, invasions, and regime change in a number of nations in the post Cold War era. The 2003 invasion of Iraq being probably one of the most primary examples, but the first Gulf War and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and the subsequent events in that country probably shook NK's government and then Kim Jong Il quite substantially. More recent events like the coalition against Libya, and the US stance towards countries like Iran have probably caused such a fear to take a more permanent hold of the younger, current Kim. I believe that those two changes put together, along with the many decade long mutual animosity between NK with the US SK, created a sense of significant fear in the Kim government that they would effectively be ""next"". Being listed on GWB's modern ""axis of evil"" in 2002 definitely did not help their sense of security. I believe the Kim government believed their only way of attaining security for themselves that they could guarantee for themselves, against a foe far more powerful than themselves -- i.e. the US -- was by having nukes. What resulted from 2006 when NK conducted its first nuclear test, was a self feeding circle where the US and its allies in SK and Japan have conducted very significant military exercises on or near the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea provocations whether they are nuclear tests or missile tests, or things like sinking a SK corvette or shelling a SK village. NK in turn views those exercises as dress rehearsals for decapitation strikes against Kim and his cronies as well as regime change against NK akin to what the US has done quite successfully in quite a number of times over the last few decades around the world, thus further accelerating their nuclear ambitions. The key take away, I think, is that NK and Kim likely sees their nukes and the ability to launch them to the continental US as a vital requirement for their very survival. No one wants them to get nukes, whether it's the US, China, SK, Japan, Russia, or whomever. But NK really, really, really wants them and from their point of view they need them to survive. From there, I think it becomes obvious to see why the current policy vectors of the US and China will not stop NK's goal for nukes. For the US, the primary policy to NK's nukes is basically via high profile military displays with allies. Sanctions, whether it's from US and its allies or via UN have little to no effect anymore, so the last card to repeatedly play is via military actions to deter NK from acting up too much and to try to dissuade NK from further nuclear testing. Of course, there have been reports that the US have been using cyber warfare to sabotage NK's missile tests, and I consider that to be very likely and credible. But none of these actions produce a policy that are able to dissuade NK from developing nukes, and if anything they are likely to further strengthen Kim's siege mentality and strengthen their determination to develop nukes. Cyber warfare will put NK's missiles back years and years, but they will likely get there eventually, because their resolve will remain due to their fundamental fear for their own survival. For China, it's a bit more complicated because obviously everyone knows not only China's actions are limited due to the risk of a NK collapse causing a flood of refugees into its borders, but also because China fears the geopolitical consequence of a NK collapse where they may lose a vital buffer against the US allied South Korea and may end up facing US ground forces across the Yalu, which of course was the whole reason why China got into the original Korean War to begin with. But, on top of all of that, I believe even if China further cracked down on trade with North Korea and applying political pressure North Korea as the US and Trump has wished, that would not produce the desired result of getting NK to stop its nuclear and missile programmes, partly because China already lacks any substantial political influence over NK since about the late 2000s, but also because it would further show them that China cannot be counted on as even a vague security guarantee and they would seek nukes even more to guarantee their own survival against the US. A very real possibility that China needs to face as well, is if China economically punishes NK too much then NK may end up even pointing a few of its nukes towards China as well if they feel China has turned on them. ----------------------------------- So, I think a peaceful resolution to North Korea's nuclear ambitions is very unlikely. That's because the primary fundamental rationale behind NK's nuclear ambition is to preserve its own survival due to their perception of existential threat from the US -- their requirement for nukes is to achieve one of deterrence though I admit using that word for North Korea who seem so cartoonishly evil and unstable is a little bit strange to type . The only way for NK to relinquish its nukes willingly and peacefully, in my opinion, is if there were some sort of grand bargain where NK is 110 sure that the US would not threaten them and more importantly if NK did not perceive the US would ever be a threat to them. But obviously such an arrangement is geopolitically ridiculous, as the North's requirements for such an arrangement will obviously not be acceptable to the US for a whole multitude of reasons and likely involve substantial reduction if not total withdrawal of US forces in Northeast Asia if not the whole of East Asia, and even then it probably would not be enough for NK because they would see the US's ability to easily redeploy back into theatre via naval and airlift as a big threat. The US, for its part, would rightly see any such action as giving up on allies like SK and Japan, as well as opening SK up to attack by the North, and may likely feel NK won't hold its end of the bargain, not to mention the associated loss of geopolitical influence in a key region which its military assets there help to provide, US geopolitical credibility worldwide etc, and the list just goes on and on. And to be frank, the very notion of NK and the US sitting down at the table with each other as anything like equals is likely anathema to anyone and everyone in the US government. Anyway, these are my thoughts on the matter. A few of the details here or there might be challenged or debatable, but I believe the fundamental premise of NK's requirement for nukes survival sense of existential threat from the US , and the conclusion derived from that premise current US and China policy vectors being ineffective in both the short term and long term as being sound and stable.","My thoughts on North Korea's nuclear ambitions and the limits of US and Chinese influence So, we all know what's been happening with North Korea in the last few days, and the statements which the US and China have been making on the matter.

During the Cold War, prior to the USSR's dissolution, NK was effectively under the protection of the USSR, not only economically but to a degree militarily. NK knew it's survival was partly guaranteed by the strength of the USSR-US geopolitical struggle.

But between the early 1990s to the 2000s, two significant geopolitical events occurred, related to NK's self perceived security.

* First was the significant dissolution of NK's sense of diplomatic and geopolitical support and security, due to the dissolution of the USSR (though the USSR had begun to wind down their relationship with NK by the late Cold War anyway), but also due to China's significant economic re-orientation and integration with the rest of the world, leaving NK very diplomatically and geopolitically isolated. In the span of under a decade, NK realized it was basically alone, facing an economically and technologically powerful South Korea with the backing and support of the US, not to mention other allies like Japan, and even more distant countries like Australia, UK and New Zealand. 

* Secondly, was the US and the west's wielding of significant military power to conduct interventions, invasions, and regime change in a number of nations in the post Cold War era. The 2003 invasion of Iraq being probably one of the most primary examples, but the first Gulf War and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and the subsequent events in that country probably shook NK's government and then Kim Jong Il quite substantially. More recent events like the coalition against Libya, and the US stance towards countries like Iran have probably caused such a fear to take a more permanent hold of the younger, current Kim. 

I believe that those two changes put together, along with the many decade long mutual animosity between NK with the US+SK, created a sense of significant fear in the Kim government that they would effectively be ""next"". Being listed on GWB's modern ""axis of evil"" in 2002 definitely did not help their sense of security.

On 1953 USA signed an armistice with the North Korea, but then broke it:

So my question is: USA still have bombs in South Korea? I know that South Korea doesn't have any, but does USA still have them inside their borders, threatening North Korea? 

And second if the answer is positive, wouldn't be a wise choice to propose a peace treaty and the end of the nuclear program (supervised by the UN) with the promise of taking them away from there? Because if this is true, actually justify the North Korean nuclear program from my point of view.","Hi, I'm trying to form the most possible objective opinion on the Korean problem.

1. Sit down with Trump and negotiate the terms to eliminate the US opposition to South Korea's nuclear weapons restrictions. 

2. Also negotiate to eliminate US restrictions on South Korea's right to research and development of cruise missile technology.

3. In return, as soon as South Korea develops their nuclear weapons, America withdraws its troops from South Korea.  

This is a win-win tradeoff for the two countries. South Korea saves money on spending on useless conventional weapons, and America saves $1 billion a year in the stationing of the USFK.

Furthermore, South Korea gets new independence to control its own foreign policy, and the US can now wash their hands off of their South Korean headache.  

This is why Trump is good for Korea. He is turning everything up-side-down, forcing countries and peoples to get rid of the current status quo in North Korea.  Trump may sound like a crazy crude madman, but one thing about him is that you can make deals with him which could be beneficial for both sides. 

What South Korea cannot do is depend on United States and expect that the US won't interfere with South Korean policies. And the US will demand more and more financially, that it will never end. There will be endless bickerings over who pays what. South Korea needs to stand up on its own and become a normal country with its own military controlled by its own nation.  

The US military leaving South Korea would be hard in the beginning, but it will also remove a whole load of headaches at the same time. For instance, North Korea cannot use the US military in Korea as an excuse to be so belligerent. China will also become far less patient with North Korea's belligerence. And there will be no reason for North Korea to threaten the US with nuclear annihilation. This will dial down the animosity in East Asia.  World accepting and recognizing the nuclear status for both North and South Korea's, this region will become safer. ","This is what I would do if I was Moon Jae-in 1.

6yg3vu,What would happen if the US simply welcomed North Korea to the table as a nuclear power?,What would happen if the US simply welcomed North Korea to the table as a nuclear power?,"All of the discussion I have seen on North Korea's nuclear capabilities seems to focus on the fact that Kim cannot be disarmed by diplomacy, sanctions, nor military action.  Even if China and Russia were 100% aligned with the US/Japan/South Korea (ie, setting aside the diplomatic implications of any action taken by the US and Allies) we still have the following issues:

1.  Kim's conventional threat against Seoul that makes any military action produce unacceptable civilian losses.  The nuclear threat greatly compounds this, (assuming sufficient intelligence does not exist to reliably knock that capability out prior to its use).

2.  Kim has demonstrated an unwillingness to use his nuclear program as a bargaining chip.  There is no indication that either sanctions or incentives will induce a voluntary disarmament.

The one option I have not seen discussed is to simply stop trying to take the weapons away, and possibly to attempt some kind of appeasement.  Admit defeat, basically, before someone gets nuked.

We already have a sort of mutually assured destruction in place. Kim can't successfully invade the south, and he can't nuke anyone without being completely destroyed.  It seems that pushing him to an act of desperation is the worst possible course of action.

Also, now that Kim has nuclear tipped ICBM's, the damage has been done.  The US has very little to lose from a technology transfer standpoint.  This should actually make it easier to provide material aid to North Korea, since the potential for harm by military appropriation of any industrial equipment is less now.  We could provide a massive aid package under the guise of ""paying tribute"" and let Kim take credit for providing the material wealth to his people.

It would not be that expensive for the superpowers to make North Korea wealthy.  Kim's regime seems uniquely resistant to revolution caused by deprivation, but it remains to be seen if it would be stable under conditions of prosperity.  Prosperity would also remove the massive wealth disparity between North and South as a blocker to reunification (leaving only Kim's desire rule...which is still a deal breaker, but a separate issue).

What do you think?  This is probably a crazy approach, but since I have never seen it seriously discussed I am curious what the consequences might be.","All of the discussion I have seen on North Korea's nuclear capabilities seems to focus on the fact that Kim cannot be disarmed by diplomacy, sanctions, nor military action.

All of the discussion I have seen on North Korea's nuclear capabilities seems to focus on the fact that Kim cannot be disarmed by diplomacy, sanctions, nor military action. Even if China and Russia were 100 aligned with the US Japan South Korea ie, setting aside the diplomatic implications of any action taken by the US and Allies we still have the following issues 1. Kim's conventional threat against Seoul that makes any military action produce unacceptable civilian losses. The nuclear threat greatly compounds this, assuming sufficient intelligence does not exist to reliably knock that capability out prior to its use . 2. Kim has demonstrated an unwillingness to use his nuclear program as a bargaining chip. There is no indication that either sanctions or incentives will induce a voluntary disarmament. The one option I have not seen discussed is to simply stop trying to take the weapons away, and possibly to attempt some kind of appeasement. Admit defeat, basically, before someone gets nuked. We already have a sort of mutually assured destruction in place. Kim can't successfully invade the south, and he can't nuke anyone without being completely destroyed. It seems that pushing him to an act of desperation is the worst possible course of action. Also, now that Kim has nuclear tipped ICBM's, the damage has been done. The US has very little to lose from a technology transfer standpoint. This should actually make it easier to provide material aid to North Korea, since the potential for harm by military appropriation of any industrial equipment is less now. We could provide a massive aid package under the guise of ""paying tribute"" and let Kim take credit for providing the material wealth to his people. It would not be that expensive for the superpowers to make North Korea wealthy. Kim's regime seems uniquely resistant to revolution caused by deprivation, but it remains to be seen if it would be stable under conditions of prosperity. Prosperity would also remove the massive wealth disparity between North and South as a blocker to reunification leaving only Kim's desire rule...which is still a deal breaker, but a separate issue .

717hd9,"[Discussion] Korean nationalists strongly oppose a war, but perhaps a military action is better for the people.","Discussion Korean nationalists strongly oppose a war, but perhaps a military action is better for the people.","This is my opinion based on what I have heard. It could be right or it could be wrong. I am not claiming everyone should agree on what I say; I am just telling what I think.

I do not think I am a Korean nationalist. Frankly, I do not really mind whether it exists or not. I am not completely on the left (progressive, young people) or on the right (conservative, old people). For some issues, I agree with the left, for some, I agree with the right.

Koreans have been educated to become nationalists. They were told that Koreans are one pure race, who are very smart and peaceful, who invented world's first printing system and whatnot, civilised the barbarous Japanese, and ruled the large land of Manchuria. They kept being told that the two Koreas must be united, because they are one race.

So, as I assess, most young people are on the left and quite frankly nationalists. They are rather soft to North Korea. They say South Korea must aid the poor starving North Koreans as they are 'one race', and remain peaceful with the NK government by gratifying their requests. They condemn those 'righties' and the US who criticise North Korea. They think by having a nice relationship with NK, someday the two Koreas will be united peacefully without blood.

But will it be so? I am very sceptical about peaceful unification. Now that the NK regime has powerful weapons, I find no reason why the king of North Korea would give up his privilege peacefully, unless he would be the new king of the united Korea.

As I have said, I am not a nationalist, so I do not particularly prefer Korean people over people from other nations. I do not want a war on the Korean peninsula, because I have literally nothing to gain, and only things to lose. But if they are nationalists, shouldn't they risk a war to liberate NK despite the damage, to help those suffering 'one race'?

I have just read an article about a defector. She described what she saw as a teenager; pretty classmates were taken as sexual servants, people were blasted into pieces for the allegation of making pornography. And there are lots of other horrible stories. They may not be 100% true, but there should be no doubt that life in NK is not a happy one. I kind of now understand why those groups of defectors are so vociferous about destroying the NK regime. After all, they literally risked their lives to get out of there and their family and friends are still there, suffering.

As I have said earlier, I think the possibility of Kim peacefully giving up his regime is very very low. And I do not think the quality of life of North Koreans would improve. Without a military action, the NK regime will never change, and North Koreans suffer and their descendants will keep suffering.

They say if the US strikes the NK regime, NK would fire missiles to Seoul, and millions of people would die. But there are 25M North Koreans who are suffering and if we count their future generations, it could be over 100M in 100 years. If they are really Korean nationalists who want to help people in NK, couldn't they think that it might be worth to risk of millions of death (which is uncertain) to save tens of millions of North Koreans from suffering (which is certain)?

Again, I am not a nationalist, and I value my life more than the fate of a nation, so if I only care about myself, I do not want a war around me. But when I read stories about those poor people in NK, I sometimes feel that the NK regime should be destroyed to save them.

What do you think? Am I wrong about the possibility of peaceful unification? Is there a scenario that without a war those people in NK become free and well-fed?","This is my opinion based on what I have heard. It could be right or it could be wrong.

7289ho,What would be the ramifications of the US acknowledging North Korea's nuclear arsenal and normalizing relations?,What would be the ramifications of the US acknowledging North Korea's nuclear arsenal and normalizing relations?,"Edit: Sorry, I was on the road so didn't add my own POV earlier.

It seems that nobody in the US has really proposed this option in public yet. I wonder if the US could pull off another Kissinger-esque diplomatic judo flip on North Korea, and over the next 2-3 decades, build up NK to be a stable actor in the region. 

In my opinion, NK is a rational actor, although opaque in their decision-making processes. Kim does not strike me as a foolhardy buffoon. His internal moves (e.g., killing his uncle, assassinating his half-brother) are cruel, for sure, but appear to be a strategic move to reduce Beijing's influence on his regime, not simply because he's a psychopath. My understanding is that NK is first and foremost concerned about the threat of regime change from both the US and China, and secondly concerned about building up their economy/rejoining the international community. If the US were the first to reach out, could it somehow gain an advantage and slowly convert NK into an ally over the next few decades? 

In terms of NK interests, there certainly is no love lost between Beijing and the current regime. If the US could offer Kim safety guaranteed by a limited nuclear arsenal (with guarantee of no future ICBM development) + an economic aid and development package, wouldn't he take it? 

In terms of US interests, this would seem like the US folding on NK and diminish our ability to pressure other actors, but if it is done by a new president that isn't Trump, it could potentially be a convenient way for the US to restart relations in the region and think about building NK into the current international regime a la China. 

Personally, I do not think Kim will give up his nukes for anything in the world. They are his only guarantee against a military invasion.

72ofjm,The potential of a limited nuclear counterforce strike on North Korea using the B61-12 bomb,The potential of a limited nuclear counterforce strike on North Korea using the B61-12 bomb,"A few weeks ago I read [The New Era of Counterforce: Technological Change and the Future of Nuclear Deterrence](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/ISEC_a_00273) and found it incredibly informative and relevant especially with the situation that has unfolded in N.K. since.

The B61-12 is a GPS guided nuclear gravity bomb that has variable yields ranging from 0.3kt to 50kt. It is assumed to have similar accuracy to the JDAM. There has been considerable debate over this weapon because of it's ""usability"". The combination of  accuracy and a very low yield means that it can destroy hardened targets with negligible fallout and very little collateral damage.

These weapons are set to be deployed in 2019 and I doubt it is beyond the capabilities of the U.S. to have a portion of them ready before. Even if it is unavailable until 2019, imagine how tempting the thought must be for the Pentagon to use the bomb in a limited counterforce strike for hardened targets with conventional weapons taking care of the rest. 

A situation where Kim Jung Un dials back his rhetoric and we return to the status quo is probably what most people are hoping for. I think that neither the U.S. or China want this situation. 

The U.S. will be seen as impotent, unable to even prevent N.K. from launching ballistic missiles directly over it's allies. It will send a message to the world that a modest nuclear arsenal is capable of deterring even the U.S.

China will continue to be embarrassed by North Koreas provocations. More importantly, South Korea will remain willing to allow the U.S. to continue installing THAAD and potentially other defensive systems in the future.

China has made it clear that if the U.S. strikes N.K. first it will interfere. They also made it clear that they will stay out in the opposite situation. As far as I'm aware they haven't publicly defined what they would consider a first strike by North Korea. It seems plausible that China might actually want the U.S. to goad N.K. into doing something that wouldn't provide casus belli for an invasion, but could be used to justify a limited strike on their missile and nuclear programs. There have been plenty of such incidents over the decades, and North Korea has never had a U.S. president use rhetoric like Trump has.

If the U.S. succeeded, North Korea's missile and nuclear programs would be eliminated, the regime would remain in place preventing the refugee nightmare China is concerned with, and the U.S. will have demonstrated to nations considering starting up their own program that just posessing a small arsenal is no longer a deterrent. It seems like a win for everyone.

Kim Jung Un wouldn't be happy, but if he really is a rational actor why would he escalate and risk massive retaliation and his certain death?


I hope I haven't rambled too much, I haven't seen any discussion here about the possibility of a nuclear U.S. counterforce strike and I was just hoping to get some thoughts.

737v3k,Your president says that North Korea fears South Korean military without the US alliance to back it up - do you agree?,Your president says that North Korea fears South Korean military without the US alliance to back it up - do you agree?,"The Moon Jae-in administration is doing it again. His comments are once again undermining the alliance with the US by demanding the US to give up their wartime command and control. His logic is this. He says North Korea is deathly afraid of a more independent South Korean military without the US in the background. That's his logic. I just can't fathom this guy. I just can't.

So why now? Why is he doing this now, precisely at a time when we need to show the North Koreans that our countries have unity? My theory is that Moon is extremely afraid of the US military taking unilateral military action on North Korea. Look at how South Korea stood still doing nothing while the US stealth war planes flew a bombing practice over North Korea. Moon's fears finally came true when the US did that without S.Korea's input. Washington now thoroughly distrusts the North Korea appeasing South Korean Moon government who has said that a war on the Korean peninsula cannot happen even if it means the alliance with the US is dissolved.

By lessening the US military's role in South Korea, Moon is probably calculating that the war on the Korean peninsula will not happen. This government obviously blames the US for the North Korean nuclear crisis. His calculation is that a peace with North Korea can be obtained by unilaterally appeasing them by showering them with love. The US gets in the way of that plan. 

Moon's calculation is completely utterly wrong and it will fail South Korea's national security. He is playing a dangerous geopolitical game with our best ally and friend, which does not surprise me considering that he filled his high government positions with well-known extremely radical leftist anti-American protestor leaders, mostly active in the 1980's and 1990's. See the faces of these people now in the Moon government here.

They are known as the Jeondaehyop which was a huge movement demanding the US forces to leave South Korea, and a peaceful reunification with North Korea.  Moon was also part of this movement which advocated North Korea Juche self-reliance for South Korea with no foreign powers interfering with Korean people's self-governing rights.  Once you know a little bit about Moon's political background, then you begin to understand what this guy is all about.

Moon is a nationalist who believes in unified Korea for Koreans. He's a big secret fan of North Korea's Juche idea. He's an ideologist who overly idealizes the North Korean regime as a misunderstood lost brother who could be swayed into reason by showering him with love. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the goal if reunification of Korea's. But there is a problem if this means sharing power in the Korean peninsula with the current North Korean regime. They are incompatible with our way of life. But Moon thinks differently. 

This is why I consider Moon as the most dangerous man in South Korea. His miscalculations and his refusal to give up on his old ideology is leading South Korea to disaster. Ask yourselves this, once Moon takes full control of South Korean military's ability to carry out a war campaign, and with the US out of the way, do you honestly think that Moon will order his military to fight North Korea if North Korea attacks South Korea? I am now seriously doubting that. I expect he will order his men to stand down, while he tries to get on the phone to North Korea to beg for peace.

7m5wm8,From Korean War to Sino-American War: Four Potential Scenarios,From Korean War to Sino-American War Four Potential Scenarios,"War may return to the Korean Peninsula in 2018, threatening both regional security and economic growth. An escalation of intra-Korean hostilities could even escalate into Sino-American military conflict. Sound unlikely? It certainly did in 1950, when the US dismissed warnings that impoverished, backwards China would challenge a multinational coalition led by the world's dominant nuclear power. Here are four ways the Korean War could ultimately pit American soldiers against China's PLA:


**1. Conflicting Security Objectives**
In the early phases of the conflict, US and ROK Special Forces will rush to secure North Korea's nuclear infrastructure. Although the US has [assured](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/17/us/politics/tillerson-north-korea-china.html) China that US forces will not remain above the 38th parallel, much of North Korea's nuclear infrastructure lies in the region bordering China. From Beijing's perspective, US forces will be too close for comfort, even temporarily. The PLA will be deployed to protect Chinese interests, tasked with establishing refugee safe havens, securing DPRK weapons, monitoring US activities, and discouraging the deployment of US assets near the border. With US/ROK and PLA forces operating independently in the same conflict zone, the fog of war makes direct conflict a distinct possibility. Recent [military coordination](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-chinese-militaries-take-steps-to-coordinate-more-closely-1502812501) aims to reduce the risk, but could easily be undermined by mutual distrust. It's important to note that conflict does not require Chinese intervention in support of the North Korean regime, but could stem from China's own security interests colliding with those of the United States.


**2. Collateral Damage**
In 1988, the US [shot down](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/10/16/the-forgotten-story-of-iran-air-flight-655/?utm_term=.12c2388ec7f7) a civilian passenger plane above the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 aboard. In 1999, the US [bombed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/apr/10/balkans) China's Embassy in Belgrade, killing three and injuring twenty. In 2016, the US [bombed](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/29/politics/u-s-airstrike-hospital-afghanistan-investigation/index.html) a hospital in Afghanistan, killing 42 people. The common thread is that these incidents were all accidents, attributed to human error and plain bad luck. If US forces in North Korea have similar accidents and Chinese blood is spilled as a result, how will Beijing react? For example, USN counterproliferation patrols might sink a Chinese fishing trawler, mistaking it for a North Korean smuggling ship. Or a cruise missile might stray off course. Or an airstrike could release radiation/biohazards into China. Considering China's outrage over the Belgrade bombing (many still [insist](https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/oct/17/balkans) it was intentional), there would be considerable public pressure for Beijing to 'punish' the US. At the very least, the PLA would be tasked with preventing a recurrence. This will contribute to an atmosphere of distrust and raise the potential for conflict between the two powers.


**3. North Korean False Flag Attacks**
In the war's early days, North Korea could deliberately engineer conflict between the US and China. Imagine a cyberattack, appearing to originate from China, targeting USFK and PACOM communication networks. Hours later, US forces report multiple attacks by individuals wearing PLA special forces uniforms. Word would spread quickly on the ground, and US troops would assume their fears of Chinese intervention had come true. PLA forces in North Korea would immediately be viewed with suspicion, possibly even fired upon. The US would eventually realize North Korea's deception-- perhaps after capturing commandos in PLA uniform who don't speak Chinese-- but the damage would already be done. The reverse is also possible: DPRK forces disguised as ROK troops (or in captured US vehicles) could fire upon PLA forces, sewing fear and division in the hopes of hindering the American advance. The fact that this violates the Geneva Convention is hardly likely to deter North Korea.


**4. Exploiting America's Distraction**
Just as China [prepared to invade](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/why-didnt-mao-invade-taiwan-22752) Taiwan in 1950, the Korean War erupted. To halt communism's spread in Asia, America deployed the 7th Fleet to protect Taiwan, upending Beijing's invasion plan. In 2018, things are different: China's anti-ship missiles keep US carriers at bay, and the power differential between China and Taiwan continues to grow. America maintains a policy of 'strategic ambiguity' over its willingness to defend Taiwan, but with [security commitments](http://www.businessinsider.com/us-military-deployments-may-2017-5/#here-is-a-chart-of-the-significant-us-military-deployments-worldwide-10) in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Poland, and Ukraine, the herculean North Korea effort would stretch US forces thinner than ever. To Beijing, this may appear a window of opportunity in which America's distraction grants the PLA 'free reign' against Taiwan; Beijing would laud Chinese unification as a parallel to Korean unification, to be celebrated as the end of WWII-era divisions. Yet despite the risk of overextension, the US could still spring to Taiwan's defense. After all, Taiwan enjoys considerable support [across Congressional aisles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Taiwan_Caucus) and within the current Administration. Perhaps more importantly, a unified Korea and China leaves little justification for US forces in Korea and Japan. The removal of both conflicts would greatly weaken America's geopolitical position, while simultaneously enabling China to punch through the first island chain and [project power](https://thediplomat.com/2016/03/how-chinese-analysts-understand-taiwans-geostrategic-significance/) into the western Pacific. Could US-DPRK conflict truly lead to war over Taiwan? They may sound like two entirely separate issues, but as history reminds us, it's all connected.


Examining these scenarios alongside the [many other risks](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR300/RR331/RAND_RR331.pdf) associated with conflict in North Korea, it appears the dangers of war are considerably greater than the dangers of tolerating a nuclear-armed Pyongyang. Weighing these dangers also highlights the importance of close military/diplomatic coordination between the US and China. And of course, by analyzing the ways in which US-PLA forces could potentially come into conflict, we can better understand how it might be prevented.","War may return to the Korean Peninsula in 2018, threatening both regional security and economic growth.

Do you really think they want to extort America and break up the alliance with the South, like the CIA recent assessment? Or is it for defensive purposes regieme security?","To sum up what I understand is the new CIA assessment of the DPRK's goals: The DPRK wants the world to recognize them as a nuclear power. They want to threaten the US with nukes to eventually make them remove their military that is stationed in South Korea, and break up the US alliance with South Korea, not to mention the international coalition against them. Their goal might then shift to uniting the Korean Peninsula under their control somehow.

I feel like the CIA's recent assessment of the DPRK's goals is the US justifying the risk they are taking pressuring the Kim regime. It also seems to be the US excuse for not engaging in talks and a reaction to the South's attempts at talks with the DPRK. It seems to be a new assessment / new way of thinking about the DPRK's goals. It's like we are attributing goals to them that were not originally their goals, but logically I guess that could be their goal. It's a logical conclusion to a failed attempt at dialogue and containment, and the entire international coalition against the DPRK falling apart, and that seems to be a stretch of reality.

I find it unrealistic that the international coalition against them (and the fight against nuclear proliferation in general) could fall apart. I find it much more realistic that the DPRK only wants nukes for defense and regime security. I don't think the US should abandon the idea of dialogue and containment. Too many diplomatic failures would have to happen for that to fail, and the risk of a conflict with the DPRK escalating is too much of a catastrophic failure to risk.

The assessment also seems to make the assumption that the DPRK doesn't care about sanctions at all, that they will let their people starve and just look for illegal ways to support their military and weapons program. I think the DPRK cares about them, but they see no way out, and no one is showing them a way out. Trumps irrationally (if miscalculated use of Twitter) pressuring them on Twitter is causing that. Their people are starving... the sanctions are working. Yet the sanctions aren't being used correctly. It's not the choices they are making it's the choices they are left with.","To sum up what I understand is the new CIA assessment of the DPRK's goals The DPRK wants the world to recognize them as a nuclear power.

I am in no way trying to promote his opinion. Please only take his words as a reference, because **he was addressing a domestic audience**. The transcript is below

========================================================
(*Start of the interview*)

**In 2018 I feel the North Korea nuclear crisis has approached a turning point (to the worse).** The reason behind this is the quick advancement of NK's nuclear and missile technology. It has reached the red line defined by USA, which is, NK is not allowed to have nuclear ICBM with ranges that can reach the United States. 

In the past year (referring to 2016 because the interview was done in 2017) NK has conducted 20 missile tests and two nuclear tests. From the data of those tests, NK's technology made vast leap forward. Some of the technology has exceeded the red line, some are getting close. For example, NK recently launched ""Mars 15"" which is capable of reach the US. Experts predicted its range has probably exceeded 12,000 km. That is enough to reach the US. On the other hand, some NK's technology are not mature enough, such as the minimization of nuclear warhead, and ICBM reentry. NK is still a few steps from a true integration of nuclear and missile technology. In this stage, NK is already one step on the red line. 

The consequences is **US has no choice but make a genuine attempt to solve the issue**. Previously, US government opinion is like this: NK owns some very primitive nuclear weapons, and mid/short range missiles. NK will pose as a threat to SK, Japan, even the north of Australia, including ASEAN countries. And of course NK is a threat to both Russia and China (laugh). US might think the situation is pretty good. But once NK's nuclear threat can reach the US, US has a change of attitude. Previously in Pres. Obama era, US policy toward NK is called “strategic tolerance”. Pres. Trump changed it to ""extreme pressure"". With the NK's technology advancements, and US change of attitude, combined, the **NK nuclear issue has reached a turning point: something major is going to happen**.

========================================================

(*On NK's capability development*)

Many parties should be held responsible for the development of NK's nuclear issue. Undeniably US must accept a fairly large part of the responsibility. Of course NK is most responsible. 

In the Cold War era, NK has made preparations of nuclear weapon technology. Today when we want to understand the issue in depth, look a bit further into history. What can history tell us? **North Korea has quite a bit of industrial capability. Among small and mid countries, Nk's industrial capability is relatively strong.** 

**The first source of NK's industry was investments made by Japan**. We know in 1910s Japan forced Korea to merge with Japan. They signed ""Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty"". After that Japan made long term commitment to occupy Korea long term. They made large investments in building the industrial base. The investment focused in the northern areas of Korea. Why not the south? Because the southern areas do not have minerals. This is the historical context. During the Japan Occupation Period, Korea has developed some level of industrial base. 

Sometimes you see internet users from South Korea, **blame China for the separation of North and South Koreas**.  This is not right. China was not responsible for (the separation of Koreas), because it has nothing to do with China. In February of 1945, USA met with USSR in Yalta. They made a trade between them. USA invited USSR to send troops to the Far East, three months after the European war, to help US beat Japan together. As an exchange, Korea is divided into two. The South will be occupied by the US. The North will be left to USSR rule. This agreement leads to the separate occupation later. Then it becomes two Koreas. So the division of Korea is the result of a US/USSR trade. More precisely, North Korea as a country was created by the USSR. It's government was created by the Red Army. **In the hearts of North Korean people, USSR is the eternal ""god father""**. NK has never considered China as the big brother. Never before. Some Chinese people may consider China is the big brother of NK, they are very wrong. So USSR supported NK, during the Cold War era, **USSR invested in industries in NK, and allowed NK goods to enter the market of USSR and East Europe. NK's industrial base is further strengthened.** 

NK's first leader (Kim Il-sung) had a lot of ambition. His dream is to reunite all of Korea and becomes the national hero. So he started preparation for nuclear weapon quite early. In 1955 NK signed with USSR the agreement for cooperation in nuclear energy. NK has a lot of Uranium mines. They sell Uranium to USSR, in exchange, receive technical support of nuclear energy. The cooperation started in 1955 and lasted till 1987. With the pressure from USA, Gorbachev stopped the cooperation. By then, based on data from US, USSR helped NK to educate and train more than 2000 nuclear scientists, as well as 6000 nuclear tech workers. So NK has both some industrial base, and the technology on nuclear energy. After the Cold War is over, NK was in a difficult stage, national security, economy, as well as diplomacy. NK started development of nuclear weapons. We then have the NK nuclear crisis. 

========================================================
(On China's stance)
**From the start, China and South Korea advised USA to hold a low stance, has direct talk with NK, and tried to establish diplomatic relationship, to normalize relationship.** In exchange, NK will give up the nuclear weapon plan. But apparently, the efforts had failed. The main policy from the US is to apply pressure on NK, but not through dialog. After that we saw NK has been more decisive in having nuclear weapons. Then we reached a deadlock. In the process we actually had a few opportunities for compromises, but unfortunately none of them was successful. The situation had deteriorated to today's crisis, I think NK is most responsible. **NK says the need for nuclear weapon is for national defense. This argument is not justified.** In this world, many countries are under the threat of USA: such as Venezuela, Cuba, ... to name a few. But these countries did not attempt to own nuclear weapons. If NK's way is successful, other countries will follow. If NK has nuclear weapons, SK also wants to have nuclear weapons. Then Japan. We all know Japan is supporting Taiwan's independence from China. Then Taiwan would like to develop nuclear weapons too. That's real chaotic. So even though NK's decision has some merits, from the global perspective, it is not the best choice.

**From China's perspective, NK's best choice is opening up, just like Vietnam.** That is to pick a develop path like China. Once NK is opening up, we all develop economy, US will not come and attack you. We know that NK's public education is not bad. NK has a lot of resources. So follow China's footstep, NK is likely to be successful. NK has better options than developing nuclear weapons. But they chose, stubbornly, the very dangerous path. So **NK is most responsible for NK nuclear crisis.**

========================================================
(On US involvement)

US is the second party responsible for NK nuclear crisis. US hold the advantages. If US makes a concession, especially in the early days, maybe the crisis will not develop into today's situation. We should say, the reason behind US's policy is very complex. NK's closing up itself, causing the sense of insecurity, and nobody will trust NK. Due to historical reasons, NK still believes his big brother is Russia. But Russia today does not have the capacity to deal with NK. China wants to help NK, and China is capable of doing so. **But NK does not trust China.** NK does not trust US either. China repeatedly tell NK to adopt the opening up policy like China did. NK always refuses. So NK has been stubborn, missed all the opportunities. On the America side, the problem is US does not trust NK. The r""report on national security"" is calling NK as a rogue state, along with Iran, in the official document! 

China keeps saying all parties have responsibility. NK and US hold most responsibility. China and SK are most serious to solve the crisis. That is easy to understand. If the worst scenario becomes reality, it will cause great damage to China. And China and SK both have fast developing economy. We don't want to cause interruptions of economy due to NK nuclear crisis.

(On Russia's involvement)

The situation can get complex after Russia's active involvement. I think Russia wants to play a global chess game with US. Till today I still believe Russia's elites, especially Putin himself, are genuinely trying to build a good relation with the US. But because Putin knows, in the United States, many decision makers still have Cold War mentality. Those people have deep-rooted distrust of Russia. Because Russia and the US have conflicts, e.g. in Ukraine, and in the Middle East. Plus the Western media, as well as intellectuals, are not happy with the authoritarian rule in Russia. To add more pawns for Russia, Putin intervened in Syria, in the name of anti-terrorism. The result is Syria government did not fall, that is one of Russia's pawns. But it is not enough. Putin might be considering adding NK as another pawn. There is a **possible development that Russia becomes the intermediary between US and NK**, replacing some role of China. 

To NK, turning to Russia for help is risky. If Russia involves in this, the motivation is not to help NK, but to help Russia's chess game with US. Russia may sell out NK when the time is right. But you know, people can be stubborn at times. I suspect the elites in NK knows about the risk. But speaking from emotions, NK trusts Russia more. So we saw sometimes Russia is playing a more important role than China (he was talking about some time in late 2017) 

========================================================
(On China's importance)

I don't think China should be worried about its status. In this crisis, China's importance exists objectively. NK relies on China. Almost all of NK's northern border is with China's. Russia/NK share about 13km border. China/NK share about 1400km border. Geographically China is close to NK. Economically NK relies on China. If in the worst case scenario, NK wants help from another country other than US, it is likely China is capable of helping NK more than Russia. **This decides China's involvement is inevitable.**
 
In 2017 NK nuclear issue had fundamental changes. It went from an issue that can be further delayed, to a turning point into a crisis. 
**It can no longer be postponed. We are approaching the final showdown**. 2018 is a real challenge. I suspect the NK nuclear crisis will be resolved in 2018. The solution can be negotiation/agreement, or conflicts involving military actions. No matter the format, we will see a definitive result. It is a huge diplomatic challenge for China. What do we know when war breaks out. China has its own interests, we can't rely on other nation's good will. We have to protect our own interests, that is the sign of a great nation. In a war scenario China should have its own plan. 

The views on NK nuclear issue inside US are split. Some, like President Trump, still does not trust NK, truly wants a war. But the mainstream US diplomats still want negotiation. By negotiation US is preparing to accept NK is a nuclear-capable nation. So far these two types of views in US have comparable influence. War/negotiation probability is 50/50. Now the attitude of NK is important. If NK plays the game will extraordinary skills, US diplomacy may win. If NK plays the game too much, they will help the hawks in US. So the war/negotiation decision is not only by US but also by NK. I think if NK carry out plans as their propaganda, that is, to have thermonuclear test in the Pacific, or NK shoots four missiles to Guam, then the situation will be very dangerous. US has to intercept the missiles. As NK said, interception means war. The risk of war will be high. If US, after sanctions, decided to blockade NK from the sea, to NK that also means war. So the risk to war is high.

Here China must be clear, NK nuclear crisis can not be postponed further. We must have a plan once it reaches the turning point. War or diplomacy.

In this crisis, China's importance exists objectively. NK relies on China. Almost all of NK's northern border is with China's. Russia NK share about 13km border. China NK share about 1400km border. Geographically China is close to NK. Economically NK relies on China. If in the worst case scenario, NK wants help from another country other than US, it is likely China is capable of helping NK more than Russia. This decides China's involvement is inevitable. In 2017 NK nuclear issue had fundamental changes. It went from an issue that can be further delayed, to a turning point into a crisis. It can no longer be postponed. We are approaching the final showdown . 2018 is a real challenge. I suspect the NK nuclear crisis will be resolved in 2018. The solution can be negotiation agreement, or conflicts involving military actions. No matter the format, we will see a definitive result. It is a huge diplomatic challenge for China. What do we know when war breaks out. China has its own interests, we can't rely on other nation's good will. We have to protect our own interests, that is the sign of a great nation. In a war scenario China should have its own plan. The views on NK nuclear issue inside US are split. Some, like President Trump, still does not trust NK, truly wants a war. But the mainstream US diplomats still want negotiation. By negotiation US is preparing to accept NK is a nuclear-capable nation. So far these two types of views in US have comparable influence. War negotiation probability is 50 50. Now the attitude of NK is important. If NK plays the game will extraordinary skills, US diplomacy may win. If NK plays the game too much, they will help the hawks in US. So the war negotiation decision is not only by US but also by NK. I think if NK carry out plans as their propaganda, that is, to have thermonuclear test in the Pacific, or NK shoots four missiles to Guam, then the situation will be very dangerous. US has to intercept the missiles. As NK said, interception means war. The risk of war will be high. If US, after sanctions, decided to blockade NK from the sea, to NK that also means war. So the risk to war is high. Here China must be clear, NK nuclear crisis can not be postponed further. We must have a plan once it reaches the turning point. War or diplomacy. the end",loscrimmage,31,6,1522177111,2018-03-27 14:58:31,2018-03-27,2018,3,2018-03,geopolitics,/r/geopolitics/comments/87l2kv/north_korea_nuclear_issue_will_be_resolved_in/,arctic_shift,korea nuclear,,False,-0.9956,0.135,0.141,0.724,0.0662048872180451,0.4997994987468672,neutral,4,0.3805769580076251,POSITIVE,0.945236086845398,0.945236086845398,positive,"""North Korea nuclear issue will be resolved in 2018"" - review of the issue from China's perspective. By Jin Canrong [The video is posted on youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yxgRis5-5g) Date of interview is late 2017 (I think winter 2017 is most likely). It contains quite some content that is a good summary of China's perspective. I hope this helps some people understand one of the hottest geopolitical topic. 

Prof. Jin Canrong is an outspoken researcher of international relations in China. To me, this is one of his better interviews and is unlikely to be misunderstood. I am in no way trying to promote his opinion. Please only take his words as a reference, because **he was addressing a domestic audience**. The transcript is below

========================================================
(*Start of the interview*)

**In 2018 I feel the North Korea nuclear crisis has approached a turning point (to the worse).** The reason behind this is the quick advancement of NK's nuclear and missile technology. It has reached the red line defined by USA, which is, NK is not allowed to have nuclear ICBM with ranges that can reach the United States. 

In the past year (referring to 2016 because the interview was done in 2017) NK has conducted 20 missile tests and two nuclear tests. From the data of those tests, NK's technology made vast leap forward. Some of the technology has exceeded the red line, some are getting close. For example, NK recently launched ""Mars 15"" which is capable of reach the US. Experts predicted its range has probably exceeded 12,000 km. That is enough to reach the US. On the other hand, some NK's technology are not mature enough, such as the minimization of nuclear warhead, and ICBM reentry. NK is still a few steps from a true integration of nuclear and missile technology. In this stage, NK is already one step on the red line. 

The consequences is **US has no choice but make a genuine attempt to solve the issue**. Previously, US government opinion is like this: NK owns some very primitive nuclear weapons, and mid/short range missiles. NK will pose as a threat to SK, Japan, even the north of Australia, including ASEAN countries. And of course NK is a threat to both Russia and China (laugh). US might think the situation is pretty good. But once NK's nuclear threat can reach the US, US has a change of attitude. Previously in Pres. Obama era, US policy toward NK is called “strategic tolerance”. Pres. Trump changed it to ""extreme pressure"". With the NK's technology advancements, and US change of attitude, combined, the **NK nuclear issue has reached a turning point: something major is going to happen**.

========================================================

(*On NK's capability development*)

Many parties should be held responsible for the development of NK's nuclear issue. Undeniably US must accept a fairly large part of the responsibility. Of course NK is most responsible. 

In the Cold War era, NK has made preparations of nuclear weapon technology. Today when we want to understand the issue in depth, look a bit further into history. What can history tell us? **North Korea has quite a bit of industrial capability. Among small and mid countries, Nk's industrial capability is relatively strong.** 

**The first source of NK's industry was investments made by Japan**. We know in 1910s Japan forced Korea to merge with Japan. They signed ""Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty"". After that Japan made long term commitment to occupy Korea long term. They made large investments in building the industrial base. The investment focused in the northern areas of Korea. Why not the south? Because the southern areas do not have minerals. This is the historical context. During the Japan Occupation Period, Korea has developed some level of industrial base. 

Sometimes you see internet users from South Korea, **blame China for the separation of North and South Koreas**.  This is not right. China was not responsible for (the separation of Koreas), because it has nothing to do with China. In February of 1945, USA met with USSR in Yalta. They made a trade between them. USA invited USSR to send troops to the Far East, three months after the European war, to help US beat Japan together. As an exchange, Korea is divided into two. The South will be occupied by the US. The North will be left to USSR rule. This agreement leads to the separate occupation later. Then it becomes two Koreas. So the division of Korea is the result of a US/USSR trade. More precisely, North Korea as a country was created by the USSR. It's government was created by the Red Army. **In the hearts of North Korean people, USSR is the eternal ""god father""**. NK has never considered China as the big brother. Never before. Some Chinese people may consider China is the big brother of NK, they are very wrong. So USSR supported NK, during the Cold War era, **USSR invested in industries in NK, and allowed NK goods to enter the market of USSR and East Europe. NK's industrial base is further strengthened.** 

NK's first leader (Kim Il-sung) had a lot of ambition. His dream is to reunite all of Korea and becomes the national hero. So he started preparation for nuclear weapon quite early. In 1955 NK signed with USSR the agreement for cooperation in nuclear energy. NK has a lot of Uranium mines. They sell Uranium to USSR, in exchange, receive technical support of nuclear energy. The cooperation started in 1955 and lasted till 1987. With the pressure from USA, Gorbachev stopped the cooperation. By then, based on data from US, USSR helped NK to educate and train more than 2000 nuclear scientists, as well as 6000 nuclear tech workers. So NK has both some industrial base, and the technology on nuclear energy. After the Cold War is over, NK was in a difficult stage, national security, economy, as well as diplomacy. NK started development of nuclear weapons. We then have the NK nuclear crisis. 

========================================================
(On China's stance)
**From the start, China and South Korea advised USA to hold a low stance, has direct talk with NK, and tried to establish diplomatic relationship, to normalize relationship.** In exchange, NK will give up the nuclear weapon plan. But apparently, the efforts had failed. The main policy from the US is to apply pressure on NK, but not through dialog. After that we saw NK has been more decisive in having nuclear weapons. Then we reached a deadlock. In the process we actually had a few opportunities for compromises, but unfortunately none of them was successful. The situation had deteriorated to today's crisis, I think NK is most responsible. **NK says the need for nuclear weapon is for national defense. This argument is not justified.** In this world, many countries are under the threat of USA: such as Venezuela, Cuba, ... to name a few. But these countries did not attempt to own nuclear weapons. If NK's way is successful, other countries will follow. If NK has nuclear weapons, SK also wants to have nuclear weapons. Then Japan. We all know Japan is supporting Taiwan's independence from China. Then Taiwan would like to develop nuclear weapons too. That's real chaotic. So even though NK's decision has some merits, from the global perspective, it is not the best choice.

**From China's perspective, NK's best choice is opening up, just like Vietnam.** That is to pick a develop path like China. Once NK is opening up, we all develop economy, US will not come and attack you. We know that NK's public education is not bad. NK has a lot of resources. So follow China's footstep, NK is likely to be successful. NK has better options than developing nuclear weapons. But they chose, stubbornly, the very dangerous path. So **NK is most responsible for NK nuclear crisis.**

========================================================
(On US involvement)

US is the second party responsible for NK nuclear crisis. US hold the advantages. If US makes a concession, especially in the early days, maybe the crisis will not develop into today's situation. We should say, the reason behind US's policy is very complex. NK's closing up itself, causing the sense of insecurity, and nobody will trust NK. Due to historical reasons, NK still believes his big brother is Russia. But Russia today does not have the capacity to deal with NK. China wants to help NK, and China is capable of doing so. **But NK does not trust China.** NK does not trust US either. China repeatedly tell NK to adopt the opening up policy like China did. NK always refuses. So NK has been stubborn, missed all the opportunities. On the America side, the problem is US does not trust NK. The r""report on national security"" is calling NK as a rogue state, along with Iran, in the official document! 

China keeps saying all parties have responsibility. NK and US hold most responsibility. China and SK are most serious to solve the crisis. That is easy to understand. If the worst scenario becomes reality, it will cause great damage to China. And China and SK both have fast developing economy. We don't want to cause interruptions of economy due to NK nuclear crisis.

(On Russia's involvement)

The situation can get complex after Russia's active involvement. I think Russia wants to play a global chess game with US. Till today I still believe Russia's elites, especially Putin himself, are genuinely trying to build a good relation with the US. But because Putin knows, in the United States, many decision makers still have Cold War mentality. Those people have deep-rooted distrust of Russia. Because Russia and the US have conflicts, e.g. in Ukraine, and in the Middle East. Plus the Western media, as well as intellectuals, are not happy with the authoritarian rule in Russia. To add more pawns for Russia, Putin intervened in Syria, in the name of anti-terrorism. The result is Syria government did not fall, that is one of Russia's pawns. But it is not enough. Putin might be considering adding NK as another pawn. There is a **possible development that Russia becomes the intermediary between US and NK**, replacing some role of China. 

To NK, turning to Russia for help is risky. If Russia involves in this, the motivation is not to help NK, but to help Russia's chess game with US. Russia may sell out NK when the time is right. But you know, people can be stubborn at times. I suspect the elites in NK knows about the risk. But speaking from emotions, NK trusts Russia more. So we saw sometimes Russia is playing a more important role than China (he was talking about some time in late 2017) 

========================================================
(On China's importance)

I don't think China should be worried about its status. In this crisis, China's importance exists objectively. NK relies on China. Almost all of NK's northern border is with China's. Russia/NK share about 13km border. China/NK share about 1400km border. Geographically China is close to NK. Economically NK relies on China. If in the worst case scenario, NK wants help from another country other than US, it is likely China is capable of helping NK more than Russia. **This decides China's involvement is inevitable.**
 
In 2017 NK nuclear issue had fundamental changes. It went from an issue that can be further delayed, to a turning point into a crisis. 
**It can no longer be postponed. We are approaching the final showdown**. 2018 is a real challenge. I suspect the NK nuclear crisis will be resolved in 2018. The solution can be negotiation/agreement, or conflicts involving military actions. No matter the format, we will see a definitive result. It is a huge diplomatic challenge for China. What do we know when war breaks out. China has its own interests, we can't rely on other nation's good will. We have to protect our own interests, that is the sign of a great nation. In a war scenario China should have its own plan. 

The views on NK nuclear issue inside US are split. Some, like President Trump, still does not trust NK, truly wants a war. But the mainstream US diplomats still want negotiation. By negotiation US is preparing to accept NK is a nuclear-capable nation. So far these two types of views in US have comparable influence. War/negotiation probability is 50/50. Now the attitude of NK is important. If NK plays the game will extraordinary skills, US diplomacy may win. If NK plays the game too much, they will help the hawks in US. So the war/negotiation decision is not only by US but also by NK. I think if NK carry out plans as their propaganda, that is, to have thermonuclear test in the Pacific, or NK shoots four missiles to Guam, then the situation will be very dangerous. US has to intercept the missiles. As NK said, interception means war. The risk of war will be high. If US, after sanctions, decided to blockade NK from the sea, to NK that also means war. So the risk to war is high.

Here China must be clear, NK nuclear crisis can not be postponed further. We must have a plan once it reaches the turning point. War or diplomacy.

One theory I've had is that everything increasingly shifted after some point towards deterring intervention from China over the USA.

Lately, we've seen North Korea:

1. Kill the only potential heir a third party could support in the event of a coup. USA and South Korea wouldn't use that guy as a puppet ruler but china likely would. Killing of Kim Jong Nam's brother in public no less was pointless unless there was a significant risk justifying it. 

2. Increasingly worsening relations between China and North Korea.

3. The temporary for now softening of relations between north and south since the olympics. 

4. a new ruler who likely doesn't share the same mindset of his father who had to claw his way to the hereditary ascension. Kim Jong Il's nuclear program had it's reasons for existing but the current administration doesn't have to follow them. Said new regime might not be as secure against threats as the prior one leaving open new possibilities for China to influence or even co-opt the direction of policy.

In the event of the new ruler considering unification on more reasonable terms, China would likely be against it. In fact, if the current regime suspected a potential coup by China aligned elites then unification with the south would become the surest method of survival for the elites in power. 

Right now, the potential of a first strike by USA/South Korea without provocation by NK is extraordinarily unlikely (as it has been for decades even before nuclear weapons). The only legitimate military threat/risk right now is China which is the only player who would have a reasonable excuse to change the regime. Nuclear weapons serve as an effective deterrent against the last remaining threat and thus nuclear weapons R&D has continued.

But given the timing, was it not more likely a deliberate signal to NK that they had better be prepared to make the concessions necessary to convince Congress?

The worst possible outcome for the US would be a half-measure or incrementally implemented deal that relieves pressure on NK only for NK to renege and rebound in an even more powerful position in future. On the other hand, it would be difficult to demand to NK's faces, after their charm offensive and gestures of good faith, that they should give up everything before receiving anything.

Could it be that withdrawing from the JCPOA was intended to resolve this dilemma? When negotiating with NK, the Trump administration can now point to the failure of JCPOA as justification for pursuing nothing less than a treaty with Congress, and then to the inflexibility of Congress as justification for making heavy demands before giving any concessions.

The Trump administration can now credibly exhibit good faith and trust in NK's intentions by pointing to Congress as an unshakable reality/constraint both parties have to work under -- a kind of good-cop bad-cop situation.

Ultimately the JCPOA may have eliminated a middle-ground that was considered dangerous from the American perspective, but would have been difficult to avoid by persuasion/positive negotiation.

Any thoughts?

945nqu,My take on Trumps meeting with Kim Jong Un,My take on Trumps meeting with Kim Jong Un,"1. We are caught in a strange historical moment. Trump, the American President just shook hands happily with a North Korean Dictator. 

2. US policy makers and president alike wouldn’t be caught dead shaking hands with a North Korean Dictator.  (Although Clinton did meet with the Kim Jung Il Citation: [https://abcnews.go.com/International/prominent-americans-met-north-korean-leaders/story?id=53635089](https://abcnews.go.com/International/prominent-americans-met-north-korean-leaders/story?id=53635089)).  However President is Trump is an anomaly.  He truly seems to act on his own, good or bad.  So why was Trump able to set up this seemingly peaceful meeting, especially after all the “little rocket man” rhetoric?

3. North Korea is pretty isolated.  Its main allies are China, who acts like a big brother, and Russia.  Russia doesn’t affiliate themselves with too much with North Korea, but some speculate Russia helped North Korea obtain nuclear capabilities more quickly.  They share a small border as well.

4. In the Trump era, America has entered a strange space.  He doesn’t follow normal American policy, which is obvious.  

5. During the 2016 American presidential primaries the Republican Party changed an important party policy on the Crimea takeover by Russia.  Trump apparently directed the change to more or less support the Russians on the Crimea annexation.  Trump even recently repeated a talking point by Putin himself saying “everyone there speaks Russian”, therefore Crimea is essentially Russian territory.

6. Trump has flip flopped and given criticism to everyone in the past two years, even his own children.  The one person he doesn’t flip flop on?  President Vladimir Putin.  So what the hell is going on?

7.Earlier we mentioned North Koreas allies, which is important..  Who benefits from these Geopolitical decisions?  Because it definitely isn’t the US overall.

8. The United States has soft power all over the globe.  Its one of the great benefits of the Post WWII order, which the US directed.  America has “800 military bases in more than 70 countries and territories” \[[https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/us-military-bases-around-the-world-119321](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/us-military-bases-around-the-world-119321)\]

9. Directly after Trump met face to Face with Kim he decided to cut off War Games with South Korea in the Korean peninsula, citing costs.  Trump seems to believe that saving money is more important than having a military presence in one of the nations most contested sea beds.  Just south of the Korean peninsula, in the South China Sea the Chinese have an unprecedented presence.  They have been creating entire islands in order to have more control over the vital commerce and shipping done by ship.   After World War II the United states had near overt control of the oceans and shipping lanes; something never accomplished by any other nation in history.  So why would the United States jeopardize this accomplishment?

10.  The winners here are many but not the United States.  China, South Korea, Japan, Russia and North Korea all gain wins from Trumps meeting with Kim.  Here is how:

11. China, Russia and North Korea gain a win by seeing the presence of the American military vanish.  In turn the Us military gets hit by losing a close vantage point where they can watch North Korea and China, while helping allies S. Korea and Japan.  America has more warships than any nation combined; even one of these vessels deters aggression in the region.  This sea is also close to Russia, who would like to see American warships vanish.  Trump thinks it’s a waste of money and wants to pull them out.  We’ll see.  

12.  However the world becomes a winner if the negative warmongering rhetoric and threats go away.  If Trump succeeds in getting North Korea to denuclearize it is a grand win for the World. 

13.  Lets tally up the geopolitical score here.  Putin wins in a few ways.  They see an ally of theirs \[N. Korea\] get brought up to the world stage by meeting face to face with the leader of the free world.  They get respect and confirmation from the American president and one of their biggest parties, the GOP, that the Crimea takeover was legitimate; and they get American soft power removed from the Korean peninsula.  China also wins in these ways.  North Korea now looks levelheaded and willing to bring themselves into the fold of the global  order.  South Korea wins because this opens the field to possible reunification.  The capital of South Korea is 60 miles from the border with the north.  South Koreans have lived under the threat of bombardment of artillery and even worse: possible nuclear weapons.  Japan also wins in this way.  America wins if the North Korean threats are squashed for good, but only time will tell.  It’s a gamble but for a president who hasn’t been able to court any domestic wins overtly, it does seem to be a win for him and his administration in a strange way, albeit a confusing one. 

Please correct me if Im wrong on any of my statements.  Im just trying to encourage discussion.","1. We are caught in a strange historical moment.

We’re acutely conscious that there are many smarter, and more experienced people who frequent this sub, so we’re very keen to hear your takes.

Our three most significant stories this week:

* The US and China are now putting together a process aimed at resolving their trade dispute by November, when Xi and Trump will meet.

* South Korea allegedly asked the United States to consider formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War – in a bid to break a stall in US-North Korea talks.

* The US restructured the State Department, creating a special group focused on Iran – headed up by the former Director of Policy Planning (a very senior role). Pompeo said this is about changing Iranian behaviour, while experts said this is about changing the Iranian regime. 

Our three most thought-provoking articles of the week:

* Richard Haas, himself a former Director of Policy Planning, argued that without the glue of the Soviet threat, the US-Turkey relationship is destined to deteriorate.

* Rebecca Collard of Time Magazine gave a good overview of the stakes in Idlib, Syria – a city awaiting its fate as Assad’s tanks roll into position for a potential advance.

*  David Fickling of Bloomberg asked big questions of the fundamental economics of many of China’s Belt and Road projects, and argued that there are “echoes” of Soviet era collapse in Beijing’s misdirected spending. 

Three events to watch in the coming week:

* Whether the US and Turkey can patch over some of their many differences, after Turkey’s Foreign Minister said, “we are ready to talk about everything” so long as there’s “no threatening, no dictating”.

* Whether agreement on process can translate to agreement on sticky substantive issues at the US-China trade talks on 22 & 23 August.

* Whether US National Security Advisor John Bolton can make modest progress with Russia on arms control, at the follow up to the Trump-Putin summit.

9sgwdi,[serious] Koreas ways in nuclear energy,serious Koreas ways in nuclear energy,"Greetings from Germany,

first of: I am not really interested in any clarifications by major news outlets or political parties. I would like estimates and general feelings from actual citizens. Thank you.

I just have seen the Movie ""Pandora"" from 2016. At the end the movie mentioned that Korea is the country having the highest density of nuclear plants across the globe.

I never really got into researching social thought process and view of countries way closer to Fukushima than Germany and Japan itself.

Some documentary in Germany finds very clear words for the distasteful way Japanese government and energy business handled and handles the entire topic.

I am very interested if someone could report for her/himself how they felt having a plant blow up pretty close to them. Or if they know any reports or diaries of Korean origin written and published over that time until now. They can be unobjective, full of fear or risk denial, I would like the full board of available emotions.

Thank you for taking your time to read this.
Thank you even more when replying in what form ever.

Have a nice evening.","Greetings from Germany, first of I am not really interested in any clarifications by major news outlets or political parties.

9u9vq4,Global Security Implications for (Northern-lead) Union/Confederation Between North and South Korea,Global Security Implications for Northern-lead Union Confederation Between North and South Korea,"SCMP recently published an excellent article about the recent drive by the South Korean government to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis, and the broader inter-Korean conflict in general, by reunifying with North Korea into a One-Country/Two-System Union or Confederation, which I have occasionally argued on here was the real crisis the nuclear drama was building toward all along. 


https://m.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2170456/could-hong-kongs-one-country-two-systems-work-korea


Why do I describe it as a ""crisis""? Because there's very little reason to believe union/confederation will resolve the conflict, pacify the Kim Regime, soften North Korea/lead to its eventual absorption by the South or even lead to peaceful coexistence between the two states. 


On the contrary, union/confederation could (and probably would) leave South Korea dangerously exposed to North Korean infiltration, political manipulation and coercion. There's a lot of evidence and analysis that suggests Kim will take every opportunity over the following several years after reunification to try and extract money/resources from the South, wrest political powers away from it and bully it into becoming the lesser, subservient power; possibly even with the goal of one day absorbing South Korea into the North. 


(Indeed, North Korea has always seen Confederation as a possible means of ""peacefully"" conquering South Korea) 


Personally, I think Kim *might* denuclearize, but only at the cost of outside powers butting out and letting it continue to cannibalize South Korea. I think this also *could* lead to a conventional war (if, for example, South Korea resists or tries to pull out later, which may compel Kim to retaliate or attempt a hard/fast-takeover in order to keep the South from slipping from his grasp, and if SK asks the US for help after). 


Still, even if that doesn't happen, I think Kim will go the Russia-route and resort to asymmetric hybrid warfare in order to bully or manipulate South Korea into compliance; there's other ways to conquer a state besides outright military invasion.


Even if ""Korean War II"" isn't a conventional military conflict (which I've argued that it won't be), the global and regional security implications (as well as the American national security implications) are severe.


(Seriously, it's baffling why this isn't a bigger story and alarm bells aren't going off in the US public discourse) 


It's difficult to list them in any specific order, so I guess I will just use the shotgun-approach lay them all out, since it's extraordinarily difficult to find any serious predictions on how this can all turn out.


(And once again, I'm going on the assumption that union/confederation would be led and dominated by the North Koreans) 


**A)** If North Korea and South Korea reunify, would the ROK-US Alliance treaties and charters instantly become null-and-void (as well as all of the international sanctions against North Korea)? Would a ""Korean Union"" or ""Korean Federation"" or ""United States of Korea"" constitute a successor-state that is not bound by the treaties of its former constituent-states?

(I don't think there's anyway to be allies with, or to sanction, ""half of a state"" against its other half.)


**B)** Even if the US could be allies with Seoul after the deal is signed, it's difficult to see how political support for the alliance could be maintained for long.


The ROK-US Alliance was established with the goal of compelling the US to defend South Korea from a hostile North Korea. Union/Confederation might mean there won't be a ""South Korea"" for the US to defend (nor a ""North Korea to defend it from).


**C)** Would Americans determine there is no longer a point in sending US troops to Korea and pull them out? Would South Koreans determine there is no longer a point in keeping US troops in Korea and evict them?


Or would China (which has *Okay*-relations with South Korea) bear down on South Korea and force them too kick US troops out and terminate the Alliance? Right now, China only maintains decent relations with South Korea (despite hosting US troops) because they understand the threat North Korea poses to the South; it's difficult to see why they would continue tolerating US troops in South Korea once union/confederation takes place.


(Korea scholar BR Myers has stated, ""Imagine if the US military were [in Korea] *purely* as a counterweight to China...China would bring this whole peninsula to its knees in a matter of months."") 


https://soundcloud.com/war_college/north-koreas-long-game

**D)** If the US is stupid enough to maintain the ROK-US Alliance after North-South union/confederation, what risks does that pose to the US? The US and ROK militaries are deeply integrated; if North Korea were to merge with the South, how much access would that give them to US military strategy, tactics and intelligence by-proxy?

**E)** Joshua Stanton (a former US Forces Korea officer who's testified on ROK-US Alliance issues to congress written for FP, the WSJ, etc.) has said that it is no coincidence that North Korea developed its cyber-warfare capabilities at the same pace South Korea (famously) became the most wired society on earth.

I think the implications are that North Korea doesn't want to nationalize or stamp out South Korea's market economy, but rather to profit off of it.


And quite possibly, exploit it for its own transnational criminal operations (drug manufacturing, arms smuggling, counterfeiting, cyber crime/terrorism, etc.)


What are the chances union/confederation will lead to, say, North Korean spy-ware on Samsung Galaxy phones? Or North Korean drugs/weapons being smuggled through South Korean ports (or maybe on Korean Air jets)?


**F)** If KJU fails to restrain himself (let's be honest; he will) and the outside world continues to feel the need to isolate and sanction him, what are the chances that will negatively impact South Koreas too?


If the two states confederate/unionize, is there a risk that ordinary South Koreans might be turned away from traveling or doing business with other countries (simply because they *might* be doing business with NK, might be NK spies themselves, etc)?


**G)** Almost two years ago Colin Marshall, of the LA Review of Books, wrote an article about the ""Koreanization of American Politics,"" where he warned that people should look to South Korea to get a glimpse of where America is going in the future. 

http://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/the-korea-blog/anti-trump-protests-anti-park-protests-koreanization-american-politics/

Ever since then, much of what's happened in South Korea is frighteningly similar to Russia's hybrid war against the US and the EU (hyper-polarization, fake-news/foreign-propaganda, the erosion of their alliances, irregular and sometimes-illegal connections between heads of state and hostile foreign powers, etc.) 

What message would successful domination of South Korea by North Korea through union/confederation send to other countries around the world?

(Especially despotic regimes that want to ""peacefully"" subdue, or conquer, foreign enemies)

**H)** If the US and the Kim Regime can't make peace, and yet the South does (even if it means being dominated, or being used as a shield, by it), what are the chances of the US looking at South Korea and concluding ""the friend of my enemy is also my enemy""? 

Just throwing these all out there because like I said, I think union/confederation between North Korea and South Korea is a disaster in the making and potentially *the* major global-security crisis of the coming few years, and yet I can find barely any serious analysis anywhere.

https://m.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2170456/could-hong-kongs-one-country-two-systems-work-korea


Why do I describe it as a ""crisis""? Because there's very little reason to believe union/confederation will resolve the conflict, pacify the Kim Regime, soften North Korea/lead to its eventual absorption by the South or even lead to peaceful coexistence between the two states. 


On the contrary, union/confederation could (and probably would) leave South Korea dangerously exposed to North Korean infiltration, political manipulation and coercion. There's a lot of evidence and analysis that suggests Kim will take every opportunity over the following several years after reunification to try and extract money/resources from the South, wrest political powers away from it and bully it into becoming the lesser, subservient power; possibly even with the goal of one day absorbing South Korea into the North. 


(Indeed, North Korea has always seen Confederation as a possible means of ""peacefully"" conquering South Korea) 


Personally, I think Kim *might* denuclearize, but only at the cost of outside powers butting out and letting it continue to cannibalize South Korea. I think this also *could* lead to a conventional war (if, for example, South Korea resists or tries to pull out later, which may compel Kim to retaliate or attempt a hard/fast-takeover in order to keep the South from slipping from his grasp, and if SK asks the US for help after). 


Still, even if that doesn't happen, I think Kim will go the Russia-route and resort to asymmetric hybrid warfare in order to bully or manipulate South Korea into compliance; there's other ways to conquer a state besides outright military invasion.


Even if ""Korean War II"" isn't a conventional military conflict (which I've argued that it won't be), the global and regional security implications (as well as the American national security implications) are severe.


(Seriously, it's baffling why this isn't a bigger story and alarm bells aren't going off in the US public discourse) 


It's difficult to list them in any specific order, so I guess I will just use the shotgun-approach lay them all out, since it's extraordinarily difficult to find any serious predictions on how this can all turn out.


(And once again, I'm going on the assumption that union/confederation would be led and dominated by the North Koreans) 


**A)** If North Korea and South Korea reunify, would the ROK-US Alliance treaties and charters instantly become null-and-void (as well as all of the international sanctions against North Korea)? Would a ""Korean Union"" or ""Korean Federation"" or ""United States of Korea"" constitute a successor-state that is not bound by the treaties of its former constituent-states?

(I don't think there's anyway to be allies with, or to sanction, ""half of a state"" against its other half.)


**B)** Even if the US could be allies with Seoul after the deal is signed, it's difficult to see how political support for the alliance could be maintained for long.


The ROK-US Alliance was established with the goal of compelling the US to defend South Korea from a hostile North Korea. Union/Confederation might mean there won't be a ""South Korea"" for the US to defend (nor a ""North Korea to defend it from).


**C)** Would Americans determine there is no longer a point in sending US troops to Korea and pull them out? Would South Koreans determine there is no longer a point in keeping US troops in Korea and evict them?


Or would China (which has *Okay*-relations with South Korea) bear down on South Korea and force them too kick US troops out and terminate the Alliance? Right now, China only maintains decent relations with South Korea (despite hosting US troops) because they understand the threat North Korea poses to the South; it's difficult to see why they would continue tolerating US troops in South Korea once union/confederation takes place.


(Korea scholar BR Myers has stated, ""Imagine if the US military were [in Korea] *purely* as a counterweight to China...China would bring this whole peninsula to its knees in a matter of months."") 


https://soundcloud.com/war_college/north-koreas-long-game

**D)** If the US is stupid enough to maintain the ROK-US Alliance after North-South union/confederation, what risks does that pose to the US? The US and ROK militaries are deeply integrated; if North Korea were to merge with the South, how much access would that give them to US military strategy, tactics and intelligence by-proxy?

**E)** Joshua Stanton (a former US Forces Korea officer who's testified on ROK-US Alliance issues to congress written for FP, the WSJ, etc.) has said that it is no coincidence that North Korea developed its cyber-warfare capabilities at the same pace South Korea (famously) became the most wired society on earth.


http://freekorea.us/2017/12/11/korean-war-ii-a-hypothesis-explained-and-a-fisking/#sthash.ODYJ57MC.wpNt22Xv.dpbs


I think the implications are that North Korea doesn't want to nationalize or stamp out South Korea's market economy, but rather to profit off of it.


And quite possibly, exploit it for its own transnational criminal operations (drug manufacturing, arms smuggling, counterfeiting, cyber crime/terrorism, etc.)


What are the chances union/confederation will lead to, say, North Korean spy-ware on Samsung Galaxy phones? Or North Korean drugs/weapons being smuggled through South Korean ports (or maybe on Korean Air jets)?


**F)** If KJU fails to restrain himself (let's be honest; he will) and the outside world continues to feel the need to isolate and sanction him, what are the chances that will negatively impact South Koreas too?


If the two states confederate/unionize, is there a risk that ordinary South Koreans might be turned away from traveling or doing business with other countries (simply because they *might* be doing business with NK, might be NK spies themselves, etc)?


**G)** Almost two years ago Colin Marshall, of the LA Review of Books, wrote an article about the ""Koreanization of American Politics,"" where he warned that people should look to South Korea to get a glimpse of where America is going in the future. 

http://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/the-korea-blog/anti-trump-protests-anti-park-protests-koreanization-american-politics/

Ever since then, much of what's happened in South Korea is frighteningly similar to Russia's hybrid war against the US and the EU (hyper-polarization, fake-news/foreign-propaganda, the erosion of their alliances, irregular and sometimes-illegal connections between heads of state and hostile foreign powers, etc.) 

What message would successful domination of South Korea by North Korea through union/confederation send to other countries around the world?

(Especially despotic regimes that want to ""peacefully"" subdue, or conquer, foreign enemies)

**H)** If the US and the Kim Regime can't make peace, and yet the South does (even if it means being dominated, or being used as a shield, by it), what are the chances of the US looking at South Korea and concluding ""the friend of my enemy is also my enemy""? 

Just throwing these all out there because like I said, I think union/confederation between North Korea and South Korea is a disaster in the making and potentially *the* major global-security crisis of the coming few years, and yet I can find barely any serious analysis anywhere.

&#x200B;

First, the obvious thing - **the photos from the CSIS report dates back to March 2018 (they literally say so on the images), before the first inter-Korean summit in 2018 even occurred.**  Most if not all of North Korea's token overtures about de-nuclearization occurred AFTER the Panmunjom Declaration (April 27 2018). **For that matter, it was not until the SEPTEMBER 2018 Pyeongyang Joint Statement that Kim Jong Un even gave an official promise to explicitly not conduct nuclear or missile tests - Kim has kept his promise to Trump so far (surprisingly)**.

&#x200B;

Missile Base Photos from CSIS - **March 29, 2018**

1st summit between North & South Korea in over a decade - **April 27, 2018**.

Trump - Kim Summit - **June 12, 2018**.

&#x200B;

Trump and Kim didn't even meet at the time that the photos for the missile bases were taken. In fact, North Korea and South Korea didn't even have their first summit for the Panmunjom Statement back then.

&#x200B;

More importantly however, **in both of the November 2018 CSIS reports that the New York Times refers to, the main specifics in the reports are almost completely based on supposition and lacks any recent data or sources - most of their source references date back to the 1990s, for god's sake. So why is a report largely based on references from 20 years ago being used to tie in with Trump's foreign policy, who's only been president since 2017?** There was only 1 article from 2018, and that was the article "" North Korean Missile Base Shows Operational Focus,” from Jane's. Except this is stating the obvious - of course North Korea would maintain operational missile capability; missiles are North Korea's only viable deterrence against the USA given America's past history of regime changes (cough Gaddafi cough), and North Korea hasn't even promised to dismantle its ballistic missile program in any of the 2018 Joint Statements.

Here are the links to the CSIS reports below - please, go take a look at their source reference footnotes and their dates:

&#x200B;

**And finally, perhaps the most laughable thing about this is the fact that THE REGION OF SAKKANMOL WAS A KNOWN MISSILE SITE YEARS BEFORE THE CSIS REPORT.**

&#x200B;

**In the past couple of decades, there have been multiple instances where missiles were fired from the region around Sakkanmol, enough so that back in no later than 2016 - over 2 years ago - there were NEWS ARTICLES pointing out Sakkanmol as a site for missile bases.** The link for proof is below - it's in Korean though, so I'll translate the relevant paragraph.

[https://news.joins.com/article/20329452](https://news.joins.com/article/20329452)

Does this look familiar? They were taken at the area presumed to be a missile base in Sakkanmol. You know, the one that CSIS discovered from March 29 2018 photos - except **even Google beat them by a year**.

&#x200B;

**The fact that one of the authors of the reports is Victor Cha should tell you something -  Victor was the man behind G.W. Bush's foreign policy towards North Korea, i.e. he was the jackass who couldn't predict shit and basically twiddled his thumbs while allowing North Korea to go fully nuclear**. Victor Cha is to North Korea what Donald Rumsfeld is to the Iraq War - during his tenure under the Bush administration, Victor had made no serious attempt to really militarily pressure North Korea (having bombers fly over doesn't count since everyone before him did too), no real attempt to address North Korea's nuclear progress in spite of sanctions, etc.

&#x200B;

There's a more detailed criticism about the recent hype about the report from CSIS, except it's a Korean article. If you have the time, I recommend reading the link below - I'd translate it, but this post itself is already getting too long. I personally think that this news media is at times bit more left wing that I like, but the arguments made are valid.

**All this recent report does is basically regurgitate something that's already been known.

aa5ksr,A geopolitical strategy for South Korea,A geopolitical strategy for South Korea,"South Korea is the 11th largest economy of the world and has a fair level of autonomy in political and military affairs. It is the only country - among so many other former colonies liberated after WW2 - to have achieved first world status. We have a population of over 50 million and we have an evenly distributed economy encompassing heavy industry and IT start-ups. Now, our competition with North Korea, which haunted 2 generations before me (I'm in my 30s), is over. We overwhelm North Korea in every dimension and there is absolutely no chance that South Korea would be invaded and conquered by North Korea. It is like comparing the power of US and Mexico. We know that, and they know that too. Hence, the nukes. North Korea's nuclear arsenal is the only credible threat(or deterrent) to South Korea and that is why they are reluctant to give them up. However, I do not consider North Korea as an existential threat. They are just a risk which must be managed accordingly, something like diabetes. You cannot get rid of it but you can manage it. 

On the other hand, the true existential threat to South Korea is China, its colossal neighbor. China's ambition is grander in scale and scope and their concern is domination, not survival (which is the case of North Korea). It is no secret that they want to re-establish its dominant role in East Asia as in those days of the Qing dynasty or the Ming dynasty and we South Koreans are resolute in preventing that from happening. China's power is growing day by day and now it has become the undisputed rival of the United States. Never has the US faced a similar rival in its entire history. China's economy already dwarfs that of the USSR at its height and is now a very formidable power in most dimensions. Therefore, I view Trump's approach on China rather favorably. Yet, the US is not omnipotent so it must have focus and select priorities. In this light, I believe the US should reach a compromise with Russia. Even Stephen Kotkin seems to advocate such action. Russia is no longer a credible threat to US power. Its economy is but 1/15 of America's. It can barely assert its power beyond Ukraine. Central Asia which has traditionally been under Russia's influence, is being taken away by China. Stephen Kotkin has once remarked that Russia was almost a Chinese colony. He even went further by saying ""should Russia crumble, Hungary would have a border with China.""  I am pretty much sure that Putin does not want to become a vassal of China and that he is proud of being Russian and its cultural heritage. 

So what does all this have to do with South Korea? First, China must be contained but its focus should be driven away from the Korean peninsula. Second, to that end, South Korea must reach a compromise with North Korea and bring it to the modern world. Third, South Korea must help Russia to develop economically as well as socially so that it can become another bulwark to contain China. South Korea is the only major economy which does not pose a geopolitical threat to Russia. We enjoy cordial relations and Russia is viewed favorably by many Koreans as well. Tourism to Vladivostok has skyrocketed during the last 3 years and Koreans are eager to invest in Russia. Many Russians are coming to South Korea for medical reasons too (South Korea has one of the most efficient and professional medical sector in the world).  Furthermore, if we could lay pipelines to import Russian gas, it will be a huge win-win for both countries. It would be a major benefit in geopolitical sense too, since it will serve as a restraining tool for North Korea's behavior. For example, North Korea may decide to cut off the pipeline at any moment but if they do that, they should expect Russia's wrath coming. And let's not forget that they have a land border with Russia. 

But in order to bring North Korea and Russia to our side, we need to convince the US to alleviate a number of sanctions imposed on both countries. None of them are a geopolitical threat to US primacy in world affairs. The only credible rival to US power is China. There is an old proverb in East Asia which goes as follows: ""遠交近攻""(Make friends with those afar, and attack those near). It is a natural diplomatic instinct to ally a great power beyond our borders to counter balance another great power just right next door. Fear of China is what could align North Korea, Russia and South Korea to US leadership. South Korea is an ally of the US already but Russia and North Korea are not and they have their own exclusive interests. NK's is survival and Russia's is influence in Ukraine and central Asia. I believe those are negotiable interests. 

South Korea's geopolitical interests can only be achieved through an amicable network with several players. The KOR-US alliance is the body and a stronger and friendly relation with North Korea and Russia should become its right arm and left arm accordingly.

Yes, the US military can probably win a military victory against North Korea, however I think tables will turn if China starts supporting the North Koreans.

al9xim,The case for Russian engagement in the Korean peninsula,The case for Russian engagement in the Korean peninsula,"The case for Russian engagement in the Korean peninsula

Submission Statement:

Russia is today a ""former"" great power trying to restore its past glory. Yet, they are hindered by demographic, economic and political difficulties which are hard to overcome. They are aging fast, they are dying fast and they have enemies everywhere. Some western analysts are saying that China and Russia are getting closer than ever, and that it is a big threat which needs to be addressed. They are correct to a certain degree. But they need to realize that Russia is actually more afraid of China than Europe or the USA. They share a massive land-border and if Russia fails to modernize its economy, they will become essentially a vassal state to China. The recent Sino-Russian alignment is nothing but the result of immediate concerns and has no solid foundation. The real big player and threat is China. Therefore, I would like to argue that Russia must be lured to our side by providing her with tangible benefits, and Korea could play a key role in making that happen. 

First, it is necessary to note that the ""Korean Question"" is one of the most crucial flashpoints in East Asia. North Korea must be restrained but they won't unless they get something in return. However, last year has been a phase of great pacification by giving momentum to diplomacy and negotiations. Now, the US and North Korea are vying for some kind of compromise. In the process, South Korea has repeatedly advocated for a Russian engagement. We have made explicit our plans for railroads and pipelines. So, what does this mean?

South Korea is the second largest importer of natural gas in the world. Russia needs to diversify its customer base. They are almost entirely relying on Western Europe and their relations are sour at best. South Korea can provide cash for oil/gas and we can invest in Russia to build factories and create jobs. On the other hand, Korea can make its industry more competitive by lowering energy costs and therefore generating more wealth for the country. Should South Korea become richer and stronger, we could afford to pay more for US forces and we could buy more US weapons.

South Korea can serve as a gateway for Russia for foreign markets too. Russia's Far East will have more jobs and more factories, more goods. We will bring them via railway to our markets and we can re-export them to the outer world. 

If Russia gets a regular continous and reliable source of income by establishing closer connection with South Korea, by having North Korea as a road, then Russia will have more than enough incentives to restrain North Korea's behavior. Russia has a land-border with North Korea, and Russia has the willpower to engage militarily if a third-rate power crosses in their path. 

A Russo-Korean (South) cooperation with the benediction of the US will serve as a good encircling web against China. It will enrich South Korea, it will enrich (to a certain degree) Russia and reduce their dependency of China, it will restrain North Korea by making them content to have a rent revenue. All the parties involved would be satisfied and reduce the risks of armed conflict. Therefore, I'd argue that South Korea needs a new Nordpolitik focusing on Russia, and that the US/EU should seek a rapprochement with Russia to counterbalance the immense threat that China poses to the whole world.

The recent Sino-Russian alignment is nothing but the result of immediate concerns and has no solid foundation. The real big player and threat is China.

Submission Statement:

Russia is today a ""former"" great power trying to restore its past glory. Yet, they are hindered by demographic, economic and political difficulties which are hard to overcome. They are aging fast, they are dying fast and they have enemies everywhere. Some western analysts are saying that China and Russia are getting closer than ever, and that it is a big threat which needs to be addressed. They are correct to a certain degree. But they need to realize that Russia is actually more afraid of China than Europe or the USA. They share a massive land-border and if Russia fails to modernize its economy, they will become essentially a vassal state to China. The recent Sino-Russian alignment is nothing but the result of immediate concerns and has no solid foundation. The real big player and threat is China. Therefore, I would like to argue that Russia must be lured to our side by providing her with tangible benefits, and Korea could play a key role in making that happen.

First, it is necessary to note that the ""Korean Question"" is one of the most crucial flashpoints in East Asia. North Korea must be restrained but they won't unless they get something in return. However, last year has been a phase of great pacification by giving momentum to diplomacy and negotiations. Now, the US and North Korea are vying for some kind of compromise. In the process, South Korea has repeatedly advocated for a Russian engagement. We have made explicit our plans for railroads and pipelines. So, what does this mean?

South Korea is the second largest importer of natural gas in the world. Russia needs to diversify its customer base. They are almost entirely relying on Western Europe and their relations are sour at best. South Korea can provide cash for oil/gas and we can invest in Russia to build factories and create jobs. On the other hand, Korea can make its industry more competitive by lowering energy costs and therefore generating more wealth for the country. Should South Korea become richer and stronger, we could afford to pay more for US forces and we could buy more US weapons.

South Korea can serve as a gateway for Russia for foreign markets too. Russia's Far East will have more jobs and more factories, more goods. We will bring them via railway to our markets and we can re-export them to the outer world.

If Russia gets a regular continous and reliable source of income by establishing closer connection with South Korea, by having North Korea as a road, then Russia will have more than enough incentives to restrain North Korea's behavior. Russia has a land-border with North Korea, and Russia has the willpower to engage militarily if a third-rate power crosses in their path.

A Russo-Korean (South) cooperation with the benediction of the US will serve as a good encircling web against China. It will enrich South Korea, it will enrich (to a certain degree) Russia and reduce their dependency of China, it will restrain North Korea by making them content to have a rent revenue. All the parties involved would be satisfied and reduce the risks of armed conflict. Therefore, I'd argue that South Korea needs a new Nordpolitik focusing on Russia, and that the US/EU should seek a rapprochement with Russia to counterbalance the immense threat that China poses to the whole world.",0.1435939222574234,0.7958825826644897,0.0605235062539577,-0.0830704122781753,-0.0830704122781753,THREAT,0.8,"게시글에서 러시아와 중국의 관계가 위협으로 간주되고 있으며, 이를 해결해야 한다는 언급이 있어 군사적 위협의 가능성이 강조되고 있다."

bddjn6,The case for a small-deal approach towards North Korea,The case for a small-deal approach towards North Korea,"The last Hanoi summit ended in a debacle, with neither side gaining anything from the other. Nevertheless, contrary to expectations, the relationship between president Trump and chairman Kim remained cordial. Under normal circumstances, we would have expected fire and fury and threats of nuclear armaggedon all over again, but both decided to remain calm and leave at least some breathing space for more negotiations. Of course, Team Trump is still resolute on having a ""BIG DEAL"" and Team Kim is adamant about giving up all its nuclear arsenal. So the gap is still wide and it is hard to reach a settlement, for now. In order to break the stalemate and move foward, a small-deal, however small it may be, must be reached to begin a ""process"" which will finally deliver a functioning modus vivendi for the peninsula and the parties involved. 

The reason are as follows:

(1) ***The current stalemate cannot last forever, time will eventually run out and the US will not be able to respond.*** Kim Jong-un will feel compelled to renew his provocations if he feels humiliated (or if he feels pressured to act) and the US will feel compelled to retaliate if such thing were to happen. However, this time, the US will not have the support of key players in the region, such as China or Russia, and more importantly South Korea. Fire and fury threats worked once, but it cannot work twice. Back then, China and Russia were compliant to US demands, and the UN passed resolutions which put maximum pressure in place. But since it has become apparent that Team Trump is not the Mad-man it pretended to be, China and Russia will not be willing to cooperate with the US. Moreover, given the increasing tensions between the US/China and US/Russia, there is little reason for either country to do something in favor of the US. Actually, they are already violating the sanctions they themselves have agreed upon, and that is completely understandable from the view of Realpolitik. 

(2)***A complete breakdown of negotiations between the US and NK is *REALLY* dangerous.*** The recent overtures from NK as well as the US for more cordiality and dialogue is unprecedented and has increased expectations to an astonishing degree. But when you fall from high, you get hit harder. In this case, the US will not be affected very much from negotiations being torn apart, but KJU will certainly be. His reputation within the regime will be hurt, and he will be encircled by hardliners. Even dictators or kings of a dynasty cannot act freely and they are prisoners of their own regime, having limited scope of action. The working logic of the regime demands that he has to show action should negotiations fail. That by itself is a danger for the Korean peninsula. Even if KJU may be reluctant to take offensive action, he has to do something to perserve his prestige and legitimacy within the regime, and that may incite a vicious cycle of tit for tat which may end in a catastrophe. 

(3) ***The US cannot handle tensions in all fronts at the same time.*** the US has alienated most of the world already, in a feat of bravado or sheer stupidity. US-China, US-EU, US-Russia, US-Iran, and the list goes on and on. It is time to make more friends and less enemies. However, the US is creating more enemies in an unprecedented pace, and the relative position of the US vis-a-vis the world is weaker than ever before. Today is not like the heydays of post-WW2 world, when the US controlled over 50 percent of the global GDP. The US cannot make the world in its image or control the outcome of every political incident in the world. The same holds true for the North Korean crisis, and the US should better accommodate a little in order to maintain stability in the region. 

(4) ***North Korea is not an existential threat to the US nor South Korea.*** North Korea's entire annual budget is less than a provincial city of South Korea. Its army, though impressive on paper, is but a decrepit corpse which relies on theft and pillage to survive, no better than the Red army during the early days of the Soviet revolution. They are more like a bandits and cossacks rather than a regular professional army. The only real capability which poses a threat to South Korea and its allies are its WMDs, and they know that they will be annihilated if they use them. But if they are put in an extreme position, that of a dead-end, they may attempt a suicide attack. Of course, such a scenario can be prevented if we give them an alternative and a breathing space, for their ultimate goal is survival as any other state. 

(5) ***A small deal, however small it may be, is conducive to peace and stability.*** North Korea may cheat and may retain a fraction of its nuclear capabiltiies, but it is better to have them under international inspections rather than no inspection at all (And they have agreed to an international inspection). It is better to dismantle Yongbyeon than not closing them at all. A small deal, just small enough to save face for NK and the US will mark not an end of negotiations but the start of a process which will enable more regular contacts and that will create a modus vivendi for the parties involved. Step by step, NK will get what they want, and the US/SK will get what they want, thus creating a cycle for mutually beneficial deals. 

(6) ***Strategically speaking, it is also in the American interest to engage productively with North Korea, because otherwise they will feel compelled to align completely with China and Russia***, thus creating again the old cold war blocs. And this is already happening, just after the Hanoi debacle. North Korea must not become a Chinese or Russian lackey and they should remain a buffer, as they have always been, and preferably they should be under our influence, rather than Chinese or Russian.","The last Hanoi summit ended in a debacle, with neither side gaining anything from the other.

In order to break the stalemate and move foward, a small-deal, however small it may be, must be reached to begin a ""process"" which will finally deliver a functioning modus vivendi for the peninsula and the parties involved. The reason are as follows 1 The current stalemate cannot last forever, time will eventually run out and the US will not be able to respond. Kim Jong-un will feel compelled to renew his provocations if he feels humiliated or if he feels pressured to act and the US will feel compelled to retaliate if such thing were to happen. However, this time, the US will not have the support of key players in the region, such as China or Russia, and more importantly South Korea. Fire and fury threats worked once, but it cannot work twice. Back then, China and Russia were compliant to US demands, and the UN passed resolutions which put maximum pressure in place. But since it has become apparent that Team Trump is not the Mad-man it pretended to be, China and Russia will not be willing to cooperate with the US. Moreover, given the increasing tensions between the US China and US Russia, there is little reason for either country to do something in favor of the US. Actually, they are already violating the sanctions they themselves have agreed upon, and that is completely understandable from the view of Realpolitik. 2 A complete breakdown of negotiations between the US and NK is REALLY dangerous. The recent overtures from NK as well as the US for more cordiality and dialogue is unprecedented and has increased expectations to an astonishing degree. But when you fall from high, you get hit harder. In this case, the US will not be affected very much from negotiations being torn apart, but KJU will certainly be. His reputation within the regime will be hurt, and he will be encircled by hardliners. Even dictators or kings of a dynasty cannot act freely and they are prisoners of their own regime, having limited scope of action. The working logic of the regime demands that he has to show action should negotiations fail. That by itself is a danger for the Korean peninsula. Even if KJU may be reluctant to take offensive action, he has to do something to perserve his prestige and legitimacy within the regime, and that may incite a vicious cycle of tit for tat which may end in a catastrophe. 3 The US cannot handle tensions in all fronts at the same time. the US has alienated most of the world already, in a feat of bravado or sheer stupidity. US-China, US-EU, US-Russia, US-Iran, and the list goes on and on. It is time to make more friends and less enemies. However, the US is creating more enemies in an unprecedented pace, and the relative position of the US vis-a-vis the world is weaker than ever before. Today is not like the heydays of post-WW2 world, when the US controlled over 50 percent of the global GDP. The US cannot make the world in its image or control the outcome of every political incident in the world. The same holds true for the North Korean crisis, and the US should better accommodate a little in order to maintain stability in the region. 4 North Korea is not an existential threat to the US nor South Korea. North Korea's entire annual budget is less than a provincial city of South Korea. Its army, though impressive on paper, is but a decrepit corpse which relies on theft and pillage to survive, no better than the Red army during the early days of the Soviet revolution. They are more like a bandits and cossacks rather than a regular professional army. The only real capability which poses a threat to South Korea and its allies are its WMDs, and they know that they will be annihilated if they use them. But if they are put in an extreme position, that of a dead-end, they may attempt a suicide attack. Of course, such a scenario can be prevented if we give them an alternative and a breathing space, for their ultimate goal is survival as any other state. 5 A small deal, however small it may be, is conducive to peace and stability. North Korea may cheat and may retain a fraction of its nuclear capabiltiies, but it is better to have them under international inspections rather than no inspection at all And they have agreed to an international inspection . It is better to dismantle Yongbyeon than not closing them at all. A small deal, just small enough to save face for NK and the US will mark not an end of negotiations but the start of a process which will enable more regular contacts and that will create a modus vivendi for the parties involved. Step by step, NK will get what they want, and the US SK will get what they want, thus creating a cycle for mutually beneficial deals. 6 Strategically speaking, it is also in the American interest to engage productively with North Korea, because otherwise they will feel compelled to align completely with China and Russia , thus creating again the old cold war blocs. And this is already happening, just after the Hanoi debacle. North Korea must not become a Chinese or Russian lackey and they should remain a buffer, as they have always been, and preferably they should be under our influence, rather than Chinese or Russian.","The case for a small-deal approach towards North Korea The last Hanoi summit ended in a debacle, with neither side gaining anything from the other.

[First place.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/41°46'41.0%22N+129°49'46.9%22E/@41.7780508,129.8281534,467m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d41.7780477!4d129.829687)

The first place at least does not look ice bound, while the second does (map info is apparently 2019, so probably winter). Apart from the ice at the second place, in neither place does it look like the boats could go anywhere soon--how long would it take to get those boats out of such a crammed up situation? It would have to take days.

[Wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongjin#Prisons) that Chongjin was hit hard by the '90s famine, that it has some prisons and a re-education camp, and that shipping is important.

Just SW of the second place, there appears to be a larger port, with only a few larger ships (and some smaller one). Also, there appear to be some rail lines leading over there, so that is probably where the 'shipping' takes place. 

The first and second places, above, appear tome to be fishing boats, stored away for some reason.

c865ad,Why the US does not want North Korea and Iran to have nukes,Why the US does not want North Korea and Iran to have nukes,"North Korea and Iran are on the news for their nuclear ambitions. Iran is on the way to having the capability and North Korea is on its way to have a working ICBM. It is cited they are they using it for deterence, to prevent their nation from collapse by an outside power. Critics of US policy has cited nuclear weapons are for defense against the US, and the US has nothing to worry about.

However, the US has constantly provoked North Korea and the tensions got so high it almost amounted to war. Why is this? Why does the US fear third rate powers with nukes? The answer is it defeats the Flexible Response doctrine of the US. Typically US military is there to counter top powers like the Soviet Union. The US uses a system called ""Flexible Response"" to counter both nuclear and conventional threats. It also suscribes to ""proportional respond"" to defend its allies. If the enemy uses conventional forces, the reponse is conventional response back, if nukes the US will use nukes.

Take US v China on Taiwan. If US does get in a war where China is using conventional weapons, US could win(likely) with its 10 carriers, thousands of fighters, nuclear submarines and better tech. If China were tip to scale using tactical nuclear weapons, US could respond by hitting non-city Chinese targets, with its more warheads. US has more missile defenses, more carriers that can hide and move, and intel assets, so even in a non-city nuclear war US could come out of top with both sides bloodied. A total strategic nuclear war, it would be Mutually Assured Destructuction, but I doubt China will give its cities for Taiwan.

Now this is the doctrine against a power like China or Russia. But enter North Korea with an ICBM and everything changes. North Korea is just as capable of defeating US static targets like military bases in Asia with its medium range nuclear missile force. Without ICBMs with answer was easy, take out North Korea completly(including city targets with nukes or overwhelming conventional superiority). However with an ICBM, North Korea could destroy US cities. With an ICBM, North Korea using its medium range missile destroying major US bases will cripple US capability on the Pacific and the US would be limited to restrained retaliation. US can't destroy Pyongyang and topple the regime without getting LA and New York getting nuked. It could nuke the North Korean military bases, but that won't topple the regime, just contain North Korea and beat back its military from taking the South. US military would still be bloodied after a Phyric victory, used a lot of its nukes on a rather insignifcant nation...and now China is possibly much stronger and could be possibly on parity with US capability.

&#x200B;

This is why US doesn't want such a insignificant power to get nukes. It is very imbalance of power. So why would North Korea risk such a move? Well in the US mind, beligerents are not rational, and would take huge risks even with a high chance of losing.(Japan, Germany, Saddam etc). North Korea may use its nukes to say ""give up South Korea or your Pacific military will be crippled by nukes"". Just like how Saddam planned to US surrender by fighting a bloody battle where the US civilian populace would give up(it didn't happen thanks to US conventional superiority)

So what could the US do? Well the answer now is Missile Defense. The problem is that it is not a 100 percent defense, but it may be able to save major military bases against the Medium range threat,(ie. THAAD)while new interepotrs in Alaska can stop the ICBM threat. North Korea doesn't have a working ICBM yet, hopefully US tests would be make Missile Defense good enough in time. US would be putting Missile Defense in Europe to defend against Russia. However, Iran has no ICBM yet, so that is less of a threat.","North Korea and Iran are on the news for their nuclear ambitions.

The answer is it defeats the Flexible Response doctrine of the US. Typically US military is there to counter top powers like the Soviet Union. The US uses a system called ""Flexible Response"" to counter both nuclear and conventional threats. It also suscribes to ""proportional respond"" to defend its allies. If the enemy uses conventional forces, the reponse is conventional response back, if nukes the US will use nukes. Take US v China on Taiwan. If US does get in a war where China is using conventional weapons, US could win likely with its 10 carriers, thousands of fighters, nuclear submarines and better tech. If China were tip to scale using tactical nuclear weapons, US could respond by hitting non-city Chinese targets, with its more warheads. US has more missile defenses, more carriers that can hide and move, and intel assets, so even in a non-city nuclear war US could come out of top with both sides bloodied. A total strategic nuclear war, it would be Mutually Assured Destructuction, but I doubt China will give its cities for Taiwan. Now this is the doctrine against a power like China or Russia. But enter North Korea with an ICBM and everything changes. North Korea is just as capable of defeating US static targets like military bases in Asia with its medium range nuclear missile force. Without ICBMs with answer was easy, take out North Korea completly including city targets with nukes or overwhelming conventional superiority . However with an ICBM, North Korea could destroy US cities. With an ICBM, North Korea using its medium range missile destroying major US bases will cripple US capability on the Pacific and the US would be limited to restrained retaliation. US can't destroy Pyongyang and topple the regime without getting LA and New York getting nuked. It could nuke the North Korean military bases, but that won't topple the regime, just contain North Korea and beat back its military from taking the South. US military would still be bloodied after a Phyric victory, used a lot of its nukes on a rather insignifcant nation...and now China is possibly much stronger and could be possibly on parity with US capability. x200B This is why US doesn't want such a insignificant power to get nukes. It is very imbalance of power. So why would North Korea risk such a move? Well in the US mind, beligerents are not rational, and would take huge risks even with a high chance of losing. Japan, Germany, Saddam etc . North Korea may use its nukes to say ""give up South Korea or your Pacific military will be crippled by nukes"". Just like how Saddam planned to US surrender by fighting a bloody battle where the US civilian populace would give up it didn't happen thanks to US conventional superiority So what could the US do? Well the answer now is Missile Defense. The problem is that it is not a 100 percent defense, but it may be able to save major military bases against the Medium range threat, ie. THAAD while new interepotrs in Alaska can stop the ICBM threat. North Korea doesn't have a working ICBM yet, hopefully US tests would be make Missile Defense good enough in time. US would be putting Missile Defense in Europe to defend against Russia.

I'll admit I have not been following this, so here's my elementary layman's take:

The [1965 treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_Basic_Relations_between_Japan_and_the_Republic_of_Korea) was supposed to normalize all ties and settle all issues of compensation between Japan and Korea (Japan paid $300 million). Thus I do not see why South Korea is owed additional compensation for wartime crimes that happened 80 years ago. Japan has already apologized and paid reparations to Korea, why does Korea still think it's owed more? Wasn't this issue officially settled already by the treaty? At what point does this end?

But all that being said, I do not see how starting a trade war is a good move on Japan's part. Korea will surely retaliate with its own trade restrictions against Japan, seek to purchase those materials elsewhere and develop their own way to source/manufacture these materials, and Japan will likely be worse off in the long run. Korea isn't some insignificant developing country, they are the world's leading producer of memory chips with companies like Samsung, I don't see the benefit here in starting a trade war.

I just don't see the rationale here for Japan. I'm just guessing here, but I'd wager that most Japanese citizens probably don't support these export restrictions, or honestly even care about Korea's constant apology/reparation demands for war crimes that happened 80 years ago that were supposed to be settled in 1965.

I'm just guessing here, but I'd wager that most Japanese citizens probably don't support these export restrictions, or honestly even care about Korea's constant apology/reparation demands for war crimes that happened 80 years ago that were supposed to be settled in 1965.

ch1x85,(Perspective) South Korea's quest for a new role in the world.,Perspective South Korea's quest for a new role in the world.,"South Korea, once a war-torn country, poorer than most African nations, is today one of the wealthiest nations in the world. Although there was a time when it was ruled by a military junta, after several years of struggle and protests, South Korea is today a *thriving liberal democracy*. Writings of the French enlightenment and American emancipation are widely taught at universities and books about world history (Yuval Harari, Jared Diamond, Peter Frankopan, etc) and geopolitics (George Friedman, Peter Zeihan, etc) are widely popular. Big companies like Samsung and Hyundai are national champions and all of the country, including the most remote areas, is fully covered with fast-speed WiFi. In short, South Korea is the most successful offspring of the post-WW2 settlement. 

However, South Korea is surrounded by the greatest powers in the world: China, Russia, Japan and of course North Korea (although nobody would call NK a great power)*. It is located in the worst possible geopolitical location and it must confront a very hard reality. China aims to recover its hegemony over East Asia, Japan aims to curtail South Korea's rise and has difficulties in acknowledging and expressing remorse over its past deeds, North Korea is always behaving as a spoiled kid and Russia is distant and far-away (and cooperates with China in a number of cases). In such precarious a situation, South Korea's only reliable ally is the United States and this has served well for 70 years already. 

Now, despite Trump's aggressiveness and lunacy, South Korea enjoys a superb and privileged relationship with the US. That is because our interests are aligned. Trump wants to get diplomatic scores in NK and South Korea wants to normalize relations with NK to open up trade. Currently, South Korea is pursuing a very assertive economic diplomacy with a number of key partners. In February, there was a  summit with UAE and we signed a number of agreements to develop infrastructure. In June, there was a summit with MBS of Saudi Arabia and we signed agreements to secure oil and further investment. This July, we had a summit with Israel and we agreed to deepen cooperation in the sector of A.I. In sum, South Korea has had high level meetings with the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Israel thereby reducing its dependence on Iranian oil or Iranian markets. 

Furthermore, South Korea is discussing with the US for a *possible expedition to the strait of Hormuz* and the likelihood of agreement is very high. Even Korean leftists (who were considered to be anti-American) largely agree that we must align ourselves with the US to counter not only China but Japan. So domestic opposition for a possible foreign expedition is negligible. On top of that, yesterday, South Korea *opened fire to a Russian aircraft which violated Korean airspace* (Over the Dokdo/Takeshima Island). It is the *first time that South Korea opened fire to a foreign aircraft since the Korean War*. In doing so, South Korea demonstrated *its resolve to protect its sovereignty* and also that it had *real and effective jurisdiction over the disputed Island*. It also showed to the world that it is a force which should be reckoned with. However, it has no significant issues with Russia, and it enjoys a very cordial relationship with Russia. Russia knows this, and they are also trying to de-escalate the incident and turning it into a non-issue. 

South Korea is also negotiating a possible trade deal with the UK (in case it drops out of the EU), and it has proclaimed a Southern policy focused in fostering and improving ties with Southeast Asian nations. This policy is compatible with US led Indo-Pacific strategy and South Korea may also play part as a bridge between the US led order and the Chinese led Belt and Road. In order to do that, South Korea needs first a peaceful and cooperative relation with North Korea, open it up for investment and trade. Once that first step is completed, South Korea may be able to become a new geopolitical player which must be taken into account.","South Korea, once a war-torn country, poorer than most African nations, is today one of the wealthiest nations in the world.

Although there was a time when it was ruled by a military junta, after several years of struggle and protests, South Korea is today a thriving liberal democracy . Writings of the French enlightenment and American emancipation are widely taught at universities and books about world history Yuval Harari, Jared Diamond, Peter Frankopan, etc and geopolitics George Friedman, Peter Zeihan, etc are widely popular. Big companies like Samsung and Hyundai are national champions and all of the country, including the most remote areas, is fully covered with fast-speed WiFi. In short, South Korea is the most successful offspring of the post-WW2 settlement. However, South Korea is surrounded by the greatest powers in the world China, Russia, Japan and of course North Korea although nobody would call NK a great power . It is located in the worst possible geopolitical location and it must confront a very hard reality. China aims to recover its hegemony over East Asia, Japan aims to curtail South Korea's rise and has difficulties in acknowledging and expressing remorse over its past deeds, North Korea is always behaving as a spoiled kid and Russia is distant and far-away and cooperates with China in a number of cases . In such precarious a situation, South Korea's only reliable ally is the United States and this has served well for 70 years already. Now, despite Trump's aggressiveness and lunacy, South Korea enjoys a superb and privileged relationship with the US. That is because our interests are aligned. Trump wants to get diplomatic scores in NK and South Korea wants to normalize relations with NK to open up trade. Currently, South Korea is pursuing a very assertive economic diplomacy with a number of key partners. In February, there was a summit with UAE and we signed a number of agreements to develop infrastructure. In June, there was a summit with MBS of Saudi Arabia and we signed agreements to secure oil and further investment. This July, we had a summit with Israel and we agreed to deepen cooperation in the sector of A.I. In sum, South Korea has had high level meetings with the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Israel thereby reducing its dependence on Iranian oil or Iranian markets. Furthermore, South Korea is discussing with the US for a possible expedition to the strait of Hormuz and the likelihood of agreement is very high. Even Korean leftists who were considered to be anti-American largely agree that we must align ourselves with the US to counter not only China but Japan. So domestic opposition for a possible foreign expedition is negligible. On top of that, yesterday, South Korea opened fire to a Russian aircraft which violated Korean airspace Over the Dokdo Takeshima Island . It is the first time that South Korea opened fire to a foreign aircraft since the Korean War . In doing so, South Korea demonstrated its resolve to protect its sovereignty and also that it had real and effective jurisdiction over the disputed Island . It also showed to the world that it is a force which should be reckoned with. However, it has no significant issues with Russia, and it enjoys a very cordial relationship with Russia. Russia knows this, and they are also trying to de-escalate the incident and turning it into a non-issue. South Korea is also negotiating a possible trade deal with the UK in case it drops out of the EU , and it has proclaimed a Southern policy focused in fostering and improving ties with Southeast Asian nations. This policy is compatible with US led Indo-Pacific strategy and South Korea may also play part as a bridge between the US led order and the Chinese led Belt and Road. In order to do that, South Korea needs first a peaceful and cooperative relation with North Korea, open it up for investment and trade.

About 10-14 minutes depending on who you ask.

And if you were to have read/watched the Japanese news media reporting on this, many of them took time to write/talk about this in detail, with many TV commentators remarking that this shows that Japan manage to get intel about North Korea just fine without South Korea.

That's not the case in reality. It's the opposite; **Japan had no tangible intel about the launch itself on its own and asked South Korea for assistance.**

As reported by KBS - [link here](https://news.v.daum.net/v/20190824210821899) - the article states that the South Korean Ministry of Defense **noticed the missile launch before Japan, but took a little over 10 minutes to give the news was because it was analyzing the missile launch with the US military about the details** (speed, trajectory, altitude, etc.)

>발사 사실은 우리가 먼저 인지했지만 미군 당국과 분석을 진행하는 사이 일본이 서둘러 발표한 겁니다.

In other words, Japan reported first, but it knew nothing tangible about it. This is the most important part in missile defense, because **knowing things like speed, altitude, trajectory of the missile is what allows you to pinpoint its location and intercept the missile; just KNOWING that the missile launched is pointless.** If you don't know its speed, how can your ABMs intercept the missile in time? If you don't know its altitude, how can you even identify the missile's location? The questions go on and on.

The article also states that South Korea acquiesced to share the intel with Japan because the GSOMIA still technically active until it hits the expiration date; the decision made by the Moon administration is to not renew it and allow it to expire.

Of course, there are those who might argue that this might be a lie because it came from a Korean news source, so **I took the liberty of bringing a Japanese news source as well:**

The English version of the Kyodo News reports the [following - click here for link:](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2019/08/bafa27d9c5c8-urgent-n-korea-appears-to-have-fired-ballistic-missile.html)

>The missiles, fired at 6:45 a.m. and 7:02 a.m., flew about 380 kilometers at a top speed of Mach 6.5 and reached a maximum altitude of about 97 km, **Yonhap News Agency quoted the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff as saying.**

Prior to the ROK government announcing the specs of the missile launch, NO Japanese media had reported on the exact speed, range, altitude, and duration of the missile. In fact, if you use google, you can use the search engine and check how many hours ago each news link was posted. And when you do, you'll see that Japanese media did not post anything tangible about the missile launch before the details came out from South Korea.

The Kyodo News also confirms that yes, Japan DID request missile intel to South Korea.

>The South Korean JCS said it intends to share intelligence on the latest North Korean missile launches with Japan upon **Tokyo's request.**


I'll stop here, since I think this speaks for itself about who REALLY needs GSOMIA the most. But I'll leave behind one last commentary made by the KBS reporter in the aforementioned link above:

This is the most important part in missile defense, because **knowing things like speed, altitude, trajectory of the missile is what allows you to pinpoint its location and intercept the missile; just KNOWING that the missile launched is pointless.** If you don't know its speed, how can your ABMs intercept the missile in time? If you don't know its altitude, how can you even identify the missile's location? The questions go on and on.

The article also states that South Korea acquiesced to share the intel with Japan because the GSOMIA still technically active until it hits the expiration date; the decision made by the Moon administration is to not renew it and allow it to expire.

Of course, there are those who might argue that this might be a lie because it came from a Korean news source, so **I took the liberty of bringing a Japanese news source as well:**

The English version of the Kyodo News reports the [following - click here for link:](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2019/08/bafa27d9c5c8-urgent-n-korea-appears-to-have-fired-ballistic-missile.html)

>The missiles, fired at 6:45 a.m. and 7:02 a.m., flew about 380 kilometers at a top speed of Mach 6.5 and reached a maximum altitude of about 97 km, **Yonhap News Agency quoted the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff as saying.**

Prior to the ROK government announcing the specs of the missile launch, NO Japanese media had reported on the exact speed, range, altitude, and duration of the missile. In fact, if you use google, you can use the search engine and check how many hours ago each news link was posted. And when you do, you'll see that Japanese media did not post anything tangible about the missile launch before the details came out from South Korea.

The Kyodo News also confirms that yes, Japan DID request missile intel to South Korea.

>The South Korean JCS said it intends to share intelligence on the latest North Korean missile launches with Japan upon **Tokyo's request.**


I'll stop here, since I think this speaks for itself about who REALLY needs GSOMIA the most. But I'll leave behind one last commentary made by the KBS reporter in the aforementioned link above:

>일본 정부는 지소미아가 종료돼도 별다른 영향이 없을 거라고 큰소리쳤습니다. 하지만 막상 상황이 닥치자 채 하루도 안 돼 우리에게 슬그머니 손을 내밀고 대안을 찾느라 분주한 모양샙니다.

*After the GSOMIA has come to a conclusion, Japan boasted that it would have little effect. But it appears that as soon as the reality came crashing down, it didn't even take a whole day for Japan to hold out its hand (to ask for help) and scramble to find alternatives (for GSOMIA)*",0.0776823684573173,0.8699905276298523,0.0523270517587661,-0.0253553166985511,-0.0253553166985511,THREAT,0.8,"게시글은 북한의 미사일 발사와 관련된 정보의 중요성을 강조하고 있으며, 이는 군사적 위협을 암시하는 내용으로 해석될 수 있습니다."

 I am the host of the All Things Interesting podcast and will be interviewing Jay Solomon, a former chief foreign correspondent for the WSJ who has covered both national security and U.S. foreign policy. He is an expert on Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programs and weapons proliferation networks in the Middle East. He has also written multiple books on the geopolitics and covert wars within the region.
 
With the recent events in Saudi Arabia this past week, I wanted to reach out to the community to gather questions you all might have as it relates to the current Middle East conflicts, nuclear proliferation, North Korea and Iranian nuclear weapons development, Middle East links to the North Korean military system, and foreign policy/national security in general.
