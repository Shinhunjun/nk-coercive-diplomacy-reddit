6y8vd9,Hypothesis: North Korea's hydrogen bomb and ICBMs are not built by them,"**tl;dr**: In this very amateurish analysis, based in large part on *cui prodest* (*for whose benefit*), I posit it's likely that Russia supplied the ICBM engine and warhead. If so, these were probably used under its supervision, with no significant transfer of know-how (except maybe for the ICBM engine).

So, let's look at the current situation:

**A. Who's harmed?**

1. South Korea, Japan, China: economic and social stability take a downturn in the turmoil.
2. China: loses some power over NK and also respect from the international community. Attempting to enforce penalties on NK just pushes it farther into Russia's arms.
3. USA: loses respect by being placed in a situation with no good moves except rhetoric. A military first strike is out of the question due to the NK artillery aimed at Seoul. The emergency also draws the US's focus away from other world regions. The pressure from the US on China strains their relationship and might lead to economic losses for both of them.
4. Ukraine: the ICBM engine was identified as being of [a design manufactured in Ukraine]( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/world/asia/north-korea-missiles-ukraine-factory.html). This could lead to reprisals from its western allies for its un-reliability, even though the transfer could have taken place through Russia as an intermediary.
5. Kim Jong Un: the price on Kim's head goes up significantly, and he loses the benevolence of China. This is not a huge loss, as it had been waning for a while now, as is also evident from a series of killings of officials and Kim-family members that were known to be friendly with China.
6. Russia: loses some stability on its easternmost frontiers. If things go really haywire the most important parts of Russia are far far away from the trouble zone however.

**B. Who benefits?**

1. North Korea: moves up a level in the ""international threat"" rankings, significantly increasing its bargaining power. It also gains internal stability, by showing progress and a distinct outside threat.
2. Trump: gains a distraction from his internal problems that could postpone impeachment proceedings and an opportunity for strong rhetoric posturing.
3. Russia: all of the above except for A.6 are either harming Russia's adversaries or helping its friends. Russia also gains significant influence over Kim, while the responsibility still appears to be China's.

**C. What makes it unlikely NK just buit the ICBM and bomb themselves?**

1. The sudden jumps in technology level. The hydrogen bomb pictures in particular show an advanced two-stage miniaturised fusion design, when it was previously estimated that NK is years away from even a miniaturised *fission* device. The warhead in the pictures could be fake, but it could also be a real mock-up (if that makes sense).
2. The announcement of the hydrogen bomb test a few hours before it happened. It seems uncharacteristic and *much too confident* for something so uncertain. It would have been a great loss of face had it not worked. There are few reliability worries for a Russian warhead overseen by Russian engineers themselves.

This is obviously all conjecture, and it's mostly triggered by the last two points, I admit...

72ofjm,The potential of a limited nuclear counterforce strike on North Korea using the B61-12 bomb,"A few weeks ago I read [The New Era of Counterforce: Technological Change and the Future of Nuclear Deterrence](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/ISEC_a_00273) and found it incredibly informative and relevant especially with the situation that has unfolded in N.K. since.

The B61-12 is a GPS guided nuclear gravity bomb that has variable yields ranging from 0.3kt to 50kt. It is assumed to have similar accuracy to the JDAM. There has been considerable debate over this weapon because of it's ""usability"". The combination of  accuracy and a very low yield means that it can destroy hardened targets with negligible fallout and very little collateral damage.

These weapons are set to be deployed in 2019 and I doubt it is beyond the capabilities of the U.S. to have a portion of them ready before. Even if it is unavailable until 2019, imagine how tempting the thought must be for the Pentagon to use the bomb in a limited counterforce strike for hardened targets with conventional weapons taking care of the rest. 

A situation where Kim Jung Un dials back his rhetoric and we return to the status quo is probably what most people are hoping for. I think that neither the U.S. or China want this situation. 

The U.S. will be seen as impotent, unable to even prevent N.K. from launching ballistic missiles directly over it's allies. It will send a message to the world that a modest nuclear arsenal is capable of deterring even the U.S.

China will continue to be embarrassed by North Koreas provocations. More importantly, South Korea will remain willing to allow the U.S. to continue installing THAAD and potentially other defensive systems in the future.

China has made it clear that if the U.S. strikes N.K. first it will interfere. They also made it clear that they will stay out in the opposite situation. As far as I'm aware they haven't publicly defined what they would consider a first strike by North Korea. It seems plausible that China might actually want the U.S. to goad N.K. into doing something that wouldn't provide casus belli for an invasion, but could be used to justify a limited strike on their missile and nuclear programs. There have been plenty of such incidents over the decades, and North Korea has never had a U.S. president use rhetoric like Trump has.

If the U.S. succeeded, North Korea's missile and nuclear programs would be eliminated, the regime would remain in place preventing the refugee nightmare China is concerned with, and the U.S. will have demonstrated to nations considering starting up their own program that just posessing a small arsenal is no longer a deterrent. It seems like a win for everyone.

Kim Jung Un wouldn't be happy, but if he really is a rational actor why would he escalate and risk massive retaliation and his certain death?


I hope I haven't rambled too much, I haven't seen any discussion here about the possibility of a nuclear U.S. counterforce strike and I was just hoping to get some thoughts.


One last thought - I have no idea what the implications would be worldwide once we re-open that box. One thing I've noticed that seems odd to me is the continuing reminders from U.S. officials like Mattis about how horrific a ground war would be. What is the purpose of these reminders?

6nebxz,Would France and the UK take part in any US lead military action against North Korea?,"
I ask this because as we know the situation in North Korea is quickly coming to a head and Britain and France as signatories of the NPT and Great Powers have a choice to make. Should they play a leading role in upholding the post War order, i.e act to prevent North Korea attaining nuclear weapons (a side role undoubtedly next to the USA) or should they sit back, let the USA lead alone, or allow the post War order to change and give global nuclear proliferation a chance?    
    

Since the early 1960s, the UK and others (notably the USA) have worked to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, fearing the potential risk to the world they present, the so called ""nuclear dominion theory"". In 1968, the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was signed aimed at formalising this idea through a treaty guided by the central bargain that    

""*the NPT non-nuclear-weapon states agree never to acquire nuclear weapons and the NPT nuclear-weapon states in exchange agree to share the benefits of peaceful nuclear technology and to pursue nuclear disarmament aimed at the ultimate elimination of their nuclear arsenals.*""    
    

However, the prevention of nuclear proliferation has not always been successful, see India, Pakistan. Indeed, back in the 1960s, there were predictions that there could be as many as 25-30 nuclear-weapon states within a couple of decades. To prevent this, nuclear nations went further and offer non-nuclear nations their protection, the so called ""nuclear umbrella"", see the USA, Turkey and USA, France, Europe.
North Korea threatens to upend this balance if it successfully acquires a nuclear ICBM, it would have violated the NPT without repercussions and destroyed the central tenet of the USA ""nuclear umbrella"" guarantee to Japan, South Korea and brought to question others. Such damage to the idea of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons could be ruinous for the almost half century old policy.

Is it greater than the current situation?","As you all know, North Korea had been in the news frequently, due to their missile tests. China will not allow the US to overrun or change the NK regime because they don't want refugees, but also because they don't want a US-backed regime/US occupied regime on their border. This was also the reasoning behind their intervention in the Korean War. It made sense as the US was in the Cold War, and the Sino-Soviet split had been finalized. I can see why the Chinese don't want the US on their border, but is it worth tolerating the Kim regime, who need nuclear missiles to remain in power? NK will not give them up, and this is causing problems for Chinese influence, and makes them look weak.

62bma1,How serious of a threat is North Korea's nuclear capability to the security of the United States?,"I recently came across the following opinion article in The Hill:

http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/defense/326094-how-north-korea-could-kill-up-to-90-percent-of-americans-at-any

The article's thrust is that North Korea is:

1. Capable of miniaturizing a nuclear warhead
2. Capable of creating an ICBM to deliver that warhead
3. Able to combine those capabilities to create an EMP shock that knocks out the national powergrid

Furthermore the article cites the Congressional EMP commission's [report](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110hhrg45133/pdf/CHRG-110hhrg45133.pdf) that theorizes  the ensuing chaos could *kill 9 in 10 Americans*.

My initial reaction is that the conclusions seem wildly exaggerated, but the author of the editorial is chief of staff of said EMP commission and I certainly don't have detailed knowledge on this question.

So, two questions:

1. How accurate are the authors assessments of North Korea's nuclear capabilities?
2.

While , books can be written on the diplomatic and geopolitical incompetency which allowed North Korea to get up till  this stage , the current world is now at a point where hard actions are required.

The USA needs to start military action in North Korea before the K regime miniaturize the Nuclear device to fit onto the develery missile.

The action mainly should revolve around :

1) Air strike to level all military installations and levelling of all known artillery peices

2) Bombing and levelling of all state infrastructure like roads , government buildings , hospitals , Kim house and penthouses , electricity generaters , Dams , power supply wires etc .

3)Enforce a strict naval blockade of North Korea and shoot and sink all north Korean sea boats .

4) Bombing and eradication of all nuclear weapons sites

5) Targeted eliminations of all known North Korean scientist and engineers even remotely related to the missile and nuke program by US+ SK special forces 

6) Cyber attack and warfare wherever possible against regime infrastructure

6si5us,North Korea calls Trump's bluff - let's assess the options.,"Hours after Trump threatened ""fire, fury, and power that the world has never seen before"" as a consequence to any future North Korean threat, it has been announced that North Korea is ""carefully examining"" the possibility of a strike on Guam. This sort of red-line drawn by Trump is already being tested, and there's a small number of options.

1. Military Action- whether it be targeted strikes on nuclear facilities or ICBMs, any military action on NK risk millions of lives, given NK has loads of artillery pointed directly at Seoul (pop. ~ 10M). It seems incredibly unlikely that strikes could be coordinated to eliminate both nuclear threats and any present danger to our allies in South Korea.

2. More tough talk, no action- this would be a major walk back on President Trump's statement from earlier, and a very weak political move that hurts his credibility within his base, as well as his international image as a dominant leader. Additionally, NK would continue to make threats and build its nuclear program, but probably not ever strike first given the calamitous repercussions to the NK homeland. 

3. Chinese intervention- If executed correctly, its possible that Trump could use this increase in tensions to force China to intervene and get NK to abandon its nuclear program. It's obvious that NK economy is dependent on China, and it's also obvious that China would side with us in this situation (2016 US-China 2way trade ~580B vs <10B w NK). If China feels like a nuclear crisis is on the horizon, it's hard to imagine they'd allow it.

Feel free to reply with any other possible courses of action; these are the three that seem most likely to me.

But what was the reaction to the ""Axis of Evil"" line in Bush's 2002 State of the Union address in other countries? Whether those countries were allies of the US, outright adversaries (like the three countries listed in the ""Axis of Evil"" statement), or countries for which US relations were more complicated or ambivalent in their substance. 

Furthermore, in light of the reality of US-led regime change occurring in Afghanistan and then Iraq in from late 2001 to early 2003 - the same period in which Bush's 2002 SOTU took place - what actions did other countries undertake in response to the rhetoric and actions of the Bush administration on the matter of regime change?

72eiqz,North Korea accuses US of declaring war,"The UN convention this week has been exceptionally eventful.

First, NK's ambassador called Trump a mentally deranged megalomaniac.

Then Trump called KJU ""rocket man"" in both speech and tweet. Also threatened NK with annihilation if NK doesn't quit with the rhetoric.

Then KJU called Trump a dotard, and promises bombs and missiles as retaliation for the insults and aircraft buzzing.

Now, NK is ramping it up further by deliberately interpreting the words and actions of Trump and the USAF as a declaration of war, specifically citing Trump's words of seeing ""who wouldn't be around for much longer"" as a direct declaration of an intention to remove KJU from power.

So given the amount of playground antics and spoiled brat perspectives, how likely is a war now? Specifically:

1. How will Trump respond? Will the military continue their buzzing of airspace?

2. Will Japan continue to sound the alarm and will Abe continue to manipulate Trump and his own country in order to hold on to power? Will Abe now have his opening to finally militarize Japan?

3. What is SK's view on this recent development? Are they dismissing KJU's threats as idle or are they viewing his words as a way of trying to provoke Trump?

4. Given how SK and Japan are at complete odds on this situation, with Moon only concerned with defensive capabilities and Abe only concerned with a preemptive strike defense strategy, how are they each dealing with the US? I personally do not believe SK and Japan would be agreeable with each other at discussion meetings, given the acrimonious history between the two, I wonder if American foreign policy makers and advisors care at all that SK will absolutely never accept Japanese military on Korean soil.

5. How will China and Russia respond to this? From their perspective, does NK's declaration change the landscape for them?

Edit- posted this from my phone and didn't realize I didn't provide a link to the news:

https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-asia-41391978

Or perhaps this is just more of the same, and the world is collectively rolling their eyes?

Edit2-

Sorry I did not make this clear. I'm aware that the US has not declared war and it is just NK's ""interpretation."" I am simply wondering if such words means that Trump will try to bait KJU with more military exercises/air space buzzing. To rephrase another way: has this ""interpretation"" upped the ante yet again and does this bring us even closer to war, as both leaders have used such language as to be unable to walk back their words?",are_you_seriously,geopolitics,128,52,1506365084,/r/geopolitics/comments/72eiqz/north_korea_accuses_us_of_declaring_war/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/72eiqz/north_korea_accuses_us_of_declaring_war/,pre,nk,2025-12-09 00:35:42
7289ho,What would be the ramifications of the US acknowledging North Korea's nuclear arsenal and normalizing relations?,"Edit: Sorry, I was on the road so didn't add my own POV earlier.

It seems that nobody in the US has really proposed this option in public yet. I wonder if the US could pull off another Kissinger-esque diplomatic judo flip on North Korea, and over the next 2-3 decades, build up NK to be a stable actor in the region. 

In my opinion, NK is a rational actor, although opaque in their decision-making processes. Kim does not strike me as a foolhardy buffoon. His internal moves (e.g., killing his uncle, assassinating his half-brother) are cruel, for sure, but appear to be a strategic move to reduce Beijing's influence on his regime, not simply because he's a psychopath. My understanding is that NK is first and foremost concerned about the threat of regime change from both the US and China, and secondly concerned about building up their economy/rejoining the international community. If the US were the first to reach out, could it somehow gain an advantage and slowly convert NK into an ally over the next few decades? 

In terms of NK interests, there certainly is no love lost between Beijing and the current regime. If the US could offer Kim safety guaranteed by a limited nuclear arsenal (with guarantee of no future ICBM development) + an economic aid and development package, wouldn't he take it? 

In terms of US interests, this would seem like the US folding on NK and diminish our ability to pressure other actors, but if it is done by a new president that isn't Trump, it could potentially be a convenient way for the US to restart relations in the region and think about building NK into the current international regime a la China. 

Personally, I do not think Kim will give up his nukes for anything in the world. They are his only guarantee against a military invasion.

6yg3vu,What would happen if the US simply welcomed North Korea to the table as a nuclear power?,"All of the discussion I have seen on North Korea's nuclear capabilities seems to focus on the fact that Kim cannot be disarmed by diplomacy, sanctions, nor military action.  Even if China and Russia were 100% aligned with the US/Japan/South Korea (ie, setting aside the diplomatic implications of any action taken by the US and Allies) we still have the following issues:

1.  Kim's conventional threat against Seoul that makes any military action produce unacceptable civilian losses.  The nuclear threat greatly compounds this, (assuming sufficient intelligence does not exist to reliably knock that capability out prior to its use).

2.  Kim has demonstrated an unwillingness to use his nuclear program as a bargaining chip.  There is no indication that either sanctions or incentives will induce a voluntary disarmament.

The one option I have not seen discussed is to simply stop trying to take the weapons away, and possibly to attempt some kind of appeasement.  Admit defeat, basically, before someone gets nuked.

We already have a sort of mutually assured destruction in place. Kim can't successfully invade the south, and he can't nuke anyone without being completely destroyed.  It seems that pushing him to an act of desperation is the worst possible course of action.

Also, now that Kim has nuclear tipped ICBM's, the damage has been done.  The US has very little to lose from a technology transfer standpoint.  This should actually make it easier to provide material aid to North Korea, since the potential for harm by military appropriation of any industrial equipment is less now.  We could provide a massive aid package under the guise of ""paying tribute"" and let Kim take credit for providing the material wealth to his people.

It would not be that expensive for the superpowers to make North Korea wealthy.  Kim's regime seems uniquely resistant to revolution caused by deprivation, but it remains to be seen if it would be stable under conditions of prosperity.  Prosperity would also remove the massive wealth disparity between North and South as a blocker to reunification (leaving only Kim's desire rule...which is still a deal breaker, but a separate issue).

What do you think?  This is probably a crazy approach, but since I have never seen it seriously discussed I am curious what the consequences might be.",Wobbles42,geopolitics,31,48,1504709714,/r/geopolitics/comments/6yg3vu/what_would_happen_if_the_us_simply_welcomed_north/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/6yg3vu/what_would_happen_if_the_us_simply_welcomed_north/,pre,nk,2025-12-09 00:35:42

65o0zu,My thoughts on North Korea's nuclear ambitions and the limits of US and Chinese influence,"So, we all know what's been happening with North Korea in the last few days, and the statements which the US and China have been making on the matter. On this sub, and reddit overall, some threads have popped up asking why North Korea wants nukes or why they're so crazy or why they hate the US so much (or something like that). 

I thought I'd give my two cents on this matter as well. While reading this, please keep in mind that I don't have any sympathy for North Korea and obviously have no desire for them to acquire nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles and also view much of their actions as destabilizing, but to get to the core of the matter we need to treat North Korea's actions and beliefs in a detached manner.

--------------------------------

Much of the discussion have revolved around what can be done to prevent NK from getting nukes, short of military force. US exercises of deterrence and Chinese influence and sanctions are often cited along the lines of what may help to prevent NK from testing a nuke or a missile and keep fatty Kim from being too crazy, and eventually to get NK to abandon their nuclear ambitions overall one day, peacefully.

Unfortunately, I believe such a prospect is unlikely, if we take a step back and consider why North Korea actually wants nukes. 

Is it because North Korea wants to have the ability to strike the US or Japan because Kim and his associates have brain washed themselves into hating them? Is it because North Korea wants nukes to hold the world to nuclear ransom? Is it because North Korea wants to have some way of taking over South Korea? 

I think all of those are possible, but in the eyes of Kim, I believe those are all vastly smaller secondary reasons compared to the primary reason, which I think most media and geopolitical discourse does not sufficiently cover.

And I believe that reason is self preservation. Fear. 

During the Cold War, prior to the USSR's dissolution, NK was effectively under the protection of the USSR, not only economically but to a degree militarily. NK knew it's survival was partly guaranteed by the strength of the USSR-US geopolitical struggle.

But between the early 1990s to the 2000s, two significant geopolitical events occurred, related to NK's self perceived security.

* First was the significant dissolution of NK's sense of diplomatic and geopolitical support and security, due to the dissolution of the USSR (though the USSR had begun to wind down their relationship with NK by the late Cold War anyway), but also due to China's significant economic re-orientation and integration with the rest of the world, leaving NK very diplomatically and geopolitically isolated. In the span of under a decade, NK realized it was basically alone, facing an economically and technologically powerful South Korea with the backing and support of the US, not to mention other allies like Japan, and even more distant countries like Australia, UK and New Zealand. 

* Secondly, was the US and the west's wielding of significant military power to conduct interventions, invasions, and regime change in a number of nations in the post Cold War era. The 2003 invasion of Iraq being probably one of the most primary examples, but the first Gulf War and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and the subsequent events in that country probably shook NK's government and then Kim Jong Il quite substantially. More recent events like the coalition against Libya, and the US stance towards countries like Iran have probably caused such a fear to take a more permanent hold of the younger, current Kim. 

I believe that those two changes put together, along with the many decade long mutual animosity between NK with the US+SK, created a sense of significant fear in the Kim government that they would effectively be ""next"". Being listed on GWB's modern ""axis of evil"" in 2002 definitely did not help their sense of security. 

I believe the Kim government believed their only way of attaining security for themselves that they could guarantee for themselves, against a foe far more powerful than themselves -- i.e.: the US -- was by having nukes.

What resulted from 2006 when NK conducted its first nuclear test, was a self feeding circle where the US and its allies in SK and Japan have conducted very significant military exercises on or near the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea provocations whether they are nuclear tests or missile tests, or things like sinking a SK corvette or shelling a SK village. NK in turn views those exercises as dress rehearsals for decapitation strikes against Kim and his cronies as well as regime change against NK akin to what the US has done quite successfully in quite a number of times over the last few decades around the world, thus further accelerating their nuclear ambitions.

The key take away, I think, is that NK and Kim likely sees their nukes and the ability to launch them to the continental US as a vital requirement for their very survival. No one wants them to get nukes, whether it's the US, China, SK, Japan, Russia, or whomever. But NK really, really, really wants them and from their point of view they need them to survive.

From there, I think it becomes obvious to see why the current policy vectors of the US and China will not stop NK's goal for nukes. 

* For the US, the primary policy to NK's nukes is basically via high profile military displays with allies. Sanctions, whether it's from US and its allies or via UN have little to no effect anymore, so the last card to repeatedly play is via military actions to deter NK from acting up too much and to try to dissuade NK from further nuclear testing. Of course, there have been reports that the US have been using cyber warfare to sabotage NK's missile tests, and I consider that to be very likely and credible. But none of these actions produce a policy that are able to dissuade NK from developing nukes, and if anything they are likely to further strengthen Kim's siege mentality and strengthen their determination to develop nukes. Cyber warfare will put NK's missiles back years and years, but they will likely get there eventually, because their resolve will remain due to their fundamental fear for their own survival.

* For China, it's a bit more complicated because obviously everyone knows not only China's actions are limited due to the risk of a NK collapse causing a flood of refugees into its borders, but also because China fears the geopolitical consequence of a NK collapse where they may lose a vital buffer against the US allied South Korea and may end up facing US ground forces across the Yalu, which of course was the whole reason why China got into the original Korean War to begin with. But, on top of all of that, I believe even if China further cracked down on trade with North Korea and applying political pressure North Korea as the US and Trump has wished, that would not produce the desired result of getting NK to stop its nuclear and missile programmes, partly because China already lacks any substantial political influence over NK since about the late 2000s, but also because it would further show them that China cannot be counted on as even a vague security guarantee and they would seek nukes even more to guarantee their own survival against the US. A very real possibility that China needs to face as well, is if China economically punishes NK too much then NK may end up even pointing a few of its nukes towards China as well if they feel China has turned on them. 

-----------------------------------

So, I think a peaceful resolution to North Korea's nuclear ambitions is very unlikely. That's because the primary fundamental rationale behind NK's nuclear ambition is to preserve its own survival due to their perception of existential threat from the US -- their requirement for nukes is to achieve one of deterrence (though I admit using that word for North Korea who seem so cartoonishly evil and unstable is a little bit strange to type). 

The only way for NK to relinquish its nukes willingly and peacefully, in my opinion, is if there were some sort of grand bargain where NK is 110% sure that the US would not threaten them and more importantly if NK did not perceive the US would **ever** be a threat to them.

But obviously such an arrangement is geopolitically ridiculous, as the North's requirements for such an arrangement will obviously not be acceptable to the US for a whole multitude of reasons and likely involve substantial reduction if not total withdrawal of US forces in Northeast Asia if not the whole of East Asia, and even then it probably would not be enough for NK because they would see the US's ability to easily redeploy back into theatre via naval and airlift as a big threat. The US, for its part, would rightly see any such action as giving up on allies like SK and Japan, as well as opening SK up to attack by the North, and may likely feel NK won't hold its end of the bargain, not to mention the associated loss of geopolitical influence in a key region which its military assets there help to provide, US geopolitical credibility worldwide etc, and the list just goes on and on.

(And to be frank, the very notion of NK and the US sitting down at the table with each other as anything like equals is likely anathema to anyone and everyone in the US government.)

Anyway, these are my thoughts on the matter. A few of the details here or there might be challenged or debatable, but I believe the fundamental premise of NK's requirement for nukes (survival/sense of existential threat from the US), and the conclusion derived from that premise (current US and China policy vectors being ineffective in both the short term and long term) as being sound and stable.",PLArealtalk,geopolitics,160,63,1492327884,/r/geopolitics/comments/65o0zu/my_thoughts_on_north_koreas_nuclear_ambitions_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/65o0zu/my_thoughts_on_north_koreas_nuclear_ambitions_and/,pre,nk,2025-12-09 00:35:42

65f3d5,"Once North Korea falls, how likely is it that a United Korea will remain in America's orbit?","Assuming China is run by intelligent people, Its difficult for me to find a way that keeps a united Korea in the American orbit. China is not much of a threat if they remain on their side of the Yalu, and US security guarantees will be increasingly irrelevant as a United Korea's next greatest security threat is Japan.

A scenario where tensions boil over and China  backstabs Kim and uses the land it has taken to extract concessions re: US troop basing and Economic contracts would only hasten this, but without North Korea, security guarantees for Korea would seem to be secondary to the very real concerns of any amount of funding in order to rebuild the North.

I can only see South Korea playing both China and the US off each other in the short run as both countries battle for influence in order to make the unification as smooth as possible, but increasingly turning to China due to them simply having more money to offer and more influence due to being right next door. 

Not to mention Japan. 

Without North Korea to unite them, How would relations not cool as Dokdo comes back into the spotlight?

Basically how does the US win the peace without relying on Chinese leadership being stupid? I'm not seeing it...

70ixlr,Misconceptions about North Korean policy,"It is a misconception to link North Korea’s nuclear program with America’s war time conduct during the Korean War. Across all “alternative” media websites, one finds the same point repeated: America killed ~20% of NK’s population and therefore, the latter is building nukes to protect themselves, especially in light of aggressive military exercises by SK and the U.S.

There are multiple problems with this thinking. First, the primary goal of the NK leadership is self-preservation. This triumphs over everything else, including the survival and health of their own people. NK wants to build nukes not to protect its people, but to protect the ruling clique. If the elite truly cared about their people, to the extent they would allow harsh sanctions to be imposed on them and spend much funds on nuclear weapons, then why hasn’t the leadership allowed reunification with SK yet? The NK people would immediately become wealthier and live better lives. Further, why run such a harsh dictatorship? We can conclude from this that the NK regime cares more about itself than its people. Moving on to my second point: the situation NK faces now is completely different than the one it faced in the 50s, 60s, and 70s. Up till the 70s, the conventional view was that NK and SK were pretty much equal; both were dictatorships and had fairly similarly-sized economies. Kim il-Sung probably thought the same, when he boasted of the [following](http://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/114533
), in a conversation with First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party:

> 
> 
> If they listen to us and a confederation is established, South Korea will be done with. South Korea will have to reduce its army, we will reduce ours too. But this will bring about the elimination of the reactionary regime in South Korea, because without an army the people, themselves, will rise. That is why, in reality, the South Koreans do not accept our proposals at all.
> 
> The goals of this slogan can be achieved because the patriots of South Korea, the democratic forces there, the people who want this unification, will understand that the traitors are, indeed, the ruling establishment in South Korea, and the patriots are the communists in North Korea.
> 
> I believe we will not fail, we will not lose. Our cooperative farmers will not allow the landowners to come back to power. Many peasants from South Korea, when they see how our cooperative farmers live, will want to establish such cooperative farms there too.
> 
> The political goals we are after with the confederation are: not allowing Japanese imperialism in South Korea, elimination of the US military bases in South Korea, and increasing our influence among the people of South Korea. Of course, if we are weak, propagating up such a slogan would be dangerous for us.
> 
> If a more democratic power is established in South Korea, then we would not bring up the slogan for this confederation. We will simply call it the revolution.


It provides a fascinating look into NK’s thinking. And when reading it, one can’t help but notice the tremendous irony in Kim il-Sung’s statements: now, it is the South that is a true democracy. Now, it is the South that is an economic behemoth, providing a 1st-world living standard for its people. Now, it is the people of North Korea who have to be suppressed from forming a revolution to overthrow their own oppressors, after seeing how their South Korean brethren live. This changed environment is what explains NK’s rationale behind building nukes. During the above times, NK genuinely thought it would be invaded again, hence, it too great measures to protect its people, like building the world’s deepest train system, doubling as a comb shelter. There was a genuine threat that the U.S./S.K. would flatten the country again.

But this is no longer the case. Back during the Korean War, the Americans didn’t have nearly as much of military superiority as they have now. This is why they resorted to bombing the populace itself, to do as much damage as possible. Now? No need to do any of that. Precision bombing of NK’s nuclear and missile sites, and targeting other weaponry should be enough. In fact, when people claim that American military exercises provoked NK into building nukes, because it reminds them of the carnage inflicted during the Korean War, they actually argue against themselves. This is because current SK-U.S. military exercises largely focus on one mission: decapitating the NK leadership. These exercises do not involve large bombing runs over the entire country.

At the end of the day, I still think the NK leadership doesn’t care about its people enough to divert all these resources to building nukes, especially because it hasn’t allowed reunification.

My last point: why doesn’t the NK leadership want unification? If one examines their propaganda, it’s clear that to this day, the North wants some sort of confederation with the South. Their propaganda leaflets even contain this. Read this post by a Professor who has spent decades reading and understanding NK propaganda, in its native language:

http://sthelepress.com/index.php/2017/08/11/low-level-confederation-and-the-nuclear-crisis-in-2-parts-b-r-myers/

The NK leadership does not want reunification. In fact, one of the “four no’s” given by Russia and China at the U.N. involves “no accelerated reunification” by the U.S.:

https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/sc12983.doc.htm

NK doesn’t want reunification for one reason and one reason alone: it would force the ruling clique to give up power, subjecting itself to the democratic whims of a new country where they would have to share power with others, in a diminished or non-existent manner.",DownWithAssad,geopolitics,6,8,1505590937,/r/geopolitics/comments/70ixlr/misconceptions_about_north_korean_policy/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/70ixlr/misconceptions_about_north_korean_policy/,pre,nk,2025-12-09 00:35:42

Thanks in advance for any answers!
