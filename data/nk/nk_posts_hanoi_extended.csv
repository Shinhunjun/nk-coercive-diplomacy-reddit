dz4cmw,Is it actually in United States overall interests in Asian region to solve North Korean problem?,"I was just thinking today that one of the main things that justifies US military presence so near Chinese borders is North Korea. In a scenario in which North Korea is no longer a threat, US really has no justification to keep large amounts of military in the region, other than to protect its allies like Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Also I think that as long as North Korean threat exists, it is also in Chinese interests to have forces in the region that can keep North Korea in check. Once North Korea no longer becomes an actual threat to US, I think it will largely legitimize Chinese calls for US withdrawal from the region and US leadership will have hard time to justify the current, large-scale deployment, wargames, and the financial burden to its electorate.

c865ad,Why the US does not want North Korea and Iran to have nukes,"North Korea and Iran are on the news for their nuclear ambitions. Iran is on the way to having the capability and North Korea is on its way to have a working ICBM. It is cited they are they using it for deterence, to prevent their nation from collapse by an outside power. Critics of US policy has cited nuclear weapons are for defense against the US, and the US has nothing to worry about.

However, the US has constantly provoked North Korea and the tensions got so high it almost amounted to war. Why is this? Why does the US fear third rate powers with nukes? The answer is it defeats the Flexible Response doctrine of the US. Typically US military is there to counter top powers like the Soviet Union. The US uses a system called ""Flexible Response"" to counter both nuclear and conventional threats. It also suscribes to ""proportional respond"" to defend its allies. If the enemy uses conventional forces, the reponse is conventional response back, if nukes the US will use nukes.

Take US v China on Taiwan. If US does get in a war where China is using conventional weapons, US could win(likely) with its 10 carriers, thousands of fighters, nuclear submarines and better tech. If China were tip to scale using tactical nuclear weapons, US could respond by hitting non-city Chinese targets, with its more warheads. US has more missile defenses, more carriers that can hide and move, and intel assets, so even in a non-city nuclear war US could come out of top with both sides bloodied. A total strategic nuclear war, it would be Mutually Assured Destructuction, but I doubt China will give its cities for Taiwan.

Now this is the doctrine against a power like China or Russia. But enter North Korea with an ICBM and everything changes. North Korea is just as capable of defeating US static targets like military bases in Asia with its medium range nuclear missile force. Without ICBMs with answer was easy, take out North Korea completly(including city targets with nukes or overwhelming conventional superiority). However with an ICBM, North Korea could destroy US cities. With an ICBM, North Korea using its medium range missile destroying major US bases will cripple US capability on the Pacific and the US would be limited to restrained retaliation. US can't destroy Pyongyang and topple the regime without getting LA and New York getting nuked. It could nuke the North Korean military bases, but that won't topple the regime, just contain North Korea and beat back its military from taking the South. US military would still be bloodied after a Phyric victory, used a lot of its nukes on a rather insignifcant nation...and now China is possibly much stronger and could be possibly on parity with US capability.

&#x200B;

This is why US doesn't want such a insignificant power to get nukes. It is very imbalance of power. So why would North Korea risk such a move? Well in the US mind, beligerents are not rational, and would take huge risks even with a high chance of losing.(Japan, Germany, Saddam etc). North Korea may use its nukes to say ""give up South Korea or your Pacific military will be crippled by nukes"". Just like how Saddam planned to US surrender by fighting a bloody battle where the US civilian populace would give up(it didn't happen thanks to US conventional superiority)

So what could the US do? Well the answer now is Missile Defense. The problem is that it is not a 100 percent defense, but it may be able to save major military bases against the Medium range threat,(ie. THAAD)while new interepotrs in Alaska can stop the ICBM threat. North Korea doesn't have a working ICBM yet, hopefully US tests would be make Missile Defense good enough in time. US would be putting Missile Defense in Europe to defend against Russia. However, Iran has no ICBM yet, so that is less of a threat.",Andyhuang2299,geopolitics,2,6,1562051526,/r/geopolitics/comments/c865ad/why_the_us_does_not_want_north_korea_and_iran_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/c865ad/why_the_us_does_not_want_north_korea_and_iran_to/,post_hanoi,nk,2025-12-12 17:22:17

I’m a London-based foreign correspondent for USA TODAY. I have worked for USA TODAY for almost seven years. I report on a broad range of foreign affairs-related topics, with an emphasis on making comparisons to U.S. policy and experience. In Europe, I have covered refugee crises, immigration, terrorism, the lingering impact of disasters, Russia-related topics, the conflict in Ukraine and, above all, the extraordinary stories and experiences of ordinary people. I have also reported from the Middle East, including in [Iran](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/world/inside-iran/2018/08/29/iran-trump-reimposes-sanctions-tensions-countries-enemies-nuclear-deal/886692002/), Israel, the Palestinian territories, and in North Africa.

eer652,"John Bolton, North Korea, and the Trump White House's Successes and Failures","[In an exclusive interview](https://www.axios.com/bolton-john-trump-north-korea-missiles-94088bf9-4d2d-4d10-bfd9-80db7bc36a50.html), former U.S. National Security  Advisor John Bolton told Axios that the Trump Administration should admit its approach to end North Korea’s nuclear arms program has “failed.” Bolton suggested the Trump administration is ""bluffing"" about stopping North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and it would be “very unusual” for this White House to say that they were wrong.

John Bolton, though, is an interesting figure himself to say the least. Bloomberg, [in their piece on how Bolton's departure could impact the President's foreign policy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-11/john-bolton-trump-foreign-policy), described Bolton as ""the most vocal hardliner [in] President Donald Trump's inner circle."" Bolton's departure has also been met by favorable and affirmative statements from other government, [including that of North Korea](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-20/north-korea-praises-trump-for-ousting-troublemaker-bolton). Foreign Policy magazine went so far as to [analogize](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/01/john-bolton-is-ready-to-go-rogue/) the Trump-Bolton relationship with the tumultuous Reagan-Haig relationship of the 1980s. If that were the case, I'd imagine Mr. Bolton would love to criticize Mr. Trump regardless of how effectively the White House operates.

That being said, Kim Jong Un has been presenting himself to be very tough recently. Earlier this month [he inspected](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/kim-jong-un-is-back-on-his-white-horse-as-north-korea-flags-a-big-decision/2019/12/03/7bbc9b2a-163c-11ea-80d6-d0ca7007273f_story.html) ""revolutionary battle sites"" around Mount Paektu, and [warned Washington](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/north-korea-warns-united-states-of-an-unwelcome-christmas-gift/2019/12/03/ad406634-1599-11ea-80d6-d0ca7007273f_story.html) that it could soon receive an ""unwelcome Christmas gift,"" calling us all back to remember [the last thing](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/05/asia/north-korea-missile-nuclear-gift/index.html) North Korea described as a ""gift."" I'm no deterrence theorist, but that seems a bit like bolstering reputation and interest.

So, what are we supposed to believe. Is John Bolton right in saying the Trump White House is failing in North Korea, or is John Bolton merely criticizing an ex-employer? More specifically, could you give me any insights on: 

 - **What successes (and failures) has the Trump Administration seen in its relations with North Korea;**
 - **Are those successes (and failures) significant compared to the successes of other Presidencies;**
 - **Can those successes be maintained (or those failures undone) by this Administration, or are they fleeting, and;** 
 - **Is it reasonable to believe that another specific strategy is definitively more likely to bring about more success (or less failure)?**
