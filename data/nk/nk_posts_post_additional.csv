al7gv8,"Can an ICBM armed North Korea ""win"" a war against US and South Korea?"," How dangerous is an ICBM armed North Korea? The worse case scenario is if they use their short ranged and medium range missiles to rain hell on South Korea, and we have no way to respond strategically. They can effectively invade South Korea. Of course US troops can use employ tactical nuclear weapons to beat by NK's armies and score a military victory, however the destruction of NK's cities and deposal of the Kim regime will likely result in North Korea launching their ICBM to hit major US cities in retaliation.   


North Korea's missiles are mobile based so they are very hard to take out all of them in a first strike, unlike silo based missiles. The US could use missile defense systems like THAAD, AEGIS, along with the Ground Based Interceptor in Alaska and California to score a victory however they are not 100 percent reliable to prevent no cities from getting hit.   


Yes, the US military can probably win a military victory against North Korea, however I think tables will turn if China starts supporting the North Koreans. They can send their troops intermixed with NK's troops, making US fears of using tactical nuclear weapons on Chinese too much of a risk. US assets will have to be diverted to fighting China rather focus on the NK peninsula. US and China might agree to a ceasefire and NK will effectively rule the radioactive peninsula.",Warriormind556,geopolitics,1,8,1548812245,/r/geopolitics/comments/al7gv8/can_an_icbm_armed_north_korea_win_a_war_against/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/al7gv8/can_an_icbm_armed_north_korea_win_a_war_against/,post,nk,2025-12-09 00:35:42

8qh3qi,Does North Korea have better options than rapprochement with the U.S. (and meeting the U.S.'s terms of giving up its nukes)?,"An old adage of statesmanship is that you never give up your weapons if you do not have to.  What if North Korea had followed (or follows) this path:

1)  Halt all bellicose talk.

2) Offer formal apology to South Korea (and possibly reparations) for the various naval hostilities the North has engaged in the past 25 years, including the 2010 ROKS Cheonan sinking. 

3)  Resume as much as possible, without U.S. involvement, amicable relations with South Korea, including relative visits, opening attractions on the border for South Koreans tourists to visit, openly reducing military personnel on the border.  North Korean objective: to *talk past* U.S. officials and interface directly with South Korea.

4) Engage in large-scale expansion of economic ties with Chinese.  Ease restrictions on northern border for business and travel in both directions, though not so much that large scale migration of Koreans north would ensue (which China would not want in any event.)

China is lukewarm about North-South reunification because of the prospect of U.S. military troops stationed in North Korea.  Seems that a broad rapprochement between North and South Korea while North Korea simultaneously evidences distrust/dislike of the U.S. would be welcomed by the Chinese.

North Korea could gradually and calmly put forth the narrative that the departure of the U.S. from the Korean peninsula in the next 20-25 year is best for all parties. 

Granted U.S. sanctions would remain in effect.  But would North Korean actions (above) compel the Chinese to further ignore the sanctions and undertake large scale investment in North Korea--with the inevitable result (10-20 years) that North Korea become the respected actor on the world stage that it wants to be?  And North Korea still has its nukes?",Markdd8,geopolitics,4,15,1528789245,/r/geopolitics/comments/8qh3qi/does_north_korea_have_better_options_than/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/8qh3qi/does_north_korea_have_better_options_than/,post,nk,2025-12-09 00:35:42

945nqu,My take on Trumps meeting with Kim Jong Un,"1. We are caught in a strange historical moment. Trump, the American President just shook hands happily with a North Korean Dictator. 

2. US policy makers and president alike wouldn’t be caught dead shaking hands with a North Korean Dictator.  (Although Clinton did meet with the Kim Jung Il Citation: [https://abcnews.go.com/International/prominent-americans-met-north-korean-leaders/story?id=53635089](https://abcnews.go.com/International/prominent-americans-met-north-korean-leaders/story?id=53635089)).  However President is Trump is an anomaly.  He truly seems to act on his own, good or bad.  So why was Trump able to set up this seemingly peaceful meeting, especially after all the “little rocket man” rhetoric?

3. North Korea is pretty isolated.  Its main allies are China, who acts like a big brother, and Russia.  Russia doesn’t affiliate themselves with too much with North Korea, but some speculate Russia helped North Korea obtain nuclear capabilities more quickly.  They share a small border as well.

4. In the Trump era, America has entered a strange space.  He doesn’t follow normal American policy, which is obvious.  

5. During the 2016 American presidential primaries the Republican Party changed an important party policy on the Crimea takeover by Russia.  Trump apparently directed the change to more or less support the Russians on the Crimea annexation.  Trump even recently repeated a talking point by Putin himself saying “everyone there speaks Russian”, therefore Crimea is essentially Russian territory.

6. Trump has flip flopped and given criticism to everyone in the past two years, even his own children.  The one person he doesn’t flip flop on?  President Vladimir Putin.  So what the hell is going on?

7.Earlier we mentioned North Koreas allies, which is important..  Who benefits from these Geopolitical decisions?  Because it definitely isn’t the US overall.

8. The United States has soft power all over the globe.  Its one of the great benefits of the Post WWII order, which the US directed.  America has “800 military bases in more than 70 countries and territories” \[[https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/us-military-bases-around-the-world-119321](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/us-military-bases-around-the-world-119321)\]

9. Directly after Trump met face to Face with Kim he decided to cut off War Games with South Korea in the Korean peninsula, citing costs.  Trump seems to believe that saving money is more important than having a military presence in one of the nations most contested sea beds.  Just south of the Korean peninsula, in the South China Sea the Chinese have an unprecedented presence.  They have been creating entire islands in order to have more control over the vital commerce and shipping done by ship.   After World War II the United states had near overt control of the oceans and shipping lanes; something never accomplished by any other nation in history.  So why would the United States jeopardize this accomplishment?

10.  The winners here are many but not the United States.  China, South Korea, Japan, Russia and North Korea all gain wins from Trumps meeting with Kim.  Here is how:

11. China, Russia and North Korea gain a win by seeing the presence of the American military vanish.  In turn the Us military gets hit by losing a close vantage point where they can watch North Korea and China, while helping allies S. Korea and Japan.  America has more warships than any nation combined; even one of these vessels deters aggression in the region.  This sea is also close to Russia, who would like to see American warships vanish.  Trump thinks it’s a waste of money and wants to pull them out.  We’ll see.  

12.  However the world becomes a winner if the negative warmongering rhetoric and threats go away.  If Trump succeeds in getting North Korea to denuclearize it is a grand win for the World. 

13.  Lets tally up the geopolitical score here.  Putin wins in a few ways.  They see an ally of theirs \[N. Korea\] get brought up to the world stage by meeting face to face with the leader of the free world.  They get respect and confirmation from the American president and one of their biggest parties, the GOP, that the Crimea takeover was legitimate; and they get American soft power removed from the Korean peninsula.  China also wins in these ways.  North Korea now looks levelheaded and willing to bring themselves into the fold of the global  order.  South Korea wins because this opens the field to possible reunification.  The capital of South Korea is 60 miles from the border with the north.  South Koreans have lived under the threat of bombardment of artillery and even worse: possible nuclear weapons.  Japan also wins in this way.  America wins if the North Korean threats are squashed for good, but only time will tell.  It’s a gamble but for a president who hasn’t been able to court any domestic wins overtly, it does seem to be a win for him and his administration in a strange way, albeit a confusing one. 

Please correct me if Im wrong on any of my statements.  Im just trying to encourage discussion.",Animated_post,geopolitics,7,6,1533262852,/r/geopolitics/comments/945nqu/my_take_on_trumps_meeting_with_kim_jong_un/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/945nqu/my_take_on_trumps_meeting_with_kim_jong_un/,post,nk,2025-12-09 00:35:42

8xajg7,What was Trump's rationale for withdrawing from JCPOA just before meeting Kim-Jong Un?,"I've heard people say the move only undermined trust in America's word at precisely the worst possible moment. But given the timing, was it not more likely a deliberate signal to NK that they had better be prepared to make the concessions necessary to convince Congress?

The worst possible outcome for the US would be a half-measure or incrementally implemented deal that relieves pressure on NK only for NK to renege and rebound in an even more powerful position in future. On the other hand, it would be difficult to demand to NK's faces, after their charm offensive and gestures of good faith, that they should give up everything before receiving anything.

Could it be that withdrawing from the JCPOA was intended to resolve this dilemma? When negotiating with NK, the Trump administration can now point to the failure of JCPOA as justification for pursuing nothing less than a treaty with Congress, and then to the inflexibility of Congress as justification for making heavy demands before giving any concessions.

The Trump administration can now credibly exhibit good faith and trust in NK's intentions by pointing to Congress as an unshakable reality/constraint both parties have to work under -- a kind of good-cop bad-cop situation.

Ultimately the JCPOA may have eliminated a middle-ground that was considered dangerous from the American perspective, but would have been difficult to avoid by persuasion/positive negotiation.

Any thoughts?

8fxvxa,"What options are there, if Trump-Kim meeting fails?","Everyone is so upbeat about the ""historic"" meeting between Kim and Moon. Historic, perhaps, but also 3rd in 25 years, second in 10. Last time around they blew publicly the cooling pipeline for enrichment in one of their nuclear facilities. In short, been there, done that. 

Back to the policy options, however. US wants Kim to ""denuclearize"" whatever that means. China and N.K. want US to clear the peninsula from US presence (no threat of TNW, no military presence, or joint military exercises with SK). Some of it is possible (see 1990-1 Bush Sr. actions), but others may not be so feasible (US abandoning SK and its security agreement). There is a good deal of risk that the meeting will produce nothing at all, or very little in substance that even if it is blown out of proportions for domestic use in both US and NK, may amount to nothing at all. 

My question is, what is the array of options that could follow in the case of failure of reaching an agreement with Kim? China and SK are already on board, and somehow the process could (theoretically) continue without the US. Or can it? 

In short, if the meeting fails to produce an agreement, Trump will have no other option but to pursue a hard line against NK (harder than now, which may see more sanctions, and more provocations with joint military exercises). That seems dangerous and counter-productive, no?

8qmcl0,Trump’s Singapore Summit Was a Bust—for the U.S.,"Understanding that I view the Trump presidency as an existential threat to world order and a diminishing of American presence on the world stage, nonetheless I believe it is far too early to label the Korean Peace process a failure or a bust for the United States. So we met with Kim Jong Un and he gains some prestige due to this meeting. How does that hurt the U.S? Does it eliminate sanctions or provide economic relief for Korea? Does it mean that other world leaders will come flocking to the Hermit Kingdom bearing gifts of whiskey or frankincense and myrh? We have put a halt on war games. That makes sense. Does anyone think South Korea cannot defend itsel from the North? The North has put all of its dwindling resources into nuclear weapons, their defecting soldiers have worms in them for crying out loud. The North Korean military is going to make the Iraqi Republican Guard look like world beaters. South Korea has a modern powerful military and while the civilian casualties would be enormous there is no doubt they could defend against a conventional attack by North Korea. There is no troubling give away here, it is merely a symbolic pause in our exercises with South Korea.

South Korea uses nuclear energy to power their economy. The USA undoubtedly has nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula or off its coast. 

What does this all mean for South Korea and the USA going forward?

8nu7nc,Why the hell would NK ever denuclearize? (South Korean),"As I South Korean, I've seen peace talks and 'reunification' hypes ever since the Kim and Roh presidency as well as the recently opened ones. Koreans (regardless north and south) are taught that reunification is their priority since they were young but thoughts are changing nowadays due to realistic approach on economic impact and the burden that South Koreans have to take.


North Korea being the hermit kingdom, where Kim's word is basically the party's voice a.k.a the 'law', how would an economic incentive really fuel the decision markers of the North to throw away their Nukes.

I'm pretty sure Kim has seen what happened to Kaddafi  when he threw away his nukes. They did get sanctions lifted and aid given and their economy did improve greatly in the short years after. And after that... well... you all know.

Also, as much as it is a dictatorship, the country can't just abandon their 'one great goal' of developing nukes with all the stuff they told their people of how it will stop the 'imperial Americans' from invading them. (Although I guess it is effective) It would make Kim look foolish when he demanded sacrifice for everything else just for developing Nukes

My guess is that, if this talk is really one for ""reunification"" and not one for just another bs peace talk, 
demilitarization can be only agreed when South Korea decides to abandon or lower US influence and it's troops (North has asked for troops to be removed numerous times prior to the summit). Which leads for China to be more open about the whole ""unification idea"" since US is out of it's immediate presence. But this wouldn't again make sense since the US has to back out it's line now to Japan, Japan arming themselves up and they would have a shitshow with Taiwan.

In sum, I don't get why the hell NK would denuclearize rather than keeping it's status-quo",specialkey92,geopolitics,54,90,1527877403,/r/geopolitics/comments/8nu7nc/why_the_hell_would_nk_ever_denuclearize_south/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/8nu7nc/why_the_hell_would_nk_ever_denuclearize_south/,post,nk,2025-12-09 00:35:42

8a7kxe,Is Trump threatening a trade war with China to gain leverage in negotiations with North Korea?,"So, Trump just announced that [he's considering additional tariffs on China](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/business/trump-trade-war-china.html) after their recent threats of retaliatory tariffs. This will ratchet up tensions even more and has increased the likelihood of a trade war. Trump's actions have been widely criticized and I can't think of any possible upside to this. Not only will the sanctions harm the US economy, it seems like it will be a *catastrophe* for Trump politically. Here's the situation as I see it:

Trump is still deeply unpopular and the GOP's only real defense of his administration has been the recent stock market surge and fairly strong economy. The stock markets have already dropped after he announced the tariffs and a continued trade war will almost certainly be bad for the economy overall, and *especially* the rural, blue-collar workers in Trump's base. The Chinese retaliations are targeted at the US agriculture and auto industries which have huge political importance. Republicans are in a very precarious position with the upcoming midterm elections and Trump could lose support from his allies in congress. Other countries have also threatened retaliation, which further isolates him from the international community.

On the China's side, their economy depends heavily on exporting goods to the US, but the Chinese government can pressure companies in ways the US can't. They also control their news outlets/media narrative and heavily censor dissent and criticism. Plus, Xi Jinping just removed term limits for himself, ensuring his future political power. Trump's plan is universally condemned by economists, industry leaders, and major allied governments. There's *no way* Trump could survive the political fallout longer than Xi Jinping? These tariffs seem not just ill-advised, but foolish beyond belief.

I've been trying to think of any possible justification, and this is all that came to mind: With Trump's recent agreement to meet with Kim Jong Un, is it possible that Trump will offer to alleviate the sanctions on China in exchange for distancing themselves from the Kim regime? Assuming the meeting actually happens, it seems like this move could help gain leverage by weakening the North Korea's bond with its only ally. He's already shown willingness to carve out exemptions for other countries (e.g. South Korea, Canada, and Mexico).

There are several reasons why I'm skeptical about this. For starters, I don't think Trump is nearly clever enough to concoct a scheme like this. It's far more likely that he's just implementing the populist policies that helped get him elected, brazenly ignoring his advisors, and reacting dramatically and trying to show strength. The idea that he's a master dealmaker and that we just can't understand his next-level strategizing has been repeatedly debunked.

That being said, it still seems like that plan could *possibly* be a legitimate strategy. Trump has always been fond of high-stakes risks, bold ambit claims, and throwing allies under the bus to gain leverage. If he's *remotely* capable of political savvy and strategic thinking, this seems like the kind of thing he would go for.

I'm no expert on these matters, but I haven't seen this idea discussed elsewhere. Is there anything I'm missing? I'd be interested in hearing what all of you think.",wugglesthemule,geopolitics,54,65,1522999265,/r/geopolitics/comments/8a7kxe/is_trump_threatening_a_trade_war_with_china_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/8a7kxe/is_trump_threatening_a_trade_war_with_china_to/,post,nk,2025-12-09 00:35:42

btudnd,Is Trump's dismissal of worry over North Korea's continued missile activities basically correct?,"Trump seems to be suggesting that the Koreans are simply posturing.  Isn't that right, and don't we see this all the time?

The U.S. has been posturing in the Middle East big time for weeks now to threaten Iran.   The Russians recently flew planes near our northern borders--again, for about the umpteenth time.  The Chinese will likely provoke some new issue in the South China sea soon, prompting more U.S. ship movements in the area, amid rhetoric. 

Posturing is what nations do, especially semi-belligerent nations at odds with other semi-belligerent nations.  North Korea has nukes.  It has missiles.  What else is new?

Kim Jong-un is posturing to try to influence the sanctions on him.  Should we accept that for what it appears to be, or agree with John Bolton's more hardline views on North Korea.",Markdd8,geopolitics,81,30,1559009372,/r/geopolitics/comments/btudnd/is_trumps_dismissal_of_worry_over_north_koreas/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/btudnd/is_trumps_dismissal_of_worry_over_north_koreas/,post,nk,2025-12-09 00:35:42

873dy1,"If the US goes to war with Iran, will Russia or China come to Iran's aid?

So if the US attacks either of those countries, will we see a scenario in which Russia or China comes to their defense and backs them up militarily? In other words, could we see Russia or China go up against the US in a direct military conflict if the US attacks Iran or North Korea?

aym0tk,"The North Korean Question, a South Korean perspective.","SS: The world in which we live in is anarchic in nature and states strive to survive in with all means available. That is the essence of international relations and unrealistic idealism would be detrimental for the general well-being of a nation if not the world itself. 

That being said, North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons, while very dangerous, is understandable in their perspective. The disparity of power between North Korea and South Korea is beyond comparison and NK is threatened not only from the US-KOR alliance but potentially also from China. A toothless North Korea will be practically a vassal/satellite nation of China and that I believe is against the interests of North Korea (and also against the interests of South Korea).

The situation in the Korean peninsula is precarious and volatile, so people who live in South Korea would rather prefer some kind of modus vivendi with our unstable and dangerous neighbor rather than cornering it to the brink and waiting to see what happens. In my opinion, maximum pressure just to wait and see would be a dangerous gambit for it increases chances of misunderstanding and some foolish actions from either parties. 

I consider myself a liberal and I am thankful that I was born in a liberal country like South Korea and I am deeply against the North Korean regime, I despise its nature, its cult of personality and its heinous abuses on ordinary citizens, yet I believe that it is not in our interest to raise human rights issue every time we negotiate with them. For example, the US and other Western nations have no problem dealing with Saudi Arabia (another notorious regime), Turkey, Russia and China. It would be utterly hypocritical to deny recognition of NK solely on the grounds of human rights. Therefore, it is beyond me why some American media should be so obsessed with North Korean human rights when they are neglecting the same issues in Saudi Arabia or in Israel. Of course, Human rights and individual liberties are important but raising those issues at this moment would not be very helpful. If history has taught us anything, living conditions and individual liberties are better promoted by active engagement and economic growth. Alexis de Tocqueville has also said that oppressive regimes fall not when they are most oppressive but when they try to reform themselves. 

On the other hand, I'd like to stress that America's posture (especially those of the media) towards North Korea is not very constructive. Unilateral imposition of one's will is not diplomacy, it is a diktat. The US could force unilateral disarmament if it overruns North Korea in a full-fledged war but that is not the case. We are negotiating and North Korea has also interests which it deems vital. 19th century Europeans have been acutely aware of this fact. Diplomacy was the art of the possible, not a crusade to impose one's will. 

Of course, North Korean nukes are a threat and they must be contained, but you cannot contain them with sanctions and pressure alone. We have tried that medicine for decades but they have not worked. And as more time is wasted (without a deal), the more deadly they become. So we need to point the very core issues which have brought about this crisis in the first place. I believe that our government and Trump's administration were addressing those factors (previous to the Hanoi Summit) to finally make a workable settlement on the Korean peninsula. 

Another issue I'd like to address, is that so often, American media portrays South Korean liberals as some kind of anti-american left wing crusaders when they are not. The main support base of the current liberal government are middle-class, students and professionals. We are the most pro-Western, pro-American generation of all, and the culture of individualism and democracy is deeply ingrained in our hearts. In fact, Korean right-wing elderly share more in common with the average North Korean (insofar as they support a strong leader, collectivism, and fervent ethnic nationalism) than the younger generation. So Korean liberals are not anti-american at all, we just want to have a fairer treatment and we want our interests be acknowledged. 

I believe that Russia is also a key player which should be reckoned with. The main rival, perhaps the only rival for the United States is China. And I as a South Korean (as well as the majority of our population) am deeply anxious about the possibility of a Chinese hegemony in the region. Therefore, I believe that it is of utmost importance to come to terms with Russia in order to contain China, just like Nixon did with Mao's China to deal with the USSR. In the process, I think that pipelines and railroads connecting South Korea via North Korea to Russia is important so that we could import cheap energy and be able to invest in Russia. I believe Russia would be more friendly to South Korean firms and capital rather than Chinese since we do not pose a threat to Russia's interests. 

In addition, I believe that if a pipeline connecting Russia and South Korea were to be built, Russia could have a restraining effect on North Korea's behavior. Given that natural gas is the main source of income for the Russian state, they will exert pressure on North Korea if it behaves badly and becomes a detriment for one of its best customers. A Russo-South Korean pipeline will be a win-win scenario for all parties involved: South Korea gets cheap gas, Russia gets additional revenue, and North Korea can exact transit fees. In the process, I believe we could lessen North Korea's dependence on China and make them some kind of a new Vietnam: A potentially useful ally against Chinese expansion. 

Of course, this might also be in the realm of wishful-thinking but I believe it would be a worthy option to try. I believe South Korea and the United States should in the short term, freeze North Korea's nuclear program rather than complete dismantling (which is unrealistic anyways), and then proceed with normalization of relations and open mutually profitable projects which focuses on the economy. Without nukes, North Korea would be completely exposed to a potential Chinese aggression and they may not feel compelled to come to terms with us, not because they think we are going to invade them but because they could become defenseless against a third party also. Therefore, North Korea may retain some capabilities (albeit with limitations) for the time being.

The North Korean question is perhaps the greatest riddle of East Asia which has the potential to completely change the power dynamics in the region. We need a great deal of imagination and caution as well as innovation when it comes to this difficult problem.

9a0y1e,A follow up to my previous thread in regards to the North Korean situation.,"Which is here-
https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/96szci/why_is_it_that_people_think_that_there_will_never/

But,I have several more questions that relate to how there are some things in this whole situation that just bug the ever-living daylights out of me.

First off,we all know that China has an MDT with NK...so my billion-dollar question is **Why is China treated like they're extraneous? As in,if the U.S goes ahead with Military action they would turn a blind eye to it and China would just sit in the corner and sulk,so to speak?**

The media thinks like this,our esteemed ""politicians"" make this a quite *dangerous* assumption and I even see it here on reddit(especially here on geopolitics!) 

Let's be perfectly honest here,China has:

-An rapidly modernizing,vast military

-More powerful and dangerous nuclear ordnance

So,I don't think we need war with China anytime soon(In a manner of speaking.) 

So,why is it that people seem to think Xi/China won't give a crap,when we would,say cause him to deal with a refugee Armageddon(and his country possibly losing not one but TWO important trading partners to NK retaliation:SK and Japan...and I don't think they'll be too enthused about having U.S troops on their doorstep too.)

-And also,why is South Korea,of all people ALSO being treated like they don't matter? I mean,so yes,we all know that if things go tits up with NK,Seoul is done(so to speak..). However,do we really believe that the South Koreans will just roll over and give up? What do you think the U.S did after 9/11? We lost two buildings and 3,000+ people that day and look what happened to Afghanistan and Iraq...South Korea WILL be out for blood..North Korean blood,that is.(And if NK uses a nuke..then they're finished,full stop.)

Again,why(the media and our politicians,namely Trump and Bolton) treat them like they don't matter I have ZERO idea.

-And also..you guys aren't gonna believe this,but...In a way,If North Korea gives up it's nukes..then what on earth are they supposed to do if,say China sees them as a liability that they no longer need and decides to invade them?
(Crazier things have happened in the world.) With a huge army with museum-piece equipment? China would crush them in days! I mean,why can't we see the bigger picture?:We could use NK as more of a means to contain China(wishful thinking,but still..)

It's Like,we want to have NK give up the very thing that will keep them alive,without giving them even a suggestion on how to defend themselves if China decides to lose their minds and go after them.

And also,IF(maybe,and I hope to god I'm wrong about this,When) a war happens,then Korea in general,Japan(if and when NK decides to throw a nuke their way) and to a lesser extent,China..is it ""over"" for them,as in they'll be done as economic powers?
I mean,that has been something I threw around a bit back in the day,East asia ending up like Africa(As in the more worse off nations of Africa) and I see it as hyperbole,but...will they be THAT screwed? I mean,are we talking about 30> years of recovery?
Are we gonna be talking about G-6,or something?

I read a lot of dire predictions about a second korean war,And I'm thinking..it won't be good and that is a massive understatement!
I mean,is it me,Or do Just not a lot of people care about a second Korean conflict or what it will do to East asia?
It certainly looks that way:Lindsey Graham's remarks,the views of people that posted on some of mine and other NK-related threads on here and Quora that think that a Second Korean Conflict will just be a overnight affair...

If I was in either Seoul or Tokyo,I wouldn't be sleeping too soundly,that's for sure,but that's just me.


TL;DR:I have NO idea why everyone thinks SK and China are irrelevant(I'm pointing the finger at you Trump and Bolton) And I have NO idea why people think it's worth WWIII to stop NK's nuclear program.
SK and China are two nations that have made it VERY clear (especially and namely China)that they don't want any military conflict...and even if a conflict does happen,what can we do? East Asia will just be well...screwed and that'll be the end of it,no?

Why be scared/concerned over something we can't stop anymore than we can stop a Earthquake or hurricane?",Hayate_Immelmann_,geopolitics,0,7,1535142921,/r/geopolitics/comments/9a0y1e/a_follow_up_to_my_previous_thread_in_regards_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/9a0y1e/a_follow_up_to_my_previous_thread_in_regards_to/,post,nk,2025-12-09 00:35:42

945zz1,Trying to Understand the North Korean Situation..,"Even though things have reached a stabilization point(for the time being,anyway),There are still some things that I still don't really get about the North Korean situation...And I'm hoping folks here can help me understand some things here..Or at least point me in the right direction where I can get some understanding of this whole situation.

**WARNING:Some of these questions may be stupid questions/hyperbolic,so I apologize in advance,but there is a LOT of crazy stuff being said about NK and their nukes...**

(Main questions are bolded)

So with that said,here's my heap of questions:

1-Given that NO ONE(and I mean NO ONE...I see that on this very subbreddit too) trusts NK or their intentions,Is war is the only way to stop NK's Nuclear program? is risking WWIII with China(and possibly Russia) and sending the world into a new dark age(Japan eating a third nuke,Seoul being brutalized by NK arty AND nukes? Hello global depression that makes 1929 look like a drop in the bucket!) the only way to end NK's nuclear ambitions once and for all?

**The media,our politicians(Namely lindsey Graham) and many people seem to think so. So what are we really gonna be looking at?**

2-Lindsey Graham..what on god's green earth is wrong with this guy? I mean,every single time he's spoken about NK...he's even more of a NK hawk than Bolton and Pompeo could ever be! I mean,does this guy have an special hatred of Korea/Koreans in general? it seems like this guy doesn't mind if the Korean peninsula ends up a wasteland for the rest of humanity's existence! I mean,he seems to want war with NK more than even trump himself!

**So,what is Graham's angle? He's said nothing about Iran,yet he seems to want to see the Korean peninsula turned into a hole in the ground that badly? What's with this guy? I well and truly don't understand this man at all..**

3-The capabilities of North Korea in general...are we really that hopeless and helpless to stop NK before Seoul gets turned into a killing field? Are our missile defense systems really that useless to the point that we may even see a nuclear mushroom over say,Los Angeles and/or San Francisco? Things are making it seem that NK holds all the cards and we can't really do anything about them.(Again,the words of the media,politicians and other folks elsewhere on the internet,not necessarily mine.)

**Are we really that screwed against NK and their missiles?**

4-The massive disconnect between public opinion and the Media/experts/politicians..Why is it that(namely) South Koreans think that war will never happen with NK in any lifetime? I mean,you have experts,politicians,the media all saying war could happen with varying possibilities/probabilities(And can still happen,especially if Trump feels like Mueller is gonna have him dead to rights..)..and yet there are those in SK who think war won't happen..at all.

If Trump decides to go berserk on NK,who's gonna stop him? China?Russia? the U.N? South Korea(lol)? Congress (lmao)?
No wonder they say that millions could die..it seems like SK will never see it coming when NK goes berserk themselves.
(And Japan is just as screwed..I mean,if our BMD systems are really that useless,then god help Japan,is all that I'll say.)

**So,why is it that people are that naive?**

5-Why is North Korea so oversold and feared,when you have...**Russia**,who has:

-Actively interfered with U.S elections

-Has far more dangerous nuclear weapons and far more reliable means of delivering them

-Has actually done more concerning(in a manner of speaking) things(invading sovereign nations,involved in the downing of a airliner,killing people on foreign soil,etc.) 


**And yet,we have to be scared of North Korea..why?**



TL;DR:
Again,I'm sorry if my questions are stupid and/or hyperbolic,but this situation scares me in a way(though not as much as a couple months back),and all I have is just question after question and there are some(if not a lot) of things that just don't add up.
I believe that to no longer be afraid of something,you must understand how it works,IMO.

So,I hope you guys don't attack me too much....

P.S:Anyone wonder why we have to be scared of things we can't control,like nuclear war?
why does the media/our politicians always have to do that to us? I mean,what do they want us regular citizens to do?

What progress towards US objectives has been made since the last official summit?,"Sarah Sanders has confirmed that Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un will meet in February at a location to be confirmed at a later date.

This is being reported by [Axios](https://www.axios.com/second-trump-kim-summit-february-c83f07eb-4620-4db8-a706-7722a0a3f528.html) as well as the Voice of America, which was picked up by [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2019/1/18/18186799/north-korea-trump-kim-summit-nuclear).

President Trump held the first ever meeting between a US President and North Korea in [June of 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_North_Korea%E2%80%93United_States_summit). This will be the second meeting between Kim Jon Un and Trump.

There has been reporting that [North Korea has little intention of dismantling their nuclear weapons program](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/us/politics/north-korea-missile-bases.html) because they continue to made improvements to their existing facilities.

8qk43v,What are the historical implications of the Trump/Kim Summit as it relates to denuclearization and the halting of joint-military exercises?,"This morning it was announced that Kim Jung-Un would commit to [""complete denuclearization""](https://nypost.com/2018/06/12/kim-jong-un-commits-to-complete-denuclearization-of-the-korean-peninsula-document/) as part of a joint-document he signed with Donald Trump. In return, the United States would halt [joint-military exercises with South Korea](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/world/asia/trump-military-exercises-north-south-korea.html). It should be mentioned that Kim had [already pledged denuclearization](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/27/606264786/peace-at-hand-korean-leaders-meet-for-historic-border-handshake) back in April with a meeting with South Korea's leader.

As a result, many people have pointed out that historically, [Kim has made similar pledges but backed out on them.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/09/asia/north-korean-denuclearization-promises/index.html) 

I have several questions as it relates to this summit.

1) What makes this pledge from Kim different from previous pledges?

2) If Kim backs out on his pledge, and we no longer have troops in South Korea, what are our options from a geopolitical standpoint?

3) Is the document signed by Kim and Trump a document of substance, or a document for the media? Is there anything binding in that document that holds each nation to it's pledges?",AFlaccoSeagulls,NeutralPolitics,596,212,1528819266,/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/8qk43v/what_are_the_historical_implications_of_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/8qk43v/what_are_the_historical_implications_of_the/,post,nk,2025-12-09 00:35:42
