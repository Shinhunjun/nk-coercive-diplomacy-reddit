164,bspbvl,CHINA,Did China overlook ideological differences? The democratic world is teaming up on the CCP,"I was very skeptical of Trump, that China will come out on top of this trade war, with Europe and Canada being more pro-China. However it doesn't seem like the case. Both US and China are suffering from trade war but I do believe China is suffering more. My Chinese stocks are going down and I sold them all. The problem is China is simply too reliant on foreign markets in order to function effectively.

&#x200B;

Despite the desire for free trade, it seems like the EU and Canada and Australia and being pro-US despite it not benefiting their economies. A good example is the Canadian ban on Huawei, it will help the Canadian tech industry a lot, the security of alliance with US trumps it. Australian politicians are growing more and more worried about China despite it being such a large partner with China.

If you have been watching comments by Steve Bannon, this is purely ideological not diplomatic. Men like Bannon hate the fact China is a command economy and rising. China is not a huge threat on American security, but a threat on the American identity *of what nation should be* and democracies from Japan to Germany are supporting America on this.

This is not a ""raw raw China bad"" post but it shows a alternative-realist perspective where it is not only about economics, but a fight for identity and cultural power. US is at a point where it doesn't need Mid-East oil, it has automation to replace foreign workers and factories, and has a fairly self-sufficient tech industry. The anti-China actions represents a ideological battle than a battle for resources.",,,,

>By signaling, albeit inadvertently, that America wisely lacks the  appetite for a war of choice—or even worse, a war on behalf of Saudi  Arabia and the UAE—with Iran, Trump may have opened a window of  opportunity for indigenously driven diplomacy in the region by simply  stepping aside.

>The irony of all this is, in the last thirty years, America has fought  Iran’s wars and mopped up Iran’s enemies, significantly ensuring the  survival of the Mullahs.

[https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/iran/u-s-offered-to-remove-all-sanctions-in-exchange-for-talks-iran-s-rohani-says-1.7915191](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/iran/u-s-offered-to-remove-all-sanctions-in-exchange-for-talks-iran-s-rohani-says-1.7915191)

>The United States offered to remove all sanctions on Iran in exchange  for talks but Tehran has not yet accepted the offer due to the current  ""toxic atmosphere"", Iranian President Hassan Rohani said on Friday.  
>  
>However, U.S. President Donald Trump has since negated Rohani in a  tweet, claiming the Iranians asked him to lift the sanctions in order to  meet, and he refused.

It looks to me like Iran is in a much better condition than the US for diplomatic negotiations. Following the removal of the Iran deal, most major nations have ignored America's sanctions and maintained trade with them, therefore undermining US leverage. If that's the case, could the Trump administration intentionally or unintentionally setting up the stage for Iran to have stronger leverage in future diplomatic talks? Could this administration possibly lead to the opening of diplomatic doors on Iran's part?",,,,
