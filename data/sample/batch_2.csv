303,cg3m7f,CHINA,Is America's conflict with Iran about killing the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative?,"China plans to [connect to Europe](https://www.bunkerist.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/comm-mapping-the-belt-and-road-initiatives-progress-08312018-LG.png) with its Belt and Road Initiative. As you can see, the land route travels through Iran, Turkey, eastward to Moscow, and back over to the rest of Europe. This got me thinking: could the US purposefully be escalating tensions with Iran in order to kill the BRI?

The US has put sanctions on Iran. At this point, Iran is practically begging for sanction relief. The common consensus is that the US is putting sanctions on Iran in order to create dissatisfaction with the current regime among the Iranian people, possibly leading to a revolution that will install a more democratic and pro-US government. This would lead to Iran being less inclined to work with China. If the sanctions don't work, the US can always use its military to invade, but that would be a last resort.

If Iran is no longer willing to cooperate with China's ambitions, the only other option left for the BRI's land route would be to travel through Russia into Eastern Europe, where the US has much more influence than in Southeast Europe.

Could this be America's plan to stop China from surpassing it economically?",,,,
