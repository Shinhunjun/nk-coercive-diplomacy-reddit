bspbvl,Did China overlook ideological differences? The democratic world is teaming up on the CCP,"I was very skeptical of Trump, that China will come out on top of this trade war, with Europe and Canada being more pro-China. However it doesn't seem like the case. Both US and China are suffering from trade war but I do believe China is suffering more. My Chinese stocks are going down and I sold them all. The problem is China is simply too reliant on foreign markets in order to function effectively.

&#x200B;

Despite the desire for free trade, it seems like the EU and Canada and Australia and being pro-US despite it not benefiting their economies. A good example is the Canadian ban on Huawei, it will help the Canadian tech industry a lot, the security of alliance with US trumps it. Australian politicians are growing more and more worried about China despite it being such a large partner with China.

If you have been watching comments by Steve Bannon, this is purely ideological not diplomatic. Men like Bannon hate the fact China is a command economy and rising. China is not a huge threat on American security, but a threat on the American identity *of what nation should be* and democracies from Japan to Germany are supporting America on this.

This is not a ""raw raw China bad"" post but it shows a alternative-realist perspective where it is not only about economics, but a fight for identity and cultural power. US is at a point where it doesn't need Mid-East oil, it has automation to replace foreign workers and factories, and has a fairly self-sufficient tech industry. The anti-China actions represents a ideological battle than a battle for resources.",Warriormind556,geopolitics,2,49,1558749889,/r/geopolitics/comments/bspbvl/did_china_overlook_ideological_differences_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/bspbvl/did_china_overlook_ideological_differences_the/,P3_PostHanoi,china,2025-12-08 10:57:24,ECONOMIC,0.85,"The post discusses the trade war between the US and China, focusing on the economic implications and the reliance of China on foreign markets.",-0.5168538093566895,negative,,2019-05-25 02:04:49,2019-05,CHINA,2025-12-09 00:21:35

>By signaling, albeit inadvertently, that America wisely lacks the  appetite for a war of choice—or even worse, a war on behalf of Saudi  Arabia and the UAE—with Iran, Trump may have opened a window of  opportunity for indigenously driven diplomacy in the region by simply  stepping aside.

>However, U.S. President Donald Trump has since negated Rohani in a  tweet, claiming the Iranians asked him to lift the sanctions in order to  meet, and he refused.

It looks to me like Iran is in a much better condition than the US for diplomatic negotiations. Following the removal of the Iran deal, most major nations have ignored America's sanctions and maintained trade with them, therefore undermining US leverage. If that's the case, could the Trump administration intentionally or unintentionally setting up the stage for Iran to have stronger leverage in future diplomatic talks? Could this administration possibly lead to the opening of diplomatic doors on Iran's part?",illegalmorality,geopolitics,11,15,1569818753,/r/geopolitics/comments/db6kvn/what_are_the_chances_of_the_trump_administration/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/db6kvn/what_are_the_chances_of_the_trump_administration/,P3_PostHanoi,iran,2025-12-12 17:32:45,DIPLOMACY,0.8,"The post discusses the potential for normalization of relations and diplomacy between the U.S. and Iran, indicating a focus on negotiations and easing tensions.",-0.095940962433815,neutral,2.0,2019-09-30 04:45:53,2019-09,IRAN,

cg3m7f,Is America's conflict with Iran about killing the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative?,"China plans to [connect to Europe](https://www.bunkerist.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/comm-mapping-the-belt-and-road-initiatives-progress-08312018-LG.png) with its Belt and Road Initiative. As you can see, the land route travels through Iran, Turkey, eastward to Moscow, and back over to the rest of Europe. This got me thinking: could the US purposefully be escalating tensions with Iran in order to kill the BRI?

The US has put sanctions on Iran. At this point, Iran is practically begging for sanction relief. The common consensus is that the US is putting sanctions on Iran in order to create dissatisfaction with the current regime among the Iranian people, possibly leading to a revolution that will install a more democratic and pro-US government. This would lead to Iran being less inclined to work with China. If the sanctions don't work, the US can always use its military to invade, but that would be a last resort.

If Iran is no longer willing to cooperate with China's ambitions, the only other option left for the BRI's land route would be to travel through Russia into Eastern Europe, where the US has much more influence than in Southeast Europe.

Could this be America's plan to stop China from surpassing it economically?",ShingekiNoEren,geopolitics,89,59,1563740702,/r/geopolitics/comments/cg3m7f/is_americas_conflict_with_iran_about_killing_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/cg3m7f/is_americas_conflict_with_iran_about_killing_the/,P3_PostHanoi,china,2025-12-12 17:19:33,NEUTRAL,0.5,Error: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0),-0.4008728563785553,neutral,0.0,2019-07-21 20:25:02,2019-07,CHINA,

9achn8,US-China Trade War as a Scapegoat for Failed NK Progress?,">***“I explained to the President of China that a trade deal with the U.S. will be far better for them if they solve the North Korean problem!”***  
>  
>\- Trump, April, 2017  [\[New York Times\]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/world/asia/trump-china-trade-north-korea.html)

​

China fell for the bait. Since April, 2017, China has enforced toughest UNSC sanction regime in history. Even according to Trump, China's help was instrumental in bringing North Korea to the negotiating table and bringing the Singapore summit into fruition.

​

China thought it did it's part in bringing NK to the peace table, but it got burned badly after Trump reneged on it's promise and slapped HUGE tariffs on Chinese imports. (With friends like this, who needs enemies?)

​

From China's perspective, it seems that Trump backstabbed China once China's usefullness expired (e.g. after NK was brought to negotiating table, Trump dumped China, and went back on their promise).

​

This leads me to two scenarios:

​

1. Trump genuinely thinks it can persuade China to denuclearize NK in exchange for ""better trade deal"". The Carrot & Stick approach to China.

​

OR

​

2.  Trump is using Trade War as a excuse to blame China for the failure of progression on US-NK denuclearization talks, because Trump had no hopes for it going anywhere in the first place, and needs a scapegoat.

​

The US-China trade gap is not relevant to addressing the underlying issue behind NK's ""siege mentality"" and insecurity about it's regimes survival, so it's like linking two issues that doesn't solve the underlying problem.

c5q2ug,Inside the West’s failed fight against China’s ‘Cloud Hopper’ hackers,"&#x200B;

>The hacking campaign, known as “Cloud Hopper,” was the subject of a U.S. indictment in December that accused two Chinese nationals of identity theft and fraud. Prosecutors described an elaborate operation that victimized multiple Western companies but stopped short of naming them. A Reuters report at the time identified two: Hewlett Packard Enterprise and IBM.  
>  
>Yet the campaign ensnared at least six more major technology firms, touching five of the world’s 10 biggest tech service providers.

&#x200B;

>Also compromised by Cloud Hopper, Reuters has found: Fujitsu, Tata Consultancy Services, NTT Data, Dimension Data, Computer Sciences Corporation and DXC Technology. HPE spun-off its services arm in a merger with Computer Sciences Corporation in 2017 to create DXC.  
>  
>Waves of hacking victims emanate from those six plus HPE and IBM: their clients. Ericsson, which competes with Chinese firms in the strategically critical mobile telecoms business, is one. Others include travel reservation system Sabre, the American leader in managing plane bookings, and the largest shipbuilder for the U.S. Navy, Huntington Ingalls Industries, which builds America’s nuclear submarines at a Virginia shipyard.  
>  
>**“This was the theft of industrial or commercial secrets for the purpose of advancing an economy,” said former Australian National Cyber Security Adviser Alastair MacGibbon. “The lifeblood of a company.”**

bmkwzl,What is Russia’s over arching goal or plan in geopolitics?

It cozy’s with any US enemy it sees fit, has ambition for grander military (annexing Crimea for warm water port), and building up more upgraded military, but at the same time, it seems to be perfectly happy letting China be the main hidden power while it takes all the news. Does Russia help China to be the main superpower solely become of its hate to the US? 

Russian generals have expressed the governments weird spending habits- noting how the navy is neglected with one cattier always getting towed but all this international pressure in Crimea because of the navy militants. Yet, Russia goes toward the rockets and nuke route. While it’s inventory of massive amounts of tanks sits idell. 

So what does Russia want? Be the superpower? Make China superpower? Just be throne in the “west’s” side? In that case, honestly, can Russia even says it not the west anymore?
