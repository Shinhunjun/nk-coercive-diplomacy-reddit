I realize both export and sell large quantities of weapons to Sudan, but surely there must be a deeper reasoning for this. It doesn't seem like arms sales would be enough for two large powers to block actions.

>  
>\- Trump, April, 2017  [\[New York Times\]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/world/asia/trump-china-trade-north-korea.html)

​

China fell for the bait. Since April, 2017, China has enforced toughest UNSC sanction regime in history. Even according to Trump, China's help was instrumental in bringing North Korea to the negotiating table and bringing the Singapore summit into fruition.

​

China thought it did it's part in bringing NK to the peace table, but it got burned badly after Trump reneged on it's promise and slapped HUGE tariffs on Chinese imports. (With friends like this, who needs enemies?)

​

From China's perspective, it seems that Trump backstabbed China once China's usefullness expired (e.g. after NK was brought to negotiating table, Trump dumped China, and went back on their promise).

​

This leads me to two scenarios:

​

1. Trump genuinely thinks it can persuade China to denuclearize NK in exchange for ""better trade deal"". The Carrot & Stick approach to China.

​

OR

​

2.  Trump is using Trade War as a excuse to blame China for the failure of progression on US-NK denuclearization talks, because Trump had no hopes for it going anywhere in the first place, and needs a scapegoat.

​

The US-China trade gap is not relevant to addressing the underlying issue behind NK's ""siege mentality"" and insecurity about it's regimes survival, so it's like linking two issues that doesn't solve the underlying problem.
