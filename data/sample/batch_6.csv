Just blatant anti-America or is there more to it?,"While any history student could answer what USSR’s goal was: Communism- after the 2000’s, it’s not quite clear what Russia wants. It cozy’s with any US enemy it sees fit, has ambition for grander military (annexing Crimea for warm water port), and building up more upgraded military, but at the same time, it seems to be perfectly happy letting China be the main hidden power while it takes all the news. Does Russia help China to be the main superpower solely become of its hate to the US? 

Russian generals have expressed the governments weird spending habits- noting how the navy is neglected with one cattier always getting towed but all this international pressure in Crimea because of the navy militants. Yet, Russia goes toward the rockets and nuke route. While it’s inventory of massive amounts of tanks sits idell. 

So what does Russia want? Be the superpower? Make China superpower? Just be throne in the “west’s” side? In that case, honestly, can Russia even says it not the west anymore? Like sure corruption exist but like Italy and Greece exist as well. I do t actually think Russia is that much different than a normal Central European nation.

1318,bmdua5,IRAN,How does Iran current economical situation compare to the days of the previous sanctions (before Iran deal in 2015)?,"I was wondering how effective this campaign of 'maximum pressure' from Trump's administration really is. Been wanting to compare the two situations for awhile now in terms of GDP (adjusted to inflation and expected growth if not for sanctions), currency exchange rate and so on. But I'm just not that economic-savvy to know where to find reliable data.

Anyone has a clue or compared the two recently?",,,,
