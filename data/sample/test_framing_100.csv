http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/defense/326094-how-north-korea-could-kill-up-to-90-percent-of-americans-at-any

The article's thrust is that North Korea is:

1. Capable of miniaturizing a nuclear warhead
2. Capable of creating an ICBM to deliver that warhead
3. Able to combine those capabilities to create an EMP shock that knocks out the national powergrid

Furthermore the article cites the Congressional EMP commission's [report](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110hhrg45133/pdf/CHRG-110hhrg45133.pdf) that theorizes  the ensuing chaos could *kill 9 in 10 Americans*.

My initial reaction is that the conclusions seem wildly exaggerated, but the author of the editorial is chief of staff of said EMP commission and I certainly don't have detailed knowledge on this question.

So, two questions:

1. How accurate are the authors assessments of North Korea's nuclear capabilities?
2.

Furthermore the article cites the Congressional EMP commission's [report](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110hhrg45133/pdf/CHRG-110hhrg45133.pdf) that theorizes  the ensuing chaos could *kill 9 in 10 Americans*.

My initial reaction is that the conclusions seem wildly exaggerated, but the author of the editorial is chief of staff of said EMP commission and I certainly don't have detailed knowledge on this question.

So, two questions:

1. How accurate are the authors assessments of North Korea's nuclear capabilities?
2. How credible is the author's claims that an EMP would a) knockout the entire US grid and b) lead to mass casualties?",0.3659941554069519,0.6057579517364502,0.0282479524612426,-0.3377462029457092,-0.3377462029457092,THREAT,0.95,"제목과 내용 모두 북한의 핵 능력이 미국 안보에 미치는 위협의 심각성에 초점을 맞추고 있으며, 미국 전력망을 마비시킬 수 있는 EMP 공격 가능성을 언급하여 위협적인 상황을 강조하고 있습니다."

65o0zu,My thoughts on North Korea's nuclear ambitions and the limits of US and Chinese influence,My thoughts on North Korea's nuclear ambitions and the limits of US and Chinese influence,"So, we all know what's been happening with North Korea in the last few days, and the statements which the US and China have been making on the matter. On this sub, and reddit overall, some threads have popped up asking why North Korea wants nukes or why they're so crazy or why they hate the US so much (or something like that). 

I thought I'd give my two cents on this matter as well. While reading this, please keep in mind that I don't have any sympathy for North Korea and obviously have no desire for them to acquire nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles and also view much of their actions as destabilizing, but to get to the core of the matter we need to treat North Korea's actions and beliefs in a detached manner.

--------------------------------

Much of the discussion have revolved around what can be done to prevent NK from getting nukes, short of military force. US exercises of deterrence and Chinese influence and sanctions are often cited along the lines of what may help to prevent NK from testing a nuke or a missile and keep fatty Kim from being too crazy, and eventually to get NK to abandon their nuclear ambitions overall one day, peacefully.

Unfortunately, I believe such a prospect is unlikely, if we take a step back and consider why North Korea actually wants nukes. 

Is it because North Korea wants to have the ability to strike the US or Japan because Kim and his associates have brain washed themselves into hating them? Is it because North Korea wants nukes to hold the world to nuclear ransom? Is it because North Korea wants to have some way of taking over South Korea? 

I think all of those are possible, but in the eyes of Kim, I believe those are all vastly smaller secondary reasons compared to the primary reason, which I think most media and geopolitical discourse does not sufficiently cover.

And I believe that reason is self preservation. Fear. 

During the Cold War, prior to the USSR's dissolution, NK was effectively under the protection of the USSR, not only economically but to a degree militarily. NK knew it's survival was partly guaranteed by the strength of the USSR-US geopolitical struggle.

But between the early 1990s to the 2000s, two significant geopolitical events occurred, related to NK's self perceived security.

* First was the significant dissolution of NK's sense of diplomatic and geopolitical support and security, due to the dissolution of the USSR (though the USSR had begun to wind down their relationship with NK by the late Cold War anyway), but also due to China's significant economic re-orientation and integration with the rest of the world, leaving NK very diplomatically and geopolitically isolated. In the span of under a decade, NK realized it was basically alone, facing an economically and technologically powerful South Korea with the backing and support of the US, not to mention other allies like Japan, and even more distant countries like Australia, UK and New Zealand. 

* Secondly, was the US and the west's wielding of significant military power to conduct interventions, invasions, and regime change in a number of nations in the post Cold War era. The 2003 invasion of Iraq being probably one of the most primary examples, but the first Gulf War and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and the subsequent events in that country probably shook NK's government and then Kim Jong Il quite substantially. More recent events like the coalition against Libya, and the US stance towards countries like Iran have probably caused such a fear to take a more permanent hold of the younger, current Kim. 

I believe that those two changes put together, along with the many decade long mutual animosity between NK with the US+SK, created a sense of significant fear in the Kim government that they would effectively be ""next"". Being listed on GWB's modern ""axis of evil"" in 2002 definitely did not help their sense of security. 

I believe the Kim government believed their only way of attaining security for themselves that they could guarantee for themselves, against a foe far more powerful than themselves -- i.e.: the US -- was by having nukes.

What resulted from 2006 when NK conducted its first nuclear test, was a self feeding circle where the US and its allies in SK and Japan have conducted very significant military exercises on or near the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea provocations whether they are nuclear tests or missile tests, or things like sinking a SK corvette or shelling a SK village. NK in turn views those exercises as dress rehearsals for decapitation strikes against Kim and his cronies as well as regime change against NK akin to what the US has done quite successfully in quite a number of times over the last few decades around the world, thus further accelerating their nuclear ambitions.

The key take away, I think, is that NK and Kim likely sees their nukes and the ability to launch them to the continental US as a vital requirement for their very survival. No one wants them to get nukes, whether it's the US, China, SK, Japan, Russia, or whomever. But NK really, really, really wants them and from their point of view they need them to survive.

From there, I think it becomes obvious to see why the current policy vectors of the US and China will not stop NK's goal for nukes. 

* For the US, the primary policy to NK's nukes is basically via high profile military displays with allies. Sanctions, whether it's from US and its allies or via UN have little to no effect anymore, so the last card to repeatedly play is via military actions to deter NK from acting up too much and to try to dissuade NK from further nuclear testing. Of course, there have been reports that the US have been using cyber warfare to sabotage NK's missile tests, and I consider that to be very likely and credible. But none of these actions produce a policy that are able to dissuade NK from developing nukes, and if anything they are likely to further strengthen Kim's siege mentality and strengthen their determination to develop nukes. Cyber warfare will put NK's missiles back years and years, but they will likely get there eventually, because their resolve will remain due to their fundamental fear for their own survival.

* For China, it's a bit more complicated because obviously everyone knows not only China's actions are limited due to the risk of a NK collapse causing a flood of refugees into its borders, but also because China fears the geopolitical consequence of a NK collapse where they may lose a vital buffer against the US allied South Korea and may end up facing US ground forces across the Yalu, which of course was the whole reason why China got into the original Korean War to begin with. But, on top of all of that, I believe even if China further cracked down on trade with North Korea and applying political pressure North Korea as the US and Trump has wished, that would not produce the desired result of getting NK to stop its nuclear and missile programmes, partly because China already lacks any substantial political influence over NK since about the late 2000s, but also because it would further show them that China cannot be counted on as even a vague security guarantee and they would seek nukes even more to guarantee their own survival against the US. A very real possibility that China needs to face as well, is if China economically punishes NK too much then NK may end up even pointing a few of its nukes towards China as well if they feel China has turned on them. 

-----------------------------------

So, I think a peaceful resolution to North Korea's nuclear ambitions is very unlikely. That's because the primary fundamental rationale behind NK's nuclear ambition is to preserve its own survival due to their perception of existential threat from the US -- their requirement for nukes is to achieve one of deterrence (though I admit using that word for North Korea who seem so cartoonishly evil and unstable is a little bit strange to type). 

The only way for NK to relinquish its nukes willingly and peacefully, in my opinion, is if there were some sort of grand bargain where NK is 110% sure that the US would not threaten them and more importantly if NK did not perceive the US would **ever** be a threat to them.

But obviously such an arrangement is geopolitically ridiculous, as the North's requirements for such an arrangement will obviously not be acceptable to the US for a whole multitude of reasons and likely involve substantial reduction if not total withdrawal of US forces in Northeast Asia if not the whole of East Asia, and even then it probably would not be enough for NK because they would see the US's ability to easily redeploy back into theatre via naval and airlift as a big threat. The US, for its part, would rightly see any such action as giving up on allies like SK and Japan, as well as opening SK up to attack by the North, and may likely feel NK won't hold its end of the bargain, not to mention the associated loss of geopolitical influence in a key region which its military assets there help to provide, US geopolitical credibility worldwide etc, and the list just goes on and on.

(And to be frank, the very notion of NK and the US sitting down at the table with each other as anything like equals is likely anathema to anyone and everyone in the US government.)

US exercises of deterrence and Chinese influence and sanctions are often cited along the lines of what may help to prevent NK from testing a nuke or a missile and keep fatty Kim from being too crazy, and eventually to get NK to abandon their nuclear ambitions overall one day, peacefully. Unfortunately, I believe such a prospect is unlikely, if we take a step back and consider why North Korea actually wants nukes. Is it because North Korea wants to have the ability to strike the US or Japan because Kim and his associates have brain washed themselves into hating them? Is it because North Korea wants nukes to hold the world to nuclear ransom? Is it because North Korea wants to have some way of taking over South Korea? I think all of those are possible, but in the eyes of Kim, I believe those are all vastly smaller secondary reasons compared to the primary reason, which I think most media and geopolitical discourse does not sufficiently cover. And I believe that reason is self preservation. Fear. During the Cold War, prior to the USSR's dissolution, NK was effectively under the protection of the USSR, not only economically but to a degree militarily. NK knew it's survival was partly guaranteed by the strength of the USSR-US geopolitical struggle. But between the early 1990s to the 2000s, two significant geopolitical events occurred, related to NK's self perceived security. First was the significant dissolution of NK's sense of diplomatic and geopolitical support and security, due to the dissolution of the USSR though the USSR had begun to wind down their relationship with NK by the late Cold War anyway , but also due to China's significant economic re-orientation and integration with the rest of the world, leaving NK very diplomatically and geopolitically isolated. In the span of under a decade, NK realized it was basically alone, facing an economically and technologically powerful South Korea with the backing and support of the US, not to mention other allies like Japan, and even more distant countries like Australia, UK and New Zealand. Secondly, was the US and the west's wielding of significant military power to conduct interventions, invasions, and regime change in a number of nations in the post Cold War era. The 2003 invasion of Iraq being probably one of the most primary examples, but the first Gulf War and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and the subsequent events in that country probably shook NK's government and then Kim Jong Il quite substantially. More recent events like the coalition against Libya, and the US stance towards countries like Iran have probably caused such a fear to take a more permanent hold of the younger, current Kim. I believe that those two changes put together, along with the many decade long mutual animosity between NK with the US SK, created a sense of significant fear in the Kim government that they would effectively be ""next"". Being listed on GWB's modern ""axis of evil"" in 2002 definitely did not help their sense of security. I believe the Kim government believed their only way of attaining security for themselves that they could guarantee for themselves, against a foe far more powerful than themselves -- i.e. the US -- was by having nukes. What resulted from 2006 when NK conducted its first nuclear test, was a self feeding circle where the US and its allies in SK and Japan have conducted very significant military exercises on or near the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea provocations whether they are nuclear tests or missile tests, or things like sinking a SK corvette or shelling a SK village. NK in turn views those exercises as dress rehearsals for decapitation strikes against Kim and his cronies as well as regime change against NK akin to what the US has done quite successfully in quite a number of times over the last few decades around the world, thus further accelerating their nuclear ambitions. The key take away, I think, is that NK and Kim likely sees their nukes and the ability to launch them to the continental US as a vital requirement for their very survival. No one wants them to get nukes, whether it's the US, China, SK, Japan, Russia, or whomever. But NK really, really, really wants them and from their point of view they need them to survive. From there, I think it becomes obvious to see why the current policy vectors of the US and China will not stop NK's goal for nukes. For the US, the primary policy to NK's nukes is basically via high profile military displays with allies. Sanctions, whether it's from US and its allies or via UN have little to no effect anymore, so the last card to repeatedly play is via military actions to deter NK from acting up too much and to try to dissuade NK from further nuclear testing. Of course, there have been reports that the US have been using cyber warfare to sabotage NK's missile tests, and I consider that to be very likely and credible. But none of these actions produce a policy that are able to dissuade NK from developing nukes, and if anything they are likely to further strengthen Kim's siege mentality and strengthen their determination to develop nukes. Cyber warfare will put NK's missiles back years and years, but they will likely get there eventually, because their resolve will remain due to their fundamental fear for their own survival. For China, it's a bit more complicated because obviously everyone knows not only China's actions are limited due to the risk of a NK collapse causing a flood of refugees into its borders, but also because China fears the geopolitical consequence of a NK collapse where they may lose a vital buffer against the US allied South Korea and may end up facing US ground forces across the Yalu, which of course was the whole reason why China got into the original Korean War to begin with. But, on top of all of that, I believe even if China further cracked down on trade with North Korea and applying political pressure North Korea as the US and Trump has wished, that would not produce the desired result of getting NK to stop its nuclear and missile programmes, partly because China already lacks any substantial political influence over NK since about the late 2000s, but also because it would further show them that China cannot be counted on as even a vague security guarantee and they would seek nukes even more to guarantee their own survival against the US. A very real possibility that China needs to face as well, is if China economically punishes NK too much then NK may end up even pointing a few of its nukes towards China as well if they feel China has turned on them. ----------------------------------- So, I think a peaceful resolution to North Korea's nuclear ambitions is very unlikely. That's because the primary fundamental rationale behind NK's nuclear ambition is to preserve its own survival due to their perception of existential threat from the US -- their requirement for nukes is to achieve one of deterrence though I admit using that word for North Korea who seem so cartoonishly evil and unstable is a little bit strange to type . The only way for NK to relinquish its nukes willingly and peacefully, in my opinion, is if there were some sort of grand bargain where NK is 110 sure that the US would not threaten them and more importantly if NK did not perceive the US would ever be a threat to them. But obviously such an arrangement is geopolitically ridiculous, as the North's requirements for such an arrangement will obviously not be acceptable to the US for a whole multitude of reasons and likely involve substantial reduction if not total withdrawal of US forces in Northeast Asia if not the whole of East Asia, and even then it probably would not be enough for NK because they would see the US's ability to easily redeploy back into theatre via naval and airlift as a big threat. The US, for its part, would rightly see any such action as giving up on allies like SK and Japan, as well as opening SK up to attack by the North, and may likely feel NK won't hold its end of the bargain, not to mention the associated loss of geopolitical influence in a key region which its military assets there help to provide, US geopolitical credibility worldwide etc, and the list just goes on and on. And to be frank, the very notion of NK and the US sitting down at the table with each other as anything like equals is likely anathema to anyone and everyone in the US government.

66cydq,Has USA have nuclear bombs in South Korea?,Has USA have nuclear bombs in South Korea?,"Hi, I'm trying to form the most possible objective opinion on the Korean problem.

On 1953 USA signed an armistice with the North Korea, but then broke it:

""Paragraph 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement mandated that neither side introduce new weapons into Korea, other than piece-for-piece replacement of equipment. In September 1956 the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Radford indicated that the U.S. military intention was to introduce atomic weapons into Korea, which was agreed to by the U.S. National Security Council and President Eisenhower.[33] However paragraph 13(d) prevented the introduction of nuclear weapons and missiles.[34] The U.S. unilaterally abrogated paragraph 13(d), breaking the Armistice Agreement, despite concerns by United Nations allies.[35][36][37] At a meeting of the Military Armistice Commission on June 21, 1957, the U.S. informed the North Korean representatives that the United Nations Command no longer considered itself bound by paragraph 13(d) of the armistice.[38][39] In January 1958 nuclear armed Honest John missiles and 280mm atomic cannons were deployed to South Korea,[40] a year later adding nuclear armed Matador cruise missiles with the range to reach China and the Soviet Union.[36][41]""

from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Armistice_Agreement


So my question is: USA still have bombs in South Korea? I know that South Korea doesn't have any, but does USA still have them inside their borders, threatening North Korea? 

And second if the answer is positive, wouldn't be a wise choice to propose a peace treaty and the end of the nuclear program (supervised by the UN) with the promise of taking them away from there? Because if this is true, actually justify the North Korean nuclear program from my point of view.","Hi, I'm trying to form the most possible objective opinion on the Korean problem.

68ihv9,"South Korea needs to negotiate with Trump, and change the outdated status of the US-ROK alliance","South Korea needs to negotiate with Trump, and change the outdated status of the US-ROK alliance","This is what I would do if I was Moon Jae-in

1. Sit down with Trump and negotiate the terms to eliminate the US opposition to South Korea's nuclear weapons restrictions. 

2. Also negotiate to eliminate US restrictions on South Korea's right to research and development of cruise missile technology.

3. In return, as soon as South Korea develops their nuclear weapons, America withdraws its troops from South Korea.  

This is a win-win tradeoff for the two countries. South Korea saves money on spending on useless conventional weapons, and America saves $1 billion a year in the stationing of the USFK.

Furthermore, South Korea gets new independence to control its own foreign policy, and the US can now wash their hands off of their South Korean headache.  

This is why Trump is good for Korea. He is turning everything up-side-down, forcing countries and peoples to get rid of the current status quo in North Korea.  Trump may sound like a crazy crude madman, but one thing about him is that you can make deals with him which could be beneficial for both sides. 

What South Korea cannot do is depend on United States and expect that the US won't interfere with South Korean policies. And the US will demand more and more financially, that it will never end. There will be endless bickerings over who pays what. South Korea needs to stand up on its own and become a normal country with its own military controlled by its own nation.  

The US military leaving South Korea would be hard in the beginning, but it will also remove a whole load of headaches at the same time. For instance, North Korea cannot use the US military in Korea as an excuse to be so belligerent. China will also become far less patient with North Korea's belligerence. And there will be no reason for North Korea to threaten the US with nuclear annihilation. This will dial down the animosity in East Asia.  World accepting and recognizing the nuclear status for both North and South Korea's, this region will become safer. ","This is what I would do if I was Moon Jae-in 1.
