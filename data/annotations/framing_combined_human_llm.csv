However it doesn't seem like the case. Both US and China are suffering from trade war but I do believe China is suffering more. My Chinese stocks are going down and I sold them all. The problem is China is simply too reliant on foreign markets in order to function effectively.

&#x200B;

Despite the desire for free trade, it seems like the EU and Canada and Australia and being pro-US despite it not benefiting their economies. A good example is the Canadian ban on Huawei, it will help the Canadian tech industry a lot, the security of alliance with US trumps it. Australian politicians are growing more and more worried about China despite it being such a large partner with China.

If you have been watching comments by Steve Bannon, this is purely ideological not diplomatic. Men like Bannon hate the fact China is a command economy and rising. China is not a huge THREAT on American security, but a THREAT on the American identity *of what nation should be* and democracies from Japan to Germany are supporting America on this.

As you can see, the land route travels through Iran, Turkey, eastward to Moscow, and back over to the rest of Europe. This got me thinking: could the US purposefully be escalating tensions with Iran in order to kill the BRI?

The US has put sanctions on Iran. At this point, Iran is practically begging for sanction relief. The common consensus is that the US is putting sanctions on Iran in order to create dissatisfaction with the current regime among the Iranian people, possibly leading to a revolution that will install a more democratic and pro-US government. This would lead to Iran being less inclined to work with China. If the sanctions don't work, the US can always use its military to invade, but that would be a last resort.

If Iran is no longer willing to cooperate with China's ambitions, the only other option left for the BRI's land route would be to travel through Russia into Eastern Europe, where the US has much more influence than in Southeast Europe.
