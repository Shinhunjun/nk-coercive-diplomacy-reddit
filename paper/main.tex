    \answerTODO{Answer}
  \item Did you discuss competing hypotheses or theories that might challenge or complement your theoretical results?
    \answerTODO{Answer}
  \item Have you considered alternative mechanisms or explanations that might account for the same outcomes observed in your study?
    \answerTODO{Answer}
  \item Did you address potential biases or limitations in your theoretical framework?
    \answerTODO{Answer}
  \item Have you related your theoretical results to the existing literature in social science?
    \answerTODO{Answer}
  \item Did you discuss the implications of your theoretical results for policy, practice, or further research in the social science domain?
    \answerTODO{Answer}
\end{enumerate}

\item Additionally, if you are including theoretical proofs...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you state the full set of assumptions of all theoretical results?
    \answerTODO{Answer}
