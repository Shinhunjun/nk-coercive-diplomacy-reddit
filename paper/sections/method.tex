\section{Method}
\subsection{Data Collection}
We collected Reddit posts from January 2017 to June 2019 using the Arctic Shift API~\cite{arcticshift2024}, targeting eight major subreddits: r/worldnews, r/politics, r/news, r/geopolitics, r/korea, r/northkorea, r/AskAnAmerican, and r/NeutralPolitics. All posts were filtered to English using Reddit's language metadata. In total, we collected 29,688 posts across all groups: 10,448 posts for North Korea (treatment), 5,921 for China, 4,749 for Iran, and 8,570 for Russia (control groups).
% \mohit{Add more info. Say how much you collected, the total number of posts that were collected and the commenst etc. }
% \jun{Fixed: Added total post count (29,688), breakdown by group, and full subreddit list.}
% \mohit{Make them as textbf as subsubsections}
% \jun{Fixed: Changed to textbf inline headings.}

\textbf{Treatment and Control Groups.}
To isolate the causal impact of summit diplomacy, it is essential to control for concurrent geopolitical developments that could confound inference. Relying solely on longitudinal observations of the treatment group (North Korea) risks misinterpreting broader fluctuations in Reddit users' foreign policy sentiment as specific effects of the summits. 
% As noted in prior work~\cite{kumarswamy2025}, external ``offline'' events often drive significant spikes in online activity across all topics, necessitating a control group to distinguish treatment effects from general temporal trends.
% \mohit{I would recommend saying why we needed control group. Say that just making observations could lead to wrong results, hence we decided to have control groups, You have the text, you need to motivate it. Check Section 3 in my parler paper, where i motivate it, you just motivate it and then have the rest you have.}
% \jun{Fixed: Added motivation for why control groups are needed per Mohit's Parler paper Section 3.}

We selected control countries based on their exposure to concurrent high-stakes geopolitical developments, ensuring they were subject to similar levels of public scrutiny but not the specific summit diplomacy intervention. Specifically: (1) China was selected due to the ongoing U.S.--China trade war, which significantly shaped public opinion on Reddit during the study period; (2) Iran was included as a comparison case for nuclear diplomacy following the U.S. withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA); and (3) Russia was initially considered due to its prominence in U.S. political discourse amid the Mueller investigation into Russian election interference.
% \mohit{Add citations to these}
% \jun{Fixed: Added citations for China (Lai 2019), Iran (BBC 2018), Russia (Mueller 2019).}
% \mohit{Jun given that both the parallel Trends test results for sentiment and Framing are valid, how about we put the table in appendix and just say in the text here that all p values were valid and Tables 2 and 3 are in Appendix? Thoughts? This will free up space for us}
% \jun{Agreed! Moved tables to Appendix (Tables~\ref{tab:app_pt_sentiment} and~\ref{tab:app_pt_framing}). Note: Russia P1→P2 framing is now Invalid (p=0.01) with revised prompt.}
Using multiple controls allows us to assess robustness across different confounding structures. However, the validity of a DiD design rests on the parallel trends assumption: treated and control groups must exhibit similar trends in the outcome variable prior to the intervention. We verified this assumption for all groups (see Appendix Tables~\ref{tab:app_pt_sentiment} and~\ref{tab:app_pt_framing}). For sentiment, all three control groups satisfied parallel trends ($p > 0.05$ for all comparisons). For framing, China and Iran satisfied parallel trends, while Russia exhibited a significant violation for P1$\rightarrow$P2 ($p = 0.01$), likely reflecting differential political attention to Russia during the pre-treatment period. Consequently, we exclude Russia from framing analyses for the Singapore Summit effect and retain China and Iran as primary counterfactuals.
% \mohit{I would put the tables here so that it is easier for anyone to verify. A question might come why Russia was removed, even when the sentiment was valid, you should do more motivation and in the tables, rather than okay coloumn, change the name maybe based on Trends, and Valid and not Valid. Also, say here that if the value goes below 0.05, the results are voilated. so people know }
% \jun{Fixed: Moved tables here, changed OK column to Trends (Valid/Invalid).}

\textbf{Key Events and Analysis Periods:} To avoid anticipation effects, we define three analysis periods excluding transition months and Figure~\ref{fig:timeline} visually summarizes these periods and events:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{P1} (2017.01--2018.02): Pre-Announcement
    \item \textbf{P2} (2018.06--2019.01): Singapore-Hanoi
    \item \textbf{P3} (2019.03--2019.12): Post-Hanoi
    \item \textit{Excluded}: 2018.03--05, 2019.02 (Transition periods)
\end{itemize}
% Key diplomatic events include the Singapore Summit (2018-06-12), which marked peak diplomatic engagement, and the Hanoi Summit (2019-02-27), which ended without agreement.

\subsection{Outcome Measurement}
To answer our research questions, we measure two complementary dimensions of discourse: \textit{sentiment} (emotional valence) and \textit{framing} (how North Korea is narratively positioned). 
% \mohit{Say here to answer our Research questions} \jun{Fixed: Connected measurement to RQs.}

\textbf{Sentiment Analysis: } We compute sentiment using the TweetEval RoBERTa model~\cite{barbieri2020tweeteval}, a widely adopted benchmark for social media sentiment analysis. This model was trained on Twitter data, making it particularly suitable for analyzing informal, user-generated content on platforms like Reddit, which shares similar linguistic characteristics with Twitter posts. The model maps text to a continuous score from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive), capturing the \textit{emotional valence} of discourse. 
% \mohit{Here say why we choose this? Is this a very popular sentiment analysis, if yes, then cite the papers.} \jun{Fixed: Added justification for TweetEval choice.}

\textbf{Framing Classification: } We classify each Reddit post into one of five framing categories (THREAT, ECONOMIC, NEUTRAL, HUMANITARIAN, DIPLOMACY) using GPT-4o-mini (API version: July 2024, temperature = 0, seed = 42 for reproducibility) within a ``Codebook LLM'' framework, which treats the model as a clear-cut measurement instrument rather than a black box. The prompt provides category definitions and requires a single label output; the model also returns a confidence score.
% \mohit{I would recommend putting the prompt with detailed information in the Appendix}
% \jun{Fixed: Added full prompt details to Appendix B.}
Detailed prompt instructions and category definitions are provided in Appendix~\ref{app:llm_prompt}. To ensure classification quality, we retained only predictions with confidence $\geq 0.90$, yielding 27,863 posts (94\% of the original sample). For DiD analysis, we convert categorical framing to a continuous \textit{diplomacy scale}: THREAT = $-2$, DIPLOMACY = $+2$, and NEUTRAL/ECONOMIC/HUMANITARIAN = $0$. This scale captures the primary distinction between military threat framing and diplomatic engagement framing, allowing direct quantification of how discourse shifts between adversarial and cooperative orientations. While economic sanctions can function as coercive instruments in international relations, we treat ECONOMIC framing as neutral in our primary specification because our theoretical focus is on the rhetorical distinction between \textit{military threats} and \textit{diplomatic dialogue}---the two poles most directly affected by summit diplomacy. A robustness check treating ECONOMIC as partially coercive (ECONOMIC = $-1$) yields similar or stronger results, suggesting our main specification is conservative (see Appendix~\ref{app:robustness}). We aggregate individual post scores to monthly averages, yielding a continuous outcome variable for each country-month observation.

\textbf{Human Annotation Benchmark: } To validate our LLM-based classification in a domain-sensitive setting, we constructed a gold-standard human annotation benchmark. Two military officers with expertise in North Korean affairs independently labeled 500 stratified samples (4 countries $\times$ 3 periods $\times$ 5 frames). We provide detailed information in the Results section.
% The inter-coder reliability, measured by the Cohen's Kappa score ($\kappa$), was 0.75, indicating substantial agreement. LLM-human agreement achieved Cohen's $\kappa$ = 0.79 (substantial agreement) with 85.0\% accuracy, as detailed in the 
% We followed an iterative codebook refinement approach:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item \textbf{Pilot Round}: 100 posts labeled independently with reliability assessment
%     \item \textbf{Main Annotation}: Remaining posts labeled in batches with periodic checks
%     \item \textbf{Disagreement Resolution}: Structured discussion to produce consensus labels
% \end{enumerate} 
% \mohit{We dont need the codebook refinement approach. Blinded it }
% Inter-rater reliability (Cohen's $\kappa$) and LLM-human agreement metrics are reported in the Results section.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Causal Identification}
We estimate the causal impact of summit diplomacy using a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) design with North Korea as the treated group and control countries (China, Iran, Russia) as comparisons. 
We chose the DiD method over Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis because DiD is widely recognized in the econometrics and causal inference community for handling quasi-experimental interventions~\cite{berger2020tarp,yang2022effects}. Specifically, just as Kumarswamy et al.~\cite{kumarswamy2025} utilized a control platform (Twitter) to isolate Parler's policy effects from concurrent offline events (e.g., the Capitol riot), we leverage multiple control countries to separate the effects of U.S.-North Korea summits from confounding global geopolitical developments.
By using China, Iran, and Russia as counterfactuals, we control for external shocks such as the U.S.-China trade war, JCPOA withdrawal tensions, and the Mueller investigation, respectively. This design ensures that observed changes in North Korea discourse are attributable to summit diplomacy rather than general fluctuations in foreign policy attention or sentiment.

\textbf{Difference-in-Differences Specification:} Our main specification uses two-way fixed effects:
\begin{equation}
Y_{g,t} = \alpha_g + \gamma_t + \beta \big(\text{Treat}_g \times \text{Post}_t\big) + \epsilon_{g,t},
\end{equation}
where $Y_{g,t}$ is the monthly average sentiment (or framing) for group $g$ in month $t$, 
$\alpha_g$ and $\gamma_t$ denote group and month fixed effects, and $\beta$ captures the DID estimate of the summit effect. We report heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors clustered at the group level. We explicitly verified the parallel trends assumption, as detailed in the Data Collection subsection above.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Network Structure Analysis}
Beyond content-level changes, we examine whether diplomatic events reorganize the \textit{structure} of discourse. We adopt a \textbf{GraphRAG-inspired indexing pipeline}~\cite{edge2024graphrag}, leveraging its entity and relationship extraction capabilities to construct structured knowledge graphs. Recent advances have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can effectively extract structured knowledge from unstructured text across complex domains, often outperforming traditional information extraction methods~\cite{Anuyah2025CoDeKG,Yang2025SepsisKG}. This approach has proven particularly valuable for analyzing political discourse, where LLMs can identify key actors, events, and their relationships from noisy media content~\cite{Arslan2024PoliticalRAG,Fadda2025LLM_KG_Viewpoints}. While GraphRAG is primarily designed for retrieval-augmented generation, we utilize only its initial \textbf{indexing phase} (which extracts entities and relationships via LLM to build a structured knowledge graph) as a scalable, automated method for constructing the inputs needed for Discourse Network Analysis (DNA)~\cite{leifeld2016policy}. This methodology aligns with recent frameworks that use LLM-constructed graphs to capture complex multi-level relationships and unification of fragmented evidence~\cite{Feng2025BioRAG,Ling2026LLM_KG_Review}.
% \jun{Fixed: Added motivation for GraphRAG with newer papers (2024-2026) on LLM-based KG construction.}
Unlike simple keyword co-occurrence networks, which cannot distinguish whether two entities co-occur in a ``threat'' or ``negotiation'' context, this approach extracts semantically meaningful relationships, enabling analysis of \textit{narrative connectivity} rather than mere lexical proximity. We utilize this pipeline to generate knowledge graphs from Reddit discussions for each analysis period.

\textbf{Graph Construction and Customization: }We customized the graph extraction prompts to capture domain-specific constraints. We extended the default entity taxonomy to include \textbf{WEAPON} (e.g., ``ICBM,'' ``nuclear warhead'') and \textbf{POLICY} (e.g., ``denuclearization,'' ``maximum pressure'') categories, ensuring the retrieval of security-relevant concepts central to North Korea discourse.

\textbf{Hierarchical Frame Classification: }To ensure methodological consistency between content and structural analyses, we applied the same ``Codebook LLM'' classifier (GPT-4o-mini) used for individual posts to the structural outputs of the graph-based indexing pipeline:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Edge Classification}: We classified the extracted relationship descriptions between entities to determine if the structural link represented a ``Threat,'' ``Diplomacy,'' or other connection type.
    \item \textbf{Community Classification}: We classified the generated summaries of each community to identify the dominant narrative orientation of that cluster.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Network Metrics: } We compute three key structural metrics to test for discourse reorganization:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Network Density}: Measures structural consolidation and discourse cohesion (testing for fragmentation vs. unification).
    \item \textbf{Edge Framing Distribution}: Quantifies the proportion of adversarial vs. diplomatic relationships, providing a structural test of the ``ratchet effect.''
    \item \textbf{Community Composition}: Identifies thematic diversification by tracking the emergence of non-security clusters (e.g., humanitarian, economic) in the community structure.
\end{enumerate}
This structural analysis tests whether content-level framing shifts are accompanied by reorganization of discourse networks.
