% Abstract
High-stakes diplomatic summits can dramatically shift public perception of foreign adversaries, yet the causal mechanisms underlying these shifts remain poorly understood in online discourse. This study examines how the 2018 Singapore Summit and the 2019 Hanoi Summit failure affected public opinion framing of North Korea on Reddit. Using a novel combination of LLM-based framing classification validated by domain experts (military officers) and a Difference-in-Differences design with multiple control countries (China, Iran, Russia), we analyze over 35,000 Reddit posts from 2017-2019. 

Our findings reveal that the Singapore Summit produced a significant positive shift in both sentiment (+0.10 to +0.21) and framing (+0.85 to +1.28) toward diplomatic frames, while the failed Hanoi Summit triggered a partial reversal (-0.06 to -0.12 in sentiment, -0.30 to -0.88 in framing). Notably, the positive gains from successful diplomacy were not fully erased by the diplomatic failure, suggesting a ``ratchet effect'' in public opinion formation.

This work contributes to understanding the ``rally-round-the-flag'' effect in digital spaces and demonstrates a rigorous methodology for causal inference in computational social science.
