\section{Conclusion}

This study provides causal evidence of how high-stakes diplomatic summits affect public opinion framing on social media. Using a Difference-in-Differences design with validated LLM-based classification, we find that:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The 2018 Singapore Summit produced significant positive shifts in both sentiment and framing toward North Korea
    \item The 2019 Hanoi Summit failure triggered partial reversals, but did not fully undo the positive gains
    \item This ``ratchet effect'' suggests that successful diplomacy can create durable changes in public discourse
\end{enumerate}

Our methodology---combining LLM classification with expert validation and rigorous causal inference---provides a template for studying public opinion dynamics around international events. Future work should extend this analysis to other diplomatic contexts and examine the mechanisms underlying opinion persistence.
