\subsection{Rally-Round-the-Flag Effect}

The rally-round-the-flag effect describes the phenomenon where public approval of national leaders increases during international crises or major foreign policy events \cite{mueller1970}. While extensively studied in traditional polling contexts, its manifestation in social media discourse remains underexplored.

\subsection{Media Framing}

Framing theory posits that how information is presented significantly influences audience interpretation \cite{entman1993}. In international relations coverage, common frames include threat, diplomacy, economic, and humanitarian perspectives \cite{iyengar1991}.

\subsection{Social Media and Public Opinion}

Reddit, as a major discussion platform, has been increasingly used to study public opinion dynamics \cite{baumgartner2020}. Unlike Twitter, Reddit's structure enables longer-form discussion and topical organization through subreddits.

\subsection{LLMs for Content Analysis}

Recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of large language models for text classification tasks previously requiring human annotation \cite{gilardi2023}. However, validation against domain experts remains critical for specialized content.
