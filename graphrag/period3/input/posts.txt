TITLE: Can someone tell me why people think North Korea is harmless?

POST: I really don't know why people think North Korea is so harmless and won't do anything at all when they have the U.S(Among other) breathing down their necks.  


They can practically destroy a city(seoul) as one can stomp on a cockroach.  


I am reaching the end of my rope with them and I practically give up with trying to understand them.  


But,I just want to know why people see North Korea as some harmless puppy.

COMMENTS:
The word should be "relatively" harmless.

\> They can practically destroy a city(seoul) as one can stomp on a cockroach.

So can any nuclear country. US for instance can stomp any non-nuclear country into the ground, (and have a history of doing so), yet not too many people who probably visit this forum will tell you that the US is a menace to humanity.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Capacity is not the only measurement for harm. People draw their conclusions about NK though a variety of other factors as well, and some may very well conclude that though their analysis on NK's strategic outlook, that is is not in the interest of NK to take aggressive actions.

I happen to be in that camp, and as far as I can tell, it should be plainly obvious to the NK leadership, that major acts of aggression will not bring them any benefits. And that this situation is also unlikely to change anytime soon.

Well they are not the Soviet Union or China now who pose a threat to US hegemony. They are not even Saddam Hussein who could pose a threat to world oil supplies. They are a small hermit kingdom with a large but obsolete military with nuclear weapons.

North Korea doesn't attack simply because they are detered by the United States who could destroy them with ease. The US would not attack North Korea because they are not a threat and its not worth Japan and South Korea getting nuked. Kim needs a nuke that could hit the US to deter any possible American change in policy(lets say if US is take over by a crazy president and wants regime change in North Korea), so an ICBM would be able to strike and destroy a large part of the US. However, Kim isn't just going to nuke the United States out of the blue, the nukes are there as deterence just like the Soviets used them in case their government is destroyed by the United States so they have a means of retaliation. However unlike the Soviets, North Korea is a weak nation, they can't really expand into Asia and overtake the US economy. They could try attacking South Korea, but the US forces are there and would easily beat them.

So why does US fear an ICBM armerd North Korea? Well it means that the US could no longer attempt topple Kim without the possibly of L.A getting destroyed. If the North did attack South Korea it means the US will have no way to move into North Korea without getting nuked, the US would have to beat back North Korea but cannot go into North Korea and take out Kim without getting nuked. They would have push NK forces to the DMZ, but no regime change. This makes an invasion of South Korea all more tempting. Because of this, South Korea likely will be much more keen on developing its own nuclear weapons resulting in nuclear proliferation, and heighten tensions on the Korean proliferation to prevent first strikes.

They’re 98% talk. North Korea making any moves towards an attack would result in north and South Korea being obliterated 100% it’s counter productive for them to make any kind of move

> 1-N.Korea will NEVER get rid of the one thing that keeps it from being invaded and ending up like the likes of Iraq and Libya.

What makes the situation so dangerous is that NK and the US have irreconcilable goals. NK wants a nuclear weapon for protection. The US feels NK cannot be trusted to have a nuclear weapon, and will destroy the regime rather than let that happen. One of these countries has to give, so never say never.

> 2-China is still in N.Korea's corner(and to a lesser extent,Russia) Unless you can get China to take N.Korea's denuclearization seriously(by helping in some matter) then Denuclearization is a Non-starter at this point. 

A lot of analysts think NK's current nuclear 'stage' is ideal for China. China doesn't actually want a nuclear armed Japan or SK (as response to a nuclear NK), but they like using the threat of a nuclear NK as leverage against the US. So China may in fact aid the US if NK ever goes full nuclear.

> And given that they have nukes anyway,why exactly are we sanctioning N.Korea again? The sanctions clearly have no effect and all it does is make us look stupid in the eyes of the world(IMO)...just what on earth is there LEFT to sanction when it comes to N.Korea? 

Nuclear weapons are illegal; the international community doesn't want nuclear proliferation and can't just turn a blind eye to it.

> 4-N.Korea is not gonna invade anyone anytime soon,and if they do...Let's just say it'll hell mixed with WWIII.

NK and SK are still formally at war, for the record.

> And N.Korea is all about regime survival,right? Like hell they'd do anything to get themselves obliterated(although,truth be told,they can do some obliterating of their own.) 

As it stands, unless the US is bluffing, they're on a trajectory of being obliterated. Sometimes miscalculations happen.

> 5-WHY are we so concerned about their nukes when again China and Russia have more and are far more of a threat to the world than N.Korea could ever be? If our administration is so willing to commit to this stupid nonsense,why don't we ask China and Russia to denuclearize? Oh wait,THAT'LL NEVER HAPPEN.

Exactly. But also, China and Russia have shown a degree of responsibility towards their nuclear arsenal and welfare of their people that NK hasn't, adding to their credibility.

> -All in all,N.Korea is like a wild animal..a wild animal with a dragon in it's corner(China) and maybe a Bear(Russia) 

NK is generally considered a rational actor.

> We really need to just say we...well fucked up with North Korea and sign a non-aggression pact with them or something..or just destroy them like certain people(Bolton most of all) in this administration want. 

"We" as in the US? SK and NK currently have an armistice, which is tantamount to the US and NK having one. 

The US can't just "destroy" NK for a variety of factors, including NK's ability to destroy Seoul.

> Especially in light of what we we did with the Iran nuclear deal...why should ANYONE have any reason to trust the U.S? Least of all,N.Korea? 

Very true.

> If we could live with a Soviet Union that had more nukes than God(So to speak) and a nuclear China(and India and Pakistan) why in the hell can't we live with a Nuclear N.Korea?

The qualitative difference here is that NK has a level of hostility towards the US, SK, and Japan that is not only intolerable to the US, but threatening to the greater region. Enough where even the international community doesn't want NK to have nukes.

That said, the US may well allow NK to have nukes if it deems a military strike unwise, for political or strategic reasons. But right now the US simply doesn't want NK to have that potential, and will likely use physical force to prevent it from happening.

There's undeniably neglect, exploitation, and persecution but it's important to bear in mind that it took Western democracies nearly 90 years to transition into something resembling our current standard of living during industrialization.

That required dozens if not hundreds of massacres of unarmed protestors, legal challenges, and political reform.  While the CCP has certainly not relinquished much power, it's created a solid middle class of some 300 million that is literally the entire population of the United States with a class in extreme poverty and unemployment somewhere around 100 million.  

That's a staggering number until we remember that's 10% of the population and the vast majority of the population was considered impoverished just 40 years ago.

TITLE: Trump Undercuts John Bolton on North Korea and Iran

COMMENTS:
Bolton acts as the bad cop while Trump gets away with being the relative good cop; you know, the "at least he's not as bad as the other guy" mentality. it's apparently somewhat effective since i've seen plenty of people who've been adamantly anti-Trump since 2016 give him credit for "cracking down" on Bolton's warmongering. 

plus, having some of the warhawk elements of the rightwing give their support to Bolton and in turn Trump's administration isn't so bad either. between Bolton's obnoxious war fever and Trump's ambiguous comments about Iran and Venezuela i'd imagine they're feeling fairly empowered right about now.
---
If John Bolton is such a warmonger and Trump opposes an armed conflict, then why hasn't Bolton been fired?
---
President Trump publicly undercut John R. Bolton, his national security adviser, on Iran and North Korea in recent days, raising questions about the administration’s policy and personnel in the middle of confrontations with both long-term American adversaries.

During a four-day visit to Japan that ended Tuesday, Trump contradicted Bolton by saying that recent North Korean missile tests did not violate United Nations restrictions.

“If it was up to John, we’d be in four wars now,” one senior official has recounted Mr. Trump as saying in private.

---DOCUMENT_SEPARATOR---

TITLE: Is Trump's dismissal of worry over North Korea's continued missile activities basically correct?

POST: Trump seems to be suggesting that the Koreans are simply posturing.  Isn't that right, and don't we see this all the time?

The U.S. has been posturing in the Middle East big time for weeks now to threaten Iran.   The Russians recently flew planes near our northern borders--again, for about the umpteenth time.  The Chinese will likely provoke some new issue in the South China sea soon, prompting more U.S. ship movements in the area, amid rhetoric. 

Posturing is what nations do, especially semi-belligerent nations at odds with other semi-belligerent nations.  North Korea has nukes.  It has missiles.  What else is new?

Kim Jong-un is posturing to try to influence the sanctions on him.  Should we accept that for what it appears to be, or agree with John Bolton's more hardline views on North Korea.

COMMENTS:
This is a very typical US perspective. 

It's what Peter Zeihan says - the US is supremely secure to the point where it wages wars of convenience. So yes to the US it's all mere posturing, but not to the countries who are Ground Zero when words turn into fists. Take North Korea: For Japan, South Korea, and China, the stakes are very real because any attacks and any fighting will be on their borders if not their territory. For the US whose losses are really only limited to military assets (if that), it's a game.
---
The stopping power of water is huge.
---
is this an argument against Zihan's analysis? because the comment actually seems to support it (albeit with some moral objection perhaps).

because the US really *is* supremely secure both geographically and demographically. this doesn't make American geopolitics any more or less of a *game*. rule one of human group politics is still true: the strong do what they can and the weak endure what they must.

Trump's trade wars and attitude to foreign affairs is actually much more inline with the post cold war world than any of his predecessors policies.

in this regards Zihan appears to have been right all along despite being disliked by many - the US seems headed back to a sort of neo-isolationism and cares less and less for old allies and friend (e: or about the Bretton Woods post ww2 world order) - yet it's not a game - it's a result of geopolitical changes and most notably the absence of a hegemonic threat to the US. 

i would argue Zihan's thesis is the only one (that i am familiar with) that actually explains and even predicts this. he is likely wrong on many things - like the rise of 3d printing - but on the soviet collapse and shale revolution along with credit demographics making the US unique in the next half century - i think he is right on the money.
---
I would argue its not a major thing to be concerned about. The korean war never officially ended, and has been going on for ~70 years. Things like this have happened a number of times for various reasons throught that time. The increased posturing could be based on actions taken by the ROK forces and their allies (maybe ROK is moving more forces closer to the border, maybe a big training event is coming up, who knows). Or perhaps its in relation to the various talks of denuclearization Trump and Kim have had. They could also be gauging ROK/allied response to the weapons test as a way to measure the current overall situation.

The major concern is a significant change from NK. If NK begins moving any significant number of troops, for example, then thats a cause for concern.  Weapons development/testing is something to pay attention to, but its expected and largely benign. As their weapons improves the ROK and allied forces are also improving their own weapons and countermeasures. This doesn't neccessarily reduce the damage NK could inflict, especially on civilian populations like Seoul, but it removes the concern that theyll pull ahead of the ROK and allies.

As for John Bolton, its accepted he is overall supports the US going to war. Without knowing Bolton's exact views on NK, I can't comment on them much, but NK is a sensitive area. A war on the Korea peninsula would be bloody, would have an impact on certain international markets (Samsung, Hyundai, etc.), and we would almost certainly see China get involved, further complicating the situation both locally and internationally. I would argue US and ROK military leaders are more opposed to the war, and I feel that we should follow their opinions more closely than Bolton's.

1) the only people that really suffer because of them is North Koreans.

2) after 70 years can we dispense with the idea they're insane? The Kims want, above all, to remain the leaders of NK. They'll act crazy to get some wheat or fuel oil shipments or something. They probably aren't actually going to nuke somebody--- unless we invade them, of course.

So basically just contain them, give them some food from time to time, and move on with life. Don't really know what else you can do with them that isn't worse than being nonchalant. Any real attempt to end the regime would bring about all those negative consequences you're using to justify a real attempt to end the regime.
---
Is this a troll post? It is extraordinarily unlikely that North Korea will ever use nuclear weapons or attack Japan, the US, or South Korea. The reasons the world has had relations with them for decades, despite their nuclear weapons program, is that they are more integrated into the world system than is often portrayed by the Western media and, no country (SK and Japan included) views them as a threat worth invading over.

> Take the fear of invasion away and that cult of personality disappears

Yes. That is why it is imperative that America calms down first. Threats of invasion (Libya option?) and sanctions leading to real civilian deaths give Kim all the ammo he needs to maintain his rule indefintely.

Kim, as a major power broker, is here to stay. Just like Trump or Putin. The plan would be to work around him. 

Right now, Kim is getting a very large slice of the North Korea pie. But the whole pie is tiny. If he opens up the country, China/SK/America can offer him a smaller slice, but from a MUCH larger pie. And then, the people of NK will have more as well.
---
China doesn’t even have bases in NK. Or supplied hardware in the last 30 years+.

If that warrants being designated a “protectorate”, then Saudi Arabia and Israel are without a shred of a doubt protectorates of America, and the Trump regime should be held responsible for their actions. Do you agree with that statement? 

Is the country starving because China sanctioned them? Did they develop nukes because China threatened to invade them? Did China attempt to sabotage peace talks between them and SK? So you tell me who is behind this mess, and who should clean it up.

The only viable solution is to not touch, nor threaten NK, and let them talk with SK without interference, as sovereign nations are entitled to. Peace is built by interconnection. Through connection with it’s neighbors, NK will no longer have incentives to adopt an aggressive posture. 

The priority should be to get them to open up their borders first, then get them to open up their economy for investment.
---
I feel like the costs involved in the long game strategy are worth it compared to the shorter term invasion or coup strategy. After all, NK has nukes they could use and even its conventional capabilities, the terrain and highly militarised society would make a conflict a bloodbath for South Korea and probably inflict quite significant US casualties too. Japan might also see deaths. 


I think also that, since the collapse of the USSR in the 90s, the NK situation has broadly improved, at least economically. Socially, not so sure. Obviously, it's still a totalitarian society.

Chemistry is chemistry no matter where you learn it.  

>but because North Korea is so sanctioned and so isolated they don't have the experience, resources or means to become a third tier power let alone a second tier power. 

But they do though, those sanctions and isolation made them self-sufficient to a degree unlike any other modern country.   I have no doubt their history classes are entirely biased, but the necessity of developing their own industries for _everything_ means they have specialists in just about every discipline.   They have to develop their own cellphone technology, their own computing technologies, their own material production technologies, etc...

And you can learn how to make rubber or steel on the internet, these aren't secret disciplines.  But since north korea can't buy that stuff from anyone else they had to train their own engineers and scientists to make rubber and steel and plastic and everything else they needed to build their society.

They are a smart country overall and hugely underestimated.

The report said: "In the past, these specialized rail cars appear to have been associated with the movement of radioactive material or reprocessing campaigns.... The current activity, along with their configurations, does not rule out their possible involvement in such activity, either before or after a reprocessing campaign."

TITLE: I don't understand North Korea at all.

COMMENTS:
This seems to be a rather remarkably odd question given this forum is filled with people with some background knowledge. First, the North Korean regime is not mad nor crazy. They are perfectly rational and they calculate every single move they make. Their ultimate goal is regime survival and that depends on their retention of nuclear weapons. If history has proven anything, no nuclear country has been invaded so far. Therefore, they believe that nuclear weapons are the ultimate guarantee of their sovereignty and their existence. To put this into perspective, NK started to develop their nuclear program when they economy was surpassed by South Korea. Until the 60's and 70's both Koreas were on par, or NK was slightly ahead of South Korea. That was one of the reasons why Park Chung-hee, then president of South Korea, tried to develop an arsenal of his own (But he had to back down after heavy American pressure). However, from the 80's South Korea's economy (and its military budget) far surpassed North Korea and since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the gap has widened immensely. Now, South Korea's economy is nearly 50 times larger than North Korea and the military budget of South Korea far outstrips the entire economy of NK. In the past (like some 40 years ago?), North Korea could claim legitimacy for representing the whole of the Korean nation, promoting their credentials as independence fighters and a stronger economy. But now they are poor, irrelevant, brutal, isolated and oppressed. In contrast, South Korea is now a full-fledged democracy, liberal and prosperous, a respected member of the international community which does not need to promote legitimacy of any sort, because it already is ***THE BEST KOREA***. In this context, North Korea has to become more repressive domestically (to prevent domestic unrest), and has to have a guarantee to prevent external aggression given the ***HUGE/OVERWHELMING*** disparity of power between her neighbor in the South. So that is its rationale, and there is no endgame. They want to survive and retain its regime in the current form. Do they want to unify the whole of Korea? Definitely not. South Korea is a huge lot they cannot chew nor digest. Their only chances of making a significant blow to South Korea, militarily speaking, is by using Nukes, but if the do so, their country would be erased from the map. Their artillery can afflict damage to metropolitan Seoul, but they would be wasting their shells (because they don't have enough spare ammo to target military bases), and the counter-attack would be massive and their entire army would be obliterated within 48 hours.

TITLE: The case for a small-deal approach towards North Korea

POST: The last Hanoi summit ended in a debacle, with neither side gaining anything from the other. Nevertheless, contrary to expectations, the relationship between president Trump and chairman Kim remained cordial. Under normal circumstances, we would have expected fire and fury and threats of nuclear armaggedon all over again, but both decided to remain calm and leave at least some breathing space for more negotiations. Of course, Team Trump is still resolute on having a "BIG DEAL" and Team Kim is adamant about giving up all its nuclear arsenal. So the gap is still wide and it is hard to reach a settlement, for now. In order to break the stalemate and move foward, a small-deal, however small it may be, must be reached to begin a "process" which will finally deliver a functioning modus vivendi for the peninsula and the parties involved. 

The reason are as follows:

(1) ***The current stalemate cannot last forever, time will eventually run out and the US will not be able to respond.*** Kim Jong-un will feel compelled to renew his provocations if he feels humiliated (or if he feels pressured to act) and the US will feel compelled to retaliate if such thing were to happen. However, this time, the US will not have the support of key players in the region, such as China or Russia, and more importantly South Korea. Fire and fury threats worked once, but it cannot work twice. Back then, China and Russia were compliant to US demands, and the UN passed resolutions which put maximum pressure in place. But since it has become apparent that Team Trump is not the Mad-man it pretended to be, China and Russia will not be willing to cooperate with the US. Moreover, given the increasing tensions between the US/China and US/Russia, there is little reason for either country to do something in favor of the US. Actually, they are already violating the sanctions they themselves have agreed upon, and that is completely understandable from the view of Realpolitik. 

(2)***A complete breakdown of negotiations between the US and NK is *REALLY* dangerous.*** The recent overtures from NK as well as the US for more cordiality and dialogue is unprecedented and has increased expectations to an astonishing degree. But when you fall from high, you get hit harder. In this case, the US will not be affected very much from negotiations being torn apart, but KJU will certainly be. His reputation within the regime will be hurt, and he will be encircled by hardliners. Even dictators or kings of a dynasty cannot act freely and they are prisoners of their own regime, having limited scope of action. The working logic of the regime demands that he has to show action should negotiations fail. That by itself is a danger for the Korean peninsula. Even if KJU may be reluctant to take offensive action, he has to do something to perserve his prestige and legitimacy within the regime, and that may incite a vicious cycle of tit for tat which may end in a catastrophe. 

(3) ***The US cannot handle tensions in all fronts at the same time.*** the US has alienated most of the world already, in a feat of bravado or sheer stupidity. US-China, US-EU, US-Russia, US-Iran, and the list goes on and on. It is time to make more friends and less enemies. However, the US is creating more enemies in an unprecedented pace, and the relative position of the US vis-a-vis the world is weaker than ever before. Today is not like the heydays of post-WW2 world, when the US controlled over 50 percent of the global GDP. The US cannot make the world in its image or control the outcome of every political incident in the world. The same holds true for the North Korean crisis, and the US should better accommodate a little in order to maintain stability in the region. 

(4) ***North Korea is not an existential threat to the US nor South Korea.*** North Korea's entire annual budget is less than a provincial city of South Korea. Its army, though impressive on paper, is but a decrepit corpse which relies on theft and pillage to survive, no better than the Red army during the early days of the Soviet revolution. They are more like a bandits and cossacks rather than a regular professional army. The only real capability which poses a threat to South Korea and its allies are its WMDs, and they know that they will be annihilated if they use them. But if they are put in an extreme position, that of a dead-end, they may attempt a suicide attack. Of course, such a scenario can be prevented if we give them an alternative and a breathing space, for their ultimate goal is survival as any other state. 

(5) ***A small deal, however small it may be, is conducive to peace and stability.*** North Korea may cheat and may retain a fraction of its nuclear capabiltiies, but it is better to have them under international inspections rather than no inspection at all (And they have agreed to an international inspection). It is better to dismantle Yongbyeon than not closing them at all. A small deal, just small enough to save face for NK and the US will mark not an end of negotiations but the start of a process which will enable more regular contacts and that will create a modus vivendi for the parties involved. Step by step, NK will get what they want, and the US/SK will get what they want, thus creating a cycle for mutually beneficial deals. 

(6) ***Strategically speaking, it is also in the American interest to engage productively with North Korea, because otherwise they will feel compelled to align completely with China and Russia***, thus creating again the old cold war blocs. And this is already happening, just after the Hanoi debacle. North Korea must not become a Chinese or Russian lackey and they should remain a buffer, as they have always been, and preferably they should be under our influence, rather than Chinese or Russian.

>But when you fall from high, you get hit harder. In this case, the US will not be affected very much from negotiations being torn apart, but KJU will certainly be. His reputation within the regime will be hurt, and he will be encircled by hardliners. 

Kim Jong-un seems to be a pretty popular leader in the DPRK, economic growth in 2016 reached pre-1991 levels for the first time and the living standard has been increasing both in the city and the countryside. Kim Jong-un switched from the *songun* policy of his father (military first), to the *byungjin* policy inspired by his grandfather Kim il-Sung (focus on economic development). The nuclear program was completed under Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-un is probably more entrenched at this point in legitimacy than even his father Kim Jong-il, who largely drew his legitimacy by being groomed from Kim il-Sung, but life under him wasn't good. There was famine, the economic planning and distribution system practically collapsed, and everything that was left was thrown at the military to prevent collapse. 

When Kim Jong-un came of power, North Koreans seem to have been sceptical, reports are that he was nicknamed "the kid" in secret, but he has shown impressive resolve. He removed critical officials from power, retained the loyal, experienced ones, but also introduced a new, younger generation. I highly doubt that a failure in diplomacy with the US will have any impact. The North Korean narrative has never stopped portraying the US as the imperialist evil, if negotioans fail it can be blamed on the US and the nuclear program can be continued - this already happened after the deal with Clinton in 1998, after the US failed to deliver on the oil they promised and called them the "Axis of Evil" under Bush. From their perspective, and many other states, the DPRK hasn't done anything wrong: The US is the aggressor with the crippling economic sanctions, troops in North Korea, and smashing the democratically legitimized Korean People's Republic by installing Syngman Rhee as a South Korean dictator after World War II.

>Its army, though impressive on paper, is but a decrepit corpse which relies on theft and pillage to survive, no better than the Red army during the early days of the Soviet revolution.

And yet the Red Army crushed the better equipped White Army that also got foreign support and pushed the Poles back to Warsaw. But anyway, while their material is probably a bit aged, I wouldn't underestimate them like that. Their entire army has been preparing for an invasion since the Korean War. The country is hilly, and the soldiers are loyal. The entire hinterland of the DMZ is filled with obstacles for tanks and other vehicles, and dotted with bunkers. An invasion would be a very costly one for everyone who'd try. It's also a myth that they haven't updated any piece of equipment since the Cold War - they did update some stuff, especially in the department of tactical equipment and rifles. Also, don't forget that they have their entire artillery pointed at Seoul which is easily in shelling range for North Koreans.

>But if they are put in an extreme position, that of a dead-end, they may attempt a suicide attack.

I highly doubt it. They aren't cultish madmen. In fact, they've been acting more rational than the US.

Kim Jong-un will always face challenges to his legitimacy because his mother was the mistress, and he was not the oldest son. It does not matter what he does and what he can achieve. That is why it is of highest priority for KJU to kill his older brother, and all the offspring. Most North Koreans are rather conservative and this issue is a big deal. The thing with North Korea is we know very little about what is really going on among the leaders especially among military leaders.

On one hand I don't think the small deal strategy proposed by OP would work, because KJU can back out of it after the initial phrases had progressed well. On the other hand I can't imagine an al-la-carte sudden solution is feasible. It looks like South Korea/North Korea will inevitably get closer and that puts some pressure on US. So the two sides eventually meet in the middle some way.

TITLE: North Korea:Why do we even try?

COMMENTS:
North Korea will never denuclearize and Kim Jong Un would be a moron if he would approve denuclearization. Everyone who doesn't understand why I think so, just look at Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein and in the near future Iran. Each of those countries wanted nuclear weapons at some stage but were stopped by the USA in their endeavour.

North Korea succeeded and how you can see Kim Jong Un is still in power compared to the late Gaddafi and Saddam. Nuclear weapons will secure the power of the Kim family till the population decide that they had enough and revolt. But seeing the current developments the North Korean people seem to still approve of Kim Jong Un.
---
How do you propose we forget about NK, a country armed to the teeth, with nukes, within two hours flight distance to Seoul, Beijing, Tokyo - probably three of the world's top 5 economically productive cities - and who has a history of ambitious foreign policy goals and provoking neighbors?

This post, if picturized, would show an ostrich sticking its head in the sand. You can't forget about the world around you, no matter how hard you try.

Negotiation is important even if chances of success is low. It gives a peaceable venue for NK and the rest of the world to spar. And even if denuclearization is unlikely, meaningful changes in how NK interacts and behaves will lead to significant changes in geopolitical and socioeconomic situations, such that East Asian security is likely to improve.

They have to make a big deal out of it to scare other countries for trying to do the same. If superpowers don't care, you'll see everybody trying to get his own bombs.
It doesn't cost them much either, just a bit of communication. And the good thing with north korea id that you can scream at it as much as you want and they have no leverage to tell you to move on. Unlike other countries who would start getting annoyed if you kept screaming "denuclearize" at them and let it alter your trades.

TITLE: Does South Korea have the strongest "soft power" in Asia? Why are they so successful?

POST: A decade ago I would have said Japan had the strongest soft power in Asia,  but these days it seems Korea has eclipsed them. Aside from KPop and the massive popularity of BTS, Kdramas are massively increasing in popularity, Korean beauty products, their films.  And there there is Samsung and Hyundai. So many young teens want to learn Korean. It seems they are the most popular and liked Asian country in the west. Why are they so successful at soft power?

COMMENTS:
Very strong government support. There's literally a government department in charge of K-pop in the Ministry of Culture. Chang-dong district is basically the product of top down initial state planning and then letting the private sector take over much like Shenzhen. I don't think Japan has such government programs, at least nowhere nearly as strong. If it was China doing it, you can bet that the entire Western world would be constantly saying that it's government sponsored propaganda. For some context, there's a Hanfu revival movement within China that's pretty much started from the bottom up but there's still accusations of it being a government funded push to increase nationalism. I've watch a video that said that the Thai government also funds Thai restaurants and small eateries around the world to push Thai soft power through food but I think that pop culture branches out to everything including food, so the Korean strategy seems to be superior. 

https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/04/13/399414351/how-the-south-korean-government-made-k-pop-a-thing

>In the late '90s, when Asia went through a huge financial crisis, South Korea's leaders decided to use music to improve its image and build its cultural influence. So the country's government poured millions of dollars into forming a Ministry of Culture with a specific department devoted to K-pop.

>"It turns out that the Korean government treats its K-pop industry the way that the American government treats its automobile and banking industry, meaning that these are industries that have to be protected," Hong says.

>This included doing things like building massive, multi-million dollar concert auditoriums, refining hologram technology, and even helping regulate noeraebangs — karaoke bars — to protect the interests of K-pop stars.

>"They wanted Korea of the 21st century to be like America of the 20th century where America was just considered so universally cool that anything made in America would automatically be bought."


https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/How-government-backing-put-K-pop-on-the-map

>The government has also lent a hand, with a policy of promoting entertainment and other cultural exports. Since the 1998 currency crisis, each president has pitched in. Kim Dae-jung called himself a "cultural president," Roh Moo-hyun vowed to make South Korea one of the top five nations in the entertainment industry, and Lee Myung-bak set up a national branding committee.

>In 1999, South Korea increased its entertainment-related budget sixfold in a year. In setting up the Korea Creative Content Agency, or Kocca, the nation created a joint public-private effort to pitch South Korean entertainment to the rest of Asia. The result? A boom in the popularity of South Korean TV dramas and the emergence of the "Korean wave."

>In 2012, 279.8 billion won ($253 million at the current rate) of the national budget was allocated to the cultural-content industry and 118.8 billion won to the media industry, reportedly about eight times Japan's allocations.



>The success of K-pop does not happen by accident. It is a product of the South Korean government’s effective implementation of macroeconomic growth theory which focuses on developing three key elements – physical capital, human capital and technology – to achieve maximum growth in its music industry.

https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/12/k-popnomics-how-indonesia-and-other-nations-can-learn-from-korean-pop-music-industry/

>Following the 1998 Asian financial crisis, the government decided to use music to improve the nation’s image and build its cultural influence. The government poured millions of dollars into establishing a ministry of culture with a specific department devoted to K-pop.

>An entire district in Seoul, the Chang-dong district, was developed to become the hub for K-pop. Concert halls, recording studios, restaurants and retail stores were built there to support K-pop’s growth. The Seoul arena, also located in the district, is due for completion in 2020. It will be the country’s biggest performance hall with a 20,000 seating capacity.

>In fostering human capital, three major recording labels – SM, YG and JYP Entertainment – have been in the forefront in developing K-pop idols. Talents are placed into a rigorous training program for several years before their debuts. The training not only covers singing and dancing, but also lessons in foreign languages and public speaking.

They managed to successfully combine Western culture with Eastern culture to create products and media which is appealing to both demographics.

Out of the big three in East Asia (China, Japan and S.Korea), I would say Korea is by far the most westernised; I’m not saying that this is good or bad, but it definitely helped in promoting their country/culture effectively to the Western world.
---
As a South Korean, I'm not sure whether South Korea has the strongest soft power or not but if South Korea is definite no.1 in soft power, the reasons are as following;

* Strong Economical power

South Korean has the fourth largest GDP in Asia, following China, Japan and India. Also, average real wage and quality of life in South Korea are one of the highest in Asia. South Korea is not the country like Japan and Italy which have been suffered from terrible economical situation. These factors have made the potential of economical and cultural influence, and this potential started to realize after the begins of 21th century.

* Relatively democratic/liberal culture with peculiar non-Western culture

Of course there are several problems in South Korea when it comes to democracy (weak party politics/imperial presidency) and cultural liberalism (strict hierarchy system and patriarchal social culture) . However, it is undeniable fact that South Korea is one of the most democratic and liberal countries in Asia with Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong. These two would work as a basic premise to make cultural/soft-power revival. (it is one of the reason why China has relatively week soft power)

Moreover, despite of Westernization, South Korea has the definitely different culture from Western - peculiar food, language, value system, etc. It made its original soft power without harming democracy and liberalism too much.

* The decline of Japan

Japanese real wage is stagnated for almost 30 years without the sign of increase, despite economical boosting from Abenomics. It made Japanese power relatively weak, and it made the opportunity for South Korea to fill out the shrank influence of Japan.
---
In terms of worldwide, Japan has unparalleled soft power as far as Asian countries are concerned because of anime, video games, movies, media franchises etc. 

As for East and Southeast Asia, SK dominates, but Japan is just as big in SEA


In South Asia and the Middle East, Bollywood is forming as a soft power, way more so than Kpop or Korean dramas. Many Bollywood songs now have official Arabic versions.
---
For what it's worth, I think Japan has had a similar government push to promote cultural exports via "Cool Japan" which started about 2013, right after many of the dates referenced in your post.

TITLE: Should South Korea make formal triangular alliance with Japan and US?

POST: As a South Korean, I heard that proposal several times from anti-China/North Korea and pro-Japan/USA Internet users, editorials and scholars. It makes sense because South Korea has an already good alliance with USA, needs more better relationship with Japan, and have to make against Chinese power proliferation. However, this proposal could be considered more because it is hard to make genuine relationship with Japan, regarding historical anti-Japan sentiment in South Korea. Also, I heard that this trial make China, Russia and North Korea provoked to form more explicit NK-China-Russia alliance against SK-Japan-US alliance. What do you think of this triangular alliance proposal?

COMMENTS:
I found this post from a few months back to be really insightful in terms of Korea's political strategy when it comes to China. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/aa5ksr/a_geopolitical_strategy_for_south_korea/ecsfee1/

History has shown that allying explicitly against China has often led to disaster for Korea. Not to mention the economic considerations. China is by far South Korea's biggest customer, with exports to China being much greater than exports to Japan and the United States combined.
---
I can see why people make this proposal because they all share the same ideology. But in geopolitical terms it makes less sense. From a trilateral standpoint South Korea has the most to lose least to gain from partnering with japan and US. Their biggest trade partner is China and if they went to war, South Korea would be the first to take the brunt of the burden having the highest casualties and losing a lot from infrastructure. Their economy would be devastated being unable to export. 

However, I don’t see them formally aligning with China either due to different ideologies. 

Rather realistically they would remain neutral if a Taiwan scenario or a South China Sea scenario came to play. Only if there was a threatened invasion of South Korea itself. Would they take part in a war
---
I think you already answered your question in your post.

A formal Korea-Japan alliance will be hard to create due to historical antipathy between the two nations. Voters in both countries are more inclined to cheer for confrontation rather than conciliation.

On the question of whether they should, you said it yourself - it will provoke China-Russia-NK into forming formal axis against US-Japan-Korea alliance. It is difficult to see what could be gained from this.

There is also the question of whether a Korea-Japan alliance is even an effective counter against China. Combined, we have 180 million people and GDP of USD 6.3 trillion - doesn't seem enough. And Korea will be surely subordinated by Japan in this arrangement, which could be fatal as our interests don't exactly converge. An Asian land war would be devastating for Korea, but for Japan it might destroy a commercial rival.
---
Is the trilateral arrangement really benefitting SK? Think about THAAD, think about the Korea-Japan spat over the engagement of firing system, think about how US establishment torpedoes the NK summit, think about the territorial dispute with Japan. I see no downsides for SK staying neutral as these ”allies” don’t have SK interest in mind when they conduct their agenda, and have been doing more damage to SK than the “enemies”.

TITLE: Historical: Korean War Map from the George C. Marshall Museum and Library

COMMENTS:
The remarkable thing in that war was the vast distances the front moved in very short periods of time, and how close each side came to completely overrunning the country, only to be pushed back. 

Most people know the Korean War from MASH, which is set near Uijeongbu, just north of Seoul. The 'bug out' episodes of that show would have occurred multiple times over the course of a few months.
---
I still can’t imagine how China, fresh off a civil war  and recovering from Japanese occupation, was that effective against UN forces.
---
Chinese troops didn’t outnumber UN troops, not even 5 to 1... at the entry of China into the war there were around 200 000 Chinese. 
Unless you think South Korean soldiers weren’t soldiers, Chinese didn’t have the significant number advantage you have in mind. 

However due to better strategy, better infiltration and night fighting tactics, alongside the element of surprise and strong determination of the soldiers, China achieved local number superiority on the battlefield and pushed UN back despite having inferior firepower. China basically fought a maneuvring warfare using only infantry, which is impressive.

The casualties were relatively high indeed for the Chinese side, since the disparity of firepower could only be overcome by Chinese soldiers’s local number superiority and determination/bravery.
---
Did people write Incheon as “Inchon” in English before or is this a spelling error?
---
u/TopKekJebait explained pretty well. The total number of [PVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Volunteer_Army) is around 780,000 even going off wikipedia numbers. During the first phase of combat, Oct 25th 1950 to April 21st 1951, PVA consists of 9 armies and 30 divisions that totally number around 250,000 men. 20th, 27th and 26th army only committed parts of its strength. China rotated its roster around 3 times throughout the war. But consistently, because of logistic issues, China was only able to field around 300,000 men in the field. It didn't have a theater numerical superiority, let alone a massive one.

China is also building another 227 new trash burning plants near the Korean peninsula, deliberately located to take advantage of the natural easterly winds, away from the major Chinese populations as much as possible.

https://www.insight.co.kr/news/214681

These plants are even more dangerous than the coal plants because they burn toxic chemicals into the atmosphere which will inevitably float towards us.

South Korea needs to protest this, but the politicians are deathly afraid that there will be another THAAD-like crisis, where China gets mad at South Korea (for protesting too hard against China), and stops buying South Korean semiconductors and Kpop music. South Korea has invested almost half a trillion dollars in China since the diplomatic normalization in 1992, and it's building more and more high tech plants like OLED panel plants, semiconductor plants, and electric car battery plants - all of which the South Korean politicians are afraid that will be jeopardized by angering China.

But what's the point of protecting all those investments in China if we can't breathe?
---
So where are all the experts here who claimed China is doing everything they can to be environmentally responsible while SK is a dirty polluter who does nothing but blame China?

TITLE: Are these fishing boats? (dprk watching)

POST: I was going up the east coast of north korea, exploring on google maps, just kind of looking around, but when I got to Chongjin there were a couple places that really caught my eye. Here they are:

[First place.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/41°46'41.0%22N+129°49'46.9%22E/@41.7780508,129.8281534,467m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d41.7780477!4d129.829687)

[Second place.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/41°46'05.3%22N+129°46'39.3%22E/@41.7681386,129.7766766,274m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d41.7681373!4d129.7775761)

The first place at least does not look ice bound, while the second does (map info is apparently 2019, so probably winter). Apart from the ice at the second place, in neither place does it look like the boats could go anywhere soon--how long would it take to get those boats out of such a crammed up situation? It would have to take days.

[Wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongjin#Prisons) that Chongjin was hit hard by the '90s famine, that it has some prisons and a re-education camp, and that shipping is important.

Just SW of the second place, there appears to be a larger port, with only a few larger ships (and some smaller one). Also, there appear to be some rail lines leading over there, so that is probably where the 'shipping' takes place. 

The first and second places, above, appear tome to be fishing boats, stored away for some reason.

What do you think?

COMMENTS:
Yep. Assorted fishing boats.

If you pan over to the North-Eastern coast, seen [here](https://www.google.com/maps/@41.9542438,129.9672623,5329m/data=!3m1!1e3).

You can see the ice has melted and the fishing ships are utilised again. [No doubt, more lay off the coast](https://www.google.com/maps/@41.9501857,129.9819112,409m/data=!3m1!1e3)

Think of squid ships, farm ships, etc. Not sure exactly what they're for, but 100% bet it's fishing.
---
Yes, I saw some other spots with boats, just nothing on the scale of those two places in Chongjin. It made me wonder if they were even used at all--maybe the equivalent of a scrap heap, or junkyard.

Nice to see parking isn't any better in North Korea than it is in South Korea.

MRLS rockets aren't weapons and it did not breach the spirit of the inter-Korea summit /s

On a serious note, by definition, a difference between a missile and a rocket is whether it is guided or not and it is reported that the MRL system of North Korea, KN-09, is equipped with imagery-guidance and GPS systems, making them technically missiles. Regardless, it does not change a fact that the system is employed to attack South Korea with 70 to 200km range and KJU has just made people like you dumb idiots.

Did you read the article? Our government is claiming it has to do with change in UAE policy, but all industry experts are saying otherwise.

This is from the opening passage of the article lol

>문재인 정부가 2017년 ‘탈(脫)원전’을 선언한 뒤 국내 원전 부품 생태계가 급속히 붕괴하고 있는 데 따른 부작용이 현실화했다는 게 원자력계의 진단이다.


And more..

>원자력계는 탈원전 정책의 여파가 나타난 결과라며 아쉬워했다. 정용훈 KAIST 원자력·양자공학과 교수는 “한국이 UAE와 원전 동반자 관계였는데 이제는 용역업체로 격하됐다”며 “한국에 단독 계약을 주지 않은 것은 탈원전에 대비한 위험관리 성격”이라고 평가했다.

UAE-ROK nuclear deal was part of a larger strategic cooperation between the two countries, including defense. It’s been said that combination of the scandal surrounding bilateral defense agreement (which was signed under 2MB and renegotiated under Moon) and this admin’s policy regarding nuclear power most likely cast doubt over UAE government in regard to ROK’s commitment.

Per original agreement, basically everything related to UAE’s nuclear power was supposed to be carried out by ROK. We built the nuclear power plant in UAE to begin with.

While I’m not saying this turn of event was DIRECTLY caused by anti-nuclear policy, it’s more than likely was influenced by it.
---
where do you fall on the autistic spectrum?
---
Yep, they only failed to secure contract for one aspect of the whole program.

Still, it most likely would've gone to Korea if current admin had not so publicly distanced itself from nuclear power. Hoepfully whoever is elected next fixes this terrible mistake.

That was a quality piece of journalism.

>“When I first started campaigning against nuclear power, KHNP managers told me that an earthquake greater than a magnitude of 5.0 would never happen in South Korea,” he says. “But there it was.” Several days after his visit to the Wolsong plant, Kim discovered that one of the plant’s seismographs had been broken for years.

I hate when people talk like this, as if they are so sure of the inner workings of the Earth. Fucking negligent morons.
---
After watching some movie that's very unlikely to happen in Korea people just decide that getting rid of all nuclear energy is best for Korea. Short minded imbecilles.
---
Idk how a country with little to no fossil fuel reserves is going to meet its rapidly growing energy demands without some alternate kind of energy sources... like nuclear.

I was hoping stuff like Thorium Reactors would pick up due to their relative safety and less waste produced than traditional reactors, but fear mongering won out it seems.

To be fair, the recent earthquakes were caused by fracking. To be even more fair, broken seismographs are inexcusable.

>  **Article:**

SEOUL—North Korean leader Kim Jong Un gave the U.S. until the year’s end to break a deadlock in stalled nuclear talks, Pyongyang state media reported on Saturday, saying he remained open to a third summit with President Trump.

Mr. Kim, in his most direct remarks to Washington since February’s no-deal summit in Vietnam, said he doesn’t “need to persist” on pursuing another summit and isn’t desperate for sanctions relief, state media reported. He made the remarks on Friday at a gathering of North Korea’s rubber-stamp legislature, the Supreme People’s Assembly.

Mr. Kim warned the U.S. to change its approach to nuclear talks. He gave Washington “until late this year,” but added in an apparent reference to the Hanoi summit: “There won’t be as good an opportunity as last time.” The two leaders began discussions about North Korea’s nuclear disarmament at a summit in Singapore in June.

The North Korean leader called his personal relationship with Mr. Trump “great” and “not hostile,” state media reported.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump said a third nuclear summit with Mr. Kim “could happen,” though he vowed to leave U.S.-led sanctions intact until Pyongyang agreed to relinquish its nuclear arsenal. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment

After the Vietnam summit, Pyongyang blamed Washington for the outcome. The talks foundered because North Korea expected far more in sanctions relief than the U.S. was prepared to give in exchange for only limited concessions, diplomats said. The two sides appear to have had little contact in the past six weeks.

The North’s negotiating strategy for nuclear talks have emphasized Mr. Kim’s personal rapport with Mr. Trump but eschewed working-level talks. Some former U.S. officials say that approach left too wide of a negotiation gap, contributing to the impasse in Vietnam.

During Mr. Kim’s Friday address, he said the two could exchange letters and ask each other how they are doing at any time.

Since an initial exchange of threats after Mr. Trump came to office, the U.S. president has taken a similar approach on personal ties, saying last year the two leaders “fell in love” after Mr. Kim wrote him “beautiful letters.”

Mr. Kim has used tougher words for the U.S. government itself. In his annual Jan. 1 speech, Mr. Kim warned that if Washington misjudged the North’s patience, “we have no choice but to protect our country’s sovereignty and supreme interests and explore a new path to achieve peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.”

Then earlier this week, Mr. Kim told senior party leaders that the situation is tense, state media reported. He pledged to “deal a telling blow” to foreign adversaries “who go with bloodshot eyes miscalculating that sanctions can bring the DPRK to its knees,” state media reported, referring to the country by its formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

The North’s frustrations after Vietnam were apparent last month when a senior official threatened to suspend negotiations with the U.S. over its nuclear arsenal. The two sides disagree about the timing of denuclearization, with Pyongyang wanting a more gradual process.

The U.S. has signaled it could take a more flexible approach enforcing sanctions against North Korea if it prompts Pyongyang to disarm nuclear weapons. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on Wednesday he would like “to leave a little space” on sanctions.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the White House, where the two agreed to press forward their engagement with Mr. Kim.

After returning from Washington, Mr. Moon, who has embraced warmer ties with the North, planned to ask Mr. Kim to agree to another inter-Korean summit that could come as early as this month, according to local media reports. Mr. Trump also would be invited to Seoul by the end of June, as part of efforts to jump-start nuclear talks again, South Korean officials have said.
---
lmao.
---
Once North Korea establishes trade with South Korea, South Korea has an economic route of influence in which to force change in North Korea and internal change would also become easier once North Korea becomes connected to outside world. 

Strategy of isolation seemed like a good idea when North Korean government was heading towards a collapse but they're not anymore. China's not going to let that happen.

> South Korea

I lived in South Korea and everyone I met wanted reunification and had no hostility to the North or at least the Northern people. 

The US need to remain as it's a strategic military position. This is why 'they' are still at war.
---
I mean look, half of what people think they know about the DPRK is false this article is just illustrating a few examples of the propaganda machine working against the DPRK being caught out.       

Remember, South Korea and it's patron the USA are still at war with DPRK. Don't believe most of what you read about the state.
---
Dont be the same idiot who think NK is not as bad as everyone thought it is then going there and gets killed for it.
---
What were the peace summits between Trump and KJU for then?
---
>Idk the actual North Korean defectors ~~all~~ to the US, who are publicised tell horrific stories *which regularly turn out to be lies just like this very article is pointing out. 

FTFY. Funny how it's only defectors to the DPRKs enemies at war who ever tell negative stories and those to neutral countries or China don't make those kinds of claims. It's almost as if there was a propaganda machine working against the DPRK to discredit it during a time of war...  Oh wait, that's exactly what there is and has been in place for 66 years.

Hey guys, Kim is very smart and a sharp leader that deserves our admiration! In those words of Donald Trump, who likes him a lot (again his words) we should give him a chance. He’ll do the right thing and this example of his “strong leadership” that shows us as much!

COMMENTS:
Your post made me laugh out loud!  Thanks for that laugh.

I don't know what your objection is - Trump has made it clear that both Putin and Kim Jong-un are his buddies.

I also don't know why you would want to "watch the UK burn."  Or any country, for that matter.  

"align his priorities?"  I'm not sure I even know what that means.

Lots of mayors of big cities make comments about the national political scene - like the mayor of New York.  Trump has clearly shown that he has no respect for the UK with his actions in Scotland, his disrespect of the Queen and his interference in UK politics.  The Mayor of London has every right to express his opinion, whether you like it or not.
---
I'm not particularly a fan of Trump, but watching the UK burn is something I'm certainly looking forward to.

Instead, he has stated multiple times that there was plenty of evidence, just probably not enough to get a slam-dunk court case. And that he would have indicted Trump, except that the Justice dept states that you can't indict a sitting president.

Denuclearization will never happen. Kim knows that his shitty nukes are the only thing keeping the US from starting yet another regime change war. 

IMO he’s just shooting his shot at a chance to meet his favorite NBA players. Which is hilarious. Characterizing him as being “out of his mind” is pretty disingenuous. He’s clearly fucking around and has no intentions of getting rid of nukes at all, because that will be his regime’s death sentence.

"Promises Kim Jung-Un Wants to Keep." There's the shortest book ever written.

The GOP is nothing but liars and traitors.

Dementia Donald has left the security of South Korea in the hands of Kim's integrity. What a time to be alive.

Trump continues to defend our adversaries.  How is this not treason?

it doesn't matter how Trump changes his mind when his cabinet is stocked with warhawks that were too insane for key appointments in the post 9/11 Bush administration. That's also really easy to say when you aren't watching broadcasts of Lindsay Graham reassuring Americans that the consequences of nuclear confrontation will only affect Korea like a pudgy timid Dr Strangelove. All while dismantling the Iran Deal. It's not a jab at Trump so much as a basic recognition of the bellicosity and arrogance the entire world recognizes as the cornerstone of US foreign policy. Any leader with two brain cells to rub together knows that denuclearization on unilateral American terms means they overthrow your government in eight years.

> In an expected move, Kim Jong Un was re-elected as chairman of the State Affairs Commission at a session of North Korea&#039;s rubber-stamp legislature that took place on Thursday, Korean Central News Agency said.

> It&#039;s unclear whether the changes will be codified in the constitution, but analysts said the shake-up shows Kim has fully come into his own, eight years after he inherited rule from his father, Kim Jong Il. &quot;The transition and power consolidation of the Kim Jong Un regime is complete,&quot; said Michael Madden, a nonresident North Korea leadership expert with the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank.

That is wrong. There are multiple other parties in the Supreme People's Assembly, a social democratic party, a religious party, a party for Koreans living in Japan, and a few independents.

And I bet he still wins by a landslide.

No. Peace with North Korea would be amazing regardless of how tiny the hands were that shook to complete the deal. 

There’s one side that disregards facts for perception, and that side thinks that people are coming for their guns, that vaccines cause autism, and that humans aren’t causing climate change.  The rest of us live in an objective reality.

*The haircut? That's actually a political device. He decided very early on that one of the ways he was going to succeed was by looking like his grandfather, Kim Il-sung.*

*"Kim Il-sung is immensely popular in North Korea. He was the founder of the country. He was the guerrilla who, according to their own self-narrative, led them to victory.*

*"Kim Jong Un has never been in the military, he had none of that background, and so what he did is he draped himself in the family history. He put on weight, he started wearing glasses, he started walking like an old man – and this worked.*

Kim Jong-Un could only be called a winner by media outlets desperate to hate on everything Trump does.  What did he win? Nothing.  He got nothing and won’t get anything until things change.  

Trump didn’t win either, but suggesting he lost is just downright wrong.
---
Legitimize him to who?  Who is going to take him more seriously because he was in a photograph with the US President?  It’s a nonsense argument, no offense, but I saw plenty of that after their first meeting.  

Legitimizes him?  He is the leader of NK no matter if he meets Trump or not.
---
In world politics a simple photograph can speak volumes as far as an impact goes.  Meeting with the leader of the free world tends to legitamize you.  Did you not notice how kim was some how meetong with world leader aftef world leader directly following meeting trump?   Perhaps there could be a reason no other President would meet with such a man?   Also no need to be defensive mate, just a friendly chat ;)

“The President in particular is very much a figurehead — he wields no real power whatsoever. He is apparently chosen by the government, but the qualities he is required to display are not those of leadership but those of finely judged outrage. For this reason the President is always a controversial choice, always an infuriating but fascinating character. His job is not to wield power but to draw attention away from it.

Yeah and the Russians killed millions, Mao killed millions, what’s your fucking point? 

We’re talking about now. And right now, N Korea is locked down by a chubby little sociopath that wants a nuclear weapon. 

Your “I’m so enlightened and woke and your just a dumb capitalist” shtick is pathetic and petty. Going around thinking that everybody that lives in the US is concerned with just consuming goods and that the society as a whole is homogenized with the single goal of consumerism is the dumbest fucking thing I’ve seen. Get your head out of your ass and stop pretending you’re so much more smarter because you’re some faux communist fan boy. If you love Kim so much why don’t you go to N Korea and work for him. I’m sure he could use another idiot that would worship him as a literal god.

While I understand all of the words in that article, I'm having a hard time comprehending a situation where this type of thing makes sense.  

* What is the motivation for this?
* What type of overall strategy could this make sense in?
* What kind of move makes sense after doing something like this?

For many years, the North Korean Space Program was just a cover for their [ICBM program.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_North_Korean_missile_tests#2016)This is much like their nuclear program that they often claimed was "only for peaceful purposes."

Not surprising, many of their "space" missiles used the same delivery system as their long-range ballistic missiles. In [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Aerospace_Development_Administration#North_Korean_lunar_lander) North Korea claimed they were developing a lunar orbiter and lunar lander as part of a moon exploration plan.

>“Regarding our response to North Korea going forward, I completely agreed with President Trump in all respects,” Abe told reporters after a phone call with the U.S. leader. “Going forward, the United States and Japan will respond together, completely agreeing with a singular understanding on responding together.”

The unspoken part, of course, is that he knows perfectly well (even if Trump does not) that they have no real means to compel N Korea to do such a thing without costs neither country is willing to pay, and N Korea has absolutely no incentive to even seriously consider it, though they're perfectly willing to dangle it as a shiny object if it helps to achieve other objectives. They'd have to be either insane or stupid to eliminate their existing stockpile of nuclear weapons. So that is not happening.

I imagine Abe's statement is really directed  at Trump, and isn't really about N Korea at all.

Who would ever have guessed the amazing arguments like "Give up the only thing stopping us from invading you for nothing at all in return, or else" and "Hey here's a deal we gave to a dictator who subsequently got overthrown by his populace after we bombed his military into the dust because he had nothing to use as leverage against us, take it, or else" wouldn't have been smash hits?

Not that Bolton has any interest in disarmament, he's said it many times before he wants the talks to collapse so he has an easier time convincing anyone who will listen to begin bombing. The dude jacks it to damage reports from Dresden in the second world war.

Just in what universe do you live. Ending the sanctions on oil would make them able to run tractors and produce phosphate, which would end the food insecurity there just as it was before 1991.



>no, they don't have the right to "defend themselves" when they're calling to nuke Japan and the US.

Japan colonised them and the US invaded them and destroyed 30% of their country, a peace treaty was never signed. The US stages invasion exercises in their literal eyesight at their coast every week. After what happened to Libya, and what now happens to Iran, one can only hope they never abandon their nuclear program.
---
> I feel for the people living there

Then maybe start advocating the end of the sanctions.

>Any money provided is going straight into developing their nuclear weapons program to secure their position from being invaded.

So they don't have a right to... prevent themselves from being invaded?

While the intention behind the gesture is good, I can’t help but think that NK will just take this money and continue developing nukes, albeit more secretly. Kim jong eun isn’t stupid, he knows one of the only things not turning NK into Iraq 2.0 is nukes.

TITLE: North Korea: Nuclear talks with US won't resume without new approach

COMMENTS:
Are they falling out of love?!?!

Just basing my thoughts on facts. In multiple situations Trump is incapable of controlling his outbursts. The recent summit in Vietnam should not have happened. First Trump was preoccupied with Cohens testimony. The most significant other issue was Trump wanted a “win”, I don’t remember the exact specifics, but to my knowledge a advanced team of negotiators wasn’t sent to work out what would be discussed. And even if they were, I doubt Trump read them.

Although this isn’t normal times, when two leaders of countries come together, especially dealing with North Korea, past administrations would work out details. After a agreement of issues the President would have been briefed in depth what to expect. Trump obviously did neither, his love affair with Kim he felt would be able to solve any issues. 

After Trump and Kim meet, similar to his tantrums of he past and recent meeting with Congress he just left. 

I’d have to say the Kim family has found that taking a hardline, the US will eventually bend. 

There hasn’t been any studies to determine if he’s actually mentally all there, not joking.

> Moon said Trump supported his aid plan, but after promising to ease hurdles for humanitarian aid earlier this year, U.S. officials remain half-hearted, especially in light of the recent weapons tests, blaming the North Korean regime for the food shortages.

TRUMP: Hey Kim. Here's the deal. We'll jail your lookalike in Gauntanamo. And give you and your direct relatives new identities and set you up for life in NY city. Just gives a good enough reason to invade your land and destroy and kill and plunder to our souls desire. KIM: Ok.
---
The Trump administration may be remembered for royally fucking the delicate diplomatic balance prior administrations had carefully cultivated and maintained since the 50s to avoid proxy warfare on the Korean Peninsula. Turns out tactful diplomacy doesn't come naturally to just any rich orange man.
---
What exactly is Trump supposed to have fucked up? Like okay, he failed to get Kim to give up the nukes, but no amount of "tactful diplomacy" is ever going to accomplish that. The situation is no worse now than it was before.
---
No worse?  NK obtained Russian-designed short range missiles and successfully developed and tested its own long range missiles during Trump administration diplomacy. They're now armed with frightening force. 

That seems much worse than it has been in the last decades, although admittedly I have a lot to learn about the history of the Korean peninsula and NK military capabilities.

There are lots of examples of him being a bad negotiator. I like the one where he got one of the worst deals from his ghostwriter for his book "art of the deal" (link below). Also North Korea only really started testing icbms when Trump took office. And they seem to have resumed nuclear testing.

Trump was right to have talks with North Korea but he's not a good negotiator nor does he understand the situation which is why he was unsuccessful. He just wanted a Nobel prize. He could've listened to his own foreign advisors but thought it'd be easy. He's like a drunk guy performing surgery. Someone should do something, but leave it up to someone who knows how to. 

However you are right that the previous presidents should have made steps towards denuclearisation and Korean peace. The sanctions weren't helping and a different plan of action was and is required

Well, there's also the fact that on the one hand, Trump is saying he wants peace on the Korean Peninsula, but on the other hand Pompeo is saying that's never going to happen, and Pompeo is the guy who is heading the actual negotiations.

Kim is making the mistake of thinking that Trump is honest.  Trump says the US wants to work with North Korea towards denuclearizing the peninsula and normalizing US-NK relations, including economic incentives for NK.  Then Pompeo comes in and says "if you surrender all your nuclear weapons and technology, dismantle all your facilities, completely disarm the DMZ and surrounding regions, the US *might* not invade you".

> Kim is making the mistake of thinking that Trump is honest.

I mean, do you really think Kim doesn't know that Trump is a complete idiot, who crosses and betrays anyone he's been in business with? Not trying to be an ass, I don't think Kim is extremely intelligent, but he studied abroad, is familiar with the language, culture, and people in other countries. I wouldn't say it's a far reach that he knows Trumps game, and is just trying to play him the best he can. Denounce the United States as a whole, but play friends with the idiot in charge, who has the power, and stupidity, to make mistakes NK might be able to take advantage of.

I don't know, I just think it's a little myopic to assume Kim has NO idea who/what Trump is about. He's got to have some wit and intellect to stay alive in that country, especially considering the volatile nature, risk of assassination, and even keeping the entire place from tearing itself apart.
---
The DPRK have gotten what they wanted (propaganda for home consumption, elevation in their status, an end to war games, etc.) and know that Trump has no power to deliver anything more in his short time remaining in office.  Why waste time on pretense anymore?

Meanwhile, Trump got played...hard...and traded everything for one ultimately meaningless photo op.

"gangster-like stand" ... I mean, that's OK. But North Korea used to use much more interesting language in the past, like calling U.S. politicians "wolves" or racial slurs, or famously using the word "dotard."

It's pretty unimpressive on that score

Little Marco out here tweeting Gaddafi snuff pics and they want KJU to give up his shield? Good joke

Why would it? Doesn't sound like the US is ever going to ease up on the sanctions, so why should North Korea ease up on the nuclear facilities?

It's in their best interest to protect themselves, specifically from the United States. A nuclear weapons program does just that.
---
Their current position is to dismantle Yongbyon in exchange for sectional relief from five UNSC resolutions passed in 2016 and 2017 (out of 11 total), as a first step towards denuclearization. That is very different from removing all sanctions.
---
So, the same thing that's been said for the past 40 years.

Anyone paying attention knew this was going to be the outcome.

Trump was TOLD this was going to be the outcome when he first approached NK.

Well, Trump says Kim Jong-un is good people and he believes that Kim Jong-un will do all the nice things he's told Trump he will do...so is Trump not a good judge of character or something? He always picks great people to build his team around himself. I guess some of them have suddenly turned into bad people somehow. That's probably what's happened here. I don't remember North Korea doing anything bad under Kim's leadership. There was probably some kind of clerical error that lead to these executions. Those zany mixed up kooks in North Korea goofed up again for Pete's sake.

The way I see it: Every halfway sane person, espc. outside the USA can see Trump for what he is: A blustering clown, an idiot without the first clue of what he is doing.  


IF there is/was any change in the reaction of other nations to his nonsense, it is not bc. they realized what Trump is, but bc. so far they have not been sure whether he would have enough followers in senate and congress to follow up on his mad words and take action.  


Now every day it becomes more obvious that this windbag has no real power and pretense and make-believe is all there is.
---
Some people may not be old enough to remember this but George W Bush was also seen as a blubbering fool. He started a global war which we are still seeing the effects of. I’m guessing before the next election Trump/ his controllers will start a war in either Venezuela or Iran And then toss it over to the next democrat administration- who will then bear the cross of not being able to win an unwinnable war. History will repeat itself.
---
I dislike the headline as it implies that Iran and Venezuela are baiting the US into armed conflict. The truth is more the opposite, John Bolton and Pompeo are doing everything possible to cause military conflict that they can use to start a "defensive" war.
---
Given that the US violated an international agreement that the rest of the world was happy with for pretty much no reason and Iran spent a year trying to save it, I think the wrong one is being labeled as a Rogue State.

When you read even a summary of North Korea going back to the 50's. It is and always has been a terrifying rogue state NK is a running joke on Reddit but the regime has killed who knows how many people including American and South Korean troops, threatened, acted on threats up to boarding a us navy ship and taking the crew prisoner and trying to assassinate the SK leadership. Trump is a fucking moron.

TITLE: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday did not reverse North Korea-related sanctions on two Chinese shipping companies, a U.S. administration source familiar with the matter said.

COMMENTS:
> The source was responding to queries about a tweet sent by Trump earlier in the day that said he had ordered the withdrawal of sanctions announced by the Treasury Department - a statement that seemed to refer to an announcement made on Thursday of measures against shipping companies accused of helping North Korea evade sanctions over its nuclear weapons program.
The tweet was meant to refer to a decision to not go forward with additional large-scale sanctions on North Korea at this time, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Trump:  It was announced today by the U.S. Treasury that additional large scale Sanctions would be added to those already existing Sanctions on North Korea. I have today ordered the withdrawal of those additional Sanctions!

>WASHINGTON — President Trump undercut his own Treasury Department on Friday by announcing that he was rolling back North Korea sanctions that it imposed just a day ago.

>The move, announced on Twitter, was a remarkable display of dissension within the Trump administration and showed how actively the White House is intervening in policies that are traditionally handled by career officials in the Treasury and State Departments.

>Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the decision was a favor to Mr. Kim.

>“President Trump likes Chairman Kim, and he doesn’t think these sanctions will be necessary,” she said.

>Tony Sayegh, a Treasury Department spokesman, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Trump’s tweet.

TITLE: Trump will remove new North Korea-related sanctions because he ‘likes’ Kim Jong Un

COMMENTS:
Imagine for a moment if Obama had flown to North Korea for a PR  stunt, saluted a North Korean general, accomplished nothing, proclaimed North Korea no longer a threat, gotten misty-eyed describing how he "fell in love" with Kim Jong Un, and then when discussions ultimately fell apart decided to lift sanctions on one of the world's most brutally oppressive, despotic regimes anyway, because he 'liked' its dictator.

Republicans are traitors to the republic. Full stop. Guess it shouldn't be a surprise, given their affinity for the flag of their traitorous ancestors.

Per [Fox News' John Roberts](https://twitter.com/johnrobertsfox/status/1109217721126998016?s=12), the sanctions Trump said he is withdrawing are not in reference to the 2 shipping companies, but instead are referencing "new large-scale sanctions that were about to be announced by Treasury." White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters the decision was made because "President Trump likes Chairman Kim and he doesn’t think these sanctions will be necessary."

> DEVELOPING.May 3, 2019.JEJU, South Korea - North Korea fired a short-range missile off its east coast on Saturday, in a move likely to raise tensions as denuclearization talks with the United States remain stalled.

> In mid-April, the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un attended a test of what the country called a new type of &quot;Tactical guided weapon.&quot; That and Saturday&#039;s missile test signaled that Mr. Kim intended to escalate tensions in an attempt to gain leverage with the United States.

> Experts said the April test was likely a demonstration of a conventional weapons system, possibly artillery or antiaircraft - and also a message directed by Mr. Kim to Washington that North Korea would continue to amass weapons while the diplomatic standoff continued.

TITLE: Threat of decomposing Kim corpses could force North Korea to 'feed its own people'

COMMENTS:
I signed up:

>They  may have been dead for years, but a Japanese human rights activist  believes the embalmed bodies of former North Korean dictators Kim  Il-sung and Kim Jong-il can be used as leverage to force the present  regime to feed its own people instead of spending money on nuclear  weapons and missiles.   
>  
>Ken Kato, a director of Human Rights in Asia and a member of the  International Coalition to Stop Crimes Against Humanity in North Korea,  has written to members of the United Nations Security Council to request  that they halt the transfer of chemicals needed to preserve the  embalmed corpses, which are on display in glass coffins in the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang.   
>  
>Recent media reports have stated that the embalming work and regular  maintenance of the corpses is carried out by technicians from the Centre  for Scientific Research and Teaching Methods in Biochemical  Technologies - the so-called “Lenin Lab” - in Moscow, which first  embalmed and displayed Vladimir Lenin’s body in 1924.   
>  
>Experts from the institute have travelled to the North Korean capital  approximately every 18 months since Kim Il-sung, revered as the founder  of the nation, died in 1994 to ensure that his remains do not  decompose. The same work has been carried out on the corpse of his son,  Kim Jong-il, since his death in 2011.   
>  
>The cost of maintaining the corpses is not known, but estimates have put the figure at around £300,000 a year.   
>  
>In his letter to the UN, including one to Karen Pierce, the UK’s  representative in New York, Mr Kato calls on the Security Council to  “launch an investigation into the smuggling of chemicals from Russia to  North Korea in violation of \[the\] luxury goods ban” imposed under a  series of UN resolutions.  
>  
>Mr Kato  insists that the chemicals required to embalm the bodies should be  considered luxury items because they are not designed to improve the  lives and well-being of ordinary North Korean people.   
>  
>“I want to force North Korea to feed its own people before spending  tens of thousands of dollars every year on dead people in a mausoleum or  on nuclear weapons or missiles”, Mr Kato told The Telegraph.   
>  
>“Over the years, they have spent millions on building and maintaining  this mausoleum and now preserving the bodies that lie inside it, while  their own people have starved”, he said. “We should not be a party to  that willful neglect”.   
>  
>A UN report issued in early March said around 11 million North  Koreans, approximately 43 percent of the total population, are presently  in need of humanitarian assistance and called for member states to  provide aid of $120 million that targets, in particular, malnutrition  among children.   
>  
>A similar  request last year for $111 million in international assistance raised  only a quarter of the total. The international community remains  reluctant to donate out of concerns that aid enables the North Korean  regime to divert funds to its weapons programmes and to buy luxury goods  for the elite members of its society.   
>  
>Mr Kato suggested that denying North Korea access to the chemicals  required to keep the bodies of its former leaders from decomposing might  also weaken the present regime’s grip on power.   
>  
>As well as removing corpses that the public are required to revere,  he said, it would also underline the fact that the North relies on  foreign technology and know-how even for the most important members of  its society.

TITLE: Australian missing in North Korea Alek Sigley likely silenced ahead of Donald Trump visit, expert says

COMMENTS:
Obviously he has to suck up to the NK regime while living there otherwise he'd be executed (hopefully he isn't now). From what I gather he's just an academic trying to study North Korea.
---
Jesus christ I can't deal with this fucking media. When something horrible happens they always have to find a way to blame Trump so they can get clicks.
---
I dunno, I think it goes further than that. Reading [articles like this](https://amp-watoday-com-au.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.watoday.com.au/national/western-australia/he-s-the-29-year-old-perth-student-detained-in-north-korea-so-who-is-alek-sigley-20190627-p521ty.html?amp_js_v=a2&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQA) it comes across as a creepy obsession with North Korea. He's not just a simple academic, he's like a communist version of one of these alt-right trolls who was probably bullied and super insecure so is sucking up to North Korea on some weird hope that they'll nuke his haters and he'll be fine (a stretch I admit, but that's the vibe I get).
---
This guy sounds like a bit of a tool to be honest. By all accounts he sounds insufferable, pretty much 'defected' to North Korea to suck up to the regime as he's a North Koreaboo with a waifu and thought they'd treat him like a god. Smug punchable face too. Feel for the family but it's like, wtf, it's like he thought he'd be immune if he constantly tweeted propaganda and Best Korea memes.

> Nuclear talks between the U.S. and North Korea broke down after the failed summit between Kim and Trump in February in Vietnam.

> &quot;North Korea would like to remain patient, but it hopes the relevant party will meet halfway with North Korea to explore resolution plans that accommodate each other&#039;s reasonable concerns,&quot; he said, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. Xi&#039;s trip to North Korea, the first by a Chinese president in 14 years, raises the possibility that China could help break a monthslong impasse in talks between the U.S. and North Korea over the North&#039;s nuclear weapons.

> &quot;Kim Hyok-chol was investigated and executed at Mirim airport with four foreign ministry officials in March,&quot; an unnamed North Korea source said, according to the Chosun Ilbo, adding that they were charged with spying for the United States.

> It is worth noting that South Korea media and intelligence have made mistakes in the past, wrongly revealing one of Kim&#039;s former military chiefs was dead. In 2016, Ri Yong-gil was alive and in possession of several new senior-level posts after the South incorrectly reported he had earlier been executed.

> According to John Blaxland, Professor of International Security and Intelligence Studies and director of ANU&#039;s Southeast Asia Institute, the execution sent a clear message that Kim Jong-un and the North Korean regime have not changed.

This galaxy-brain thinks our military bases in Japan are purely for Japan's protection, and thus they should be paying us in full for our presence.

Don't get me wrong, I have some problems with America's projection of power, but him woefully misunderstanding the point of our various external military bases is unsurprisingly disappointing.

COMMENTS:
The entire world was ignoring the fat dictator and his antics and empty threats. It was Trump to who went to him and gave him the credibility and attention and acknowledgement Kim sought for. Now when Trump realized he doesn't play ball, suddenly he doesn't want the attention?

Edit: Watch some butt hurt Trump supporters going to downvote me for saying the facts.
---
As we all know, Trump is an expert in « small weapons ».
---
The whole world wasn't pandering to them. Yes, North were threatening SK and Japan w/ nukes and threats, and they've been keeping NK fed from starving. It's not like they were giving the NK regime money, it was mostly assistance and support in other terms. What Trump did was invite Kim and put him on the world stage, and made him Bigger than he ever was, or anyone in the Kim lineage. If Trump didn't feel like his ego needed a stroke and cozy upto Kim, he would've continued his empty rhetoric for handouts and everything would've continued the way it had for the past 50yrs.

> During the diplomacy that followed those weapons tests, Kim said the North would not test nuclear devices or ICBMs. The latest missile, which the North&#039;s media referred to only as a &quot;Tactical guided weapon,&quot; fell well below that threshold.

TITLE: Images show North Korea missile launch as Pyongyang tests Trump

COMMENTS:
Tests of short range missiles represent a nuclear threat to Seoul, which will do with a single missile what massed artillery would previously have been required for. This was a direct statement that, despite the removal of much of the artillery at the border, NK is still a direct threat.

There's no actual evidence the situation has eased at all.
---
Right, but that still threatens our allies in the area that are our primary reason for being against NK getting nuclear armaments.
---
Of course you see nothing wrong, because Trump has said nothing is wrong. However, this still threatens Seoul and the rest of South Korea, and potentially parts of Japan. We are responsible by treaty for aiding in their defense, and this is concerning in that regard. Trump's dismissal of this should concern you.

COMMENTS:
What "achievement"?  All Trump has accomplished is giving NK undeserved legitimacy.  Nothing about his two meetings could be described as an achievement.

It was to him. Which makes this funnier

They’re probably only doing it because they’re running out of food, and just need some more war machine propaganda.

Breaking...

Trump has just  reached a major deal with N. Korea.  He has transferred $150 billion USD into their central bank and they  get to keep all their weapons.

It won’t be an easy task for the authorities to select 100,000 people of the 300,000 or so people living in Sinuiju,” the source said. “The authorities may include people who committed crimes 10 or so years ago if they can’t find enough people to forcibly remove.”

>The eviction plans also appear aimed at ensuring the authorities face less resistance in tearing down existing housing blocks to make way for new construction. **“The authorities have promoted the plan as a way to get rid of criminals from the city, but it’s really to forcibly remove people for development,”** the source added.

1. No, it's not white supremacists. That label is just an absurd strawman attack used on people who support BREXIT or Trump.

2. Political violence is wrong. Period. Everyone has the right to express their political opinions without fear of violence no matter what you think of them. If you don't agree then simply don't vote for them. That is how a Democracy works.

3. There's really no such thing as an innocuous political stance. Politics inherently involves the threat of violence in even what you might perceive as the most egalitarian of missions. Take helping the poor for instance. Every dollar the government gives to them was taken by threat of force from another individual. There is no political belief one can hold that another person won't rightly see as imposing on them.

This right here is another example of why North Korea feels the need to nuclearize.

This is the n-th time that this right wing newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, reported very false news on North Korea. It's getting annoying at this point as a Korean-speaking expat living in Seoul.

Americans can emigrate, they can (theoretically) run for office on an anti-corruption ticket and be elected (some have done this successfully, if a little cynically).

In the DPRK 'trapped' means trapped. Thinking of leaving, watch out for the minefields/snipers. Running for office, sorry nope the incumbent is a God-Emperor.

Learned helplessness on the part of a populace that would ideally like freedom is a boon to any corporate or political oppressor. In a halfway functional democracy like America it's entirely possible to staunch the damage from cronyism. It does require effort, but if the Romanians, Tunisians and even the Brazilians managed to bring their kleptocrats out of office and in front of courts, what's stopping the Americans?

Im guessing they do not get told those odds by the sex traffickers who are moving them across the border and its not likely to be common knowledge in North Korea.

This is why. It's mostly North Korean girls trying to make it out of the dictatorship, shithole country of NK to find a better life. And then tricked/forced into trafficking. And less of a paper trail for a foreigner so easier to get away with.

COMMENTS:
True. 

I'm not in favor for the overzealous nature of the border patrol and i do believe some are in it for purely racist purposes. HOWEVER. I am a security guard, not the same as border patrol but, I've seen some fucked up things, and I know that if someone wants to harm or kill you, they'll often approach you with a smile. Not being kind makes both you and those you're charged with protecting safe. 

And border patrol has to contend with the fucking cartels across the border! Yeah no wonder they're fucking jumpy. The cartels are huge, well armed and most of its members have killed before merely to join, and have zero problems killing you if you pose a risk to their operations or for any other reason. 

The Mexican border is nothing like the Canadian one. Just because I'm against prison camps for children doesnt mean I'm against border security at all.
---
Agreed. And yeah, I wouldn't doubt that there are some racist folks. They can really be anywhere. I'd rather deal with that than the crime an open border can bring.
---
Oh yeah. If the border was open the cartels would seek to expand their territory and influence directly into the U.S. 

A LOT of people would be killed. It would be a long and bloody war to force them out even for the U.S army on their home soil.

TITLE: Trump-Kim summit 2.0: What you need to know

COMMENTS:
The problem with North Korean diplomacy as far as denuclearization is concerned is that the United States has shown in the past that the only deterrent to U.S. military intervention is the bomb.  Libya ended their nuclear program and Gadafi lived happily ever after... NOT!  What needs to happen is China needs to be a part of the talks alongside the U.S. and N.K. as a mediator and as a country that can promise security for N.K. from U.S. intervention.  

Another issue is, once North Korea and South Korea become united, what to do about the inevitable influx of North Koreans into South Korea?

I think a good solution would be to create free economic zones, similar to Hong Kong and Shanghai.  These zones would be places where foreign investers could develop cities using cheap North Korean labor, to at the same time help North Koreans get out of poverty, and have a 15 or 20 year transition time where the rest of the country is gradually recombined with South Korea.
---
Wow. Concise, insightful commentary about all parties and their respective agendas.  Well done. Would like a similar treatment of the on-going India-Pakistan conflict.
---
Exactly, the US wants NK to give up its most valuable card, in exchange for sanctions relief, which costs nothing, it's just silly all around, the two sides arent anywhere close to a deal, they're on opposite planets.
---
Is somebody really believe in North Korea denuclearization? The life of the Party and the government is tied with the nuclear program. Without it (and also the support of China, and Russia), the governement would fall and that could be the end of the country, for a reunification (IMO more an assimilation) with South Korea.

&#x200B;

For the last decades, the only goal for North Korea has been to sanctuarize its territory by acquiring nuclear power. N. Korea finally got it and is now able to get some leverage against the USA, which is unprecedented in the recent History. I cannot imagine what would make the N. Korea governement give up on it.

&#x200B;

Nice thread btw.

We have learned at least two things:

* North Korea/South Korea unification is not easy (if possible at all), because the social economic foundation does not yet exist. With the cultural roots the two Koreas can be friends and partners, have joint industrial parks, but unification is so much more complex even without considering other countries.
* Today's North Korea still does not have the leadership structure to start a China type reform like Deng did in 1978. What Deng did, from national level, was to allow some local governments more freedom to test out market driven economy. China ended up embracing globalization. This is exactly the same path followed by Vietnam. But the reason why North Korea was different than the 1980 China (Deng) or Vietnam (Linh) is that the Chinese/Vietnamese reforms were born out of crisis of the Communist Party's leadership, and eventually made the Party more responsible, and responsive. North Korea does not seem to have that urge at all.

My assessment is that the US/North Korea deadlock can not be fully solved until Kim gives up rights to another person who is not his offspring. In the mean time, we may witness decades of gradual loosen up of North Korea in economy but without real progress.

TITLE: How vital is China to North Korea talks?

COMMENTS:
Can't replace the Korean Armistice agreement with a Peace Treaty unless the original signatories of Korean Armistice (North Korea, China, US-led United Nations command) all agree to sign. Bilateral peace declarations aren't as nice as a full fledged Peace treaty.

Also, remember China's support was vital to introduce the harshest sanctions regime against NK in late 2017 after the ICBM/Hydrogen bomb tests, and this forced North Korea to come to negotiating table. 

Lastly, Kim-Xi summit occurred four (4) times, each time, Kim explicitly affirmed in no uncertain terms China's central role to the Korean peninsula security issue. 

But China doesn't have absolute control over NK. Koreans are fiercely nationalistic and operate on their own agenda. According to South Korean nationalists, China is an "enemy" of North Korea, so obviously China has no control over NK.
---
Extremely important. DPRK relies heavily on China
---
Honestly im surprised this is even up for debate. China is THE deciding factor as it has very strong relations with both NK and the US as well as South Korea. It is the key mediator and also has the political clout and funding to help with reunification efforts that the US will be unwilling to provide and SK will be very unlikely to afford on their own.
---
You can technically sign a peace accord without South Korea, but you can not sign it without China. This is one of the quirks of the Korean War as the Chinese, the Americans and the North Koreans signed the Armistice, but not the South Koreans. This is just one of the myriad of reasons why China is vital to the NK talks.
---
90% of NK’s trade is with China so they literally could force Kim to the negotiating table at any time but they have every reason to keep things the way they are. They don’t want a unified Korea with US influence at their boarder. Kim is a more desirable neighbor

TITLE: North Korea withdraws from DMZ joint liaison office after new US sanctions

COMMENTS:
**SUBMISSION STATEMENT:**

After the talks between President Trump and Lead Kim in Hanoi failed to produce a deal, the US has resumed the campaign of sanctions against the DPRK in an effort to motivate the North Koreans back to the negotiating table. Immediately prior to the closed discussion between the two leaders in Hanoi, Kim was quoted as saying that he would be [willing to completely denuclearize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_North_Korea%E2%80%93United_States_Hanoi_Summit#Second_day). However, as the private negotiations continued, North Korea aggressively demanded relief from the majority of US and international sanctions while offering only partial and vague promises of denuclearization of a singular site. This week, the US State Department announced sanctions on two [Chinese shipping firms](https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/north-korea-south-korea-summit-intl/h_89f717890e481b06678788b7a60f85aa) which were assisting the DPRK in circumventing and evading restrictions imposed by other sanctions. These sanctions were not contested in the American legislature and some members of Congress feel the President is not doing enough to enforce the existing sanctions.

In response, North Korea has withdrawn from this liaison office in the DMZ, a project supported by South Korean President Moon Jae-in. I'll let you read the article for CCN's perspective on the significance.


*My Thoughts:* I largely agree with [Chad O'Carroll](https://twitter.com/chadocl/status/1109001807550775296), cited by CNN as well, in observing that S. Korea is clearly not that significant in the DPRK (de?)Nuclear talks. North Korean web publications are echoing this sentiment, [questioning if S. Korea can really play the role of "moderator"](https://twitter.com/dagyumji/status/1109022749559681024) (as Moon Jae-in has tried to position) when the South seems subservient to US policy. For that matter, I suppose that I largely agree with the North Korean pundits - South Korea is just as much of a back seat driver in these talks as Japan is.


*Discussion Suggestions:*

- While Chinese trading with the DPRK is a teeny-tiny percentage of China's annual trade and there are certainly more ways of trading with the North than just these two shipping companies, do these sanctions have any meaningful effect on US-Chinese relations, particularly with the ongoing trade talks?

- What are your thoughts on the role/significance of South Korea in the DPRK-US negotiations? Is the Souths' position based solely on the fact that Korea was once united? Is it even realistic to consider re-unification? Have the two Koreas grown so far apart that they will never be more cordial than neighbors?

- Do these sanctions, and those of the international community strength or weaken the DPRK and/or US' position in the ongoing dialogue (albeit, a dialogue that is now on hold)?

In an interview on The Heat, Martin Jacque who wrote the book "When China Rules the World" he described that Western thinkers cannot understand China from a Western point of view.  One part that is fundamental to Chinese thinking is "Stability, Unity and Order." 
So, here's North Korea and there's no doubt about it, China doesn't want any Nuclear tests near it's northern borders.  But if they try to force an American style regime change, how many refugees who cannot speak mandarin will flee?  How many refugees will flee toward South Korea?  Would the US take advantage of this disunity in North Korean government and move forward?  Is it worth the risk and how much is there to gain?  How would South Korea react to China taking over ancestral Korean land?  Would this push South Korea and Japan further into American sphere of influence?  
These are the questions I would be asking if I were in Chinese leadership.  It might cause more problems than it's worth.

TITLE: I wouldn't discount a war between the USA/Israel against Iran, or a war between the USA and North Korea sometime in the next 5 years. Chances would be even greater if Trump gets re-elected.

COMMENTS:
I find the possibility of war in Iran always to be overblown. Its an intensely mountainous country that doesn't threaten our core interests.  The US army couldn't occupy that country if we wanted to.  

A nuclear Iran does threaten us, but not existentially.  That problem would be better solved with precision strikes or working through 3 of the other regional powers; Turkey, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.
---
US lived with Israel, Pakistan, and India with nuclear weapons, and will do the same with North Korea.

Any threat of war is not credible, not after Trump said: "NK nuclear threat is gone" and "I am in love".

Nobody would take US threatening war against seriously, and South Korea is adamantly against war for obvious reasons. How to break US-KOR alliance instantenously? go to war when even your South Korean allys don't want it.
---
You vastly underestimate how little the Israeli public would want to engage in a war against Iran, 1200 miles away from Israel. Israel can only go to war against Iran only under the most serious of serious situations, and even then the Iranians would never directly engage in war against Israel, because there is no upside for Iran. 

The only way Israel goes to full blown war against Iran is if there is a serious attack on Israel from Iran. Except that would never happen. Iran has the convenience of using Hezbollah to do its war for them, without really losing anything. 

Thus, your entire prediction is total war porn. You should try understanding Israeli public sentiment before you make such ridiculous assertions. And if Israeli public sentiment against a war in Iran is high, then it certainly would be the case against in America, even further away.
---
You can vote, you can lobby Senators or Congressmen to represent your interests. I thought US was a democracy.

Indeed, Kim is a despotic tyrant that does horrible things to his people and should be thoroughly condemned by all in international community.

However, what Kim does to his own people is outside of your control. It's better to focus your energy on what you can control - preventing US from engaging in endless wars which she has no obligation or business to be in. That's what's inside your control.

TITLE: North Korean arrogance is not a strategy

COMMENTS:
Nothing, absolutely *nothing* the US can offer is worth as much to NK as nuclear weapons. Treaties aren't worth the money they're printed on because the next administration might just void them as a fuck you to their predecessors. Stop sanctions on NK and integrate them into the global economy over the next decade and then we can maybe talk about denuclearisation.
---
This talk about denuclearization is honestly nothing but a big theater. There is simply nothing the US can offer to NK for them to get rid of their arsenal.

NK took decades to acquire their nuclear weapons and getting rid of them would be final and irreversible, while everything the US can offer such as removing sanctions can be changed at the stroke of a pen. It's a completely unbalanced premise.  Moreover US credibility on the world stage is in tatter and NK no doubt paid close attention to what happened to the Iran deal. There are huge uncertainties on the future of US foreign policies as well. If Trump gets replaced by a democrats in next elections, who can tell if that POTUS wouldn't revoke a deal with NK ?

And this is without even taking China into account. In my opinion that circus is allowed to take place because both parties find it helpful. Trump can flaunt himself for some foreign policy "success" with that "historical" meeting and detente on the peninsula while the North Korean regime gains prestige and international credibility from it. Any chances of a breakthrough from it is almost non-existent though.
---
They’re not just looking at the Iran deal. They’re more importantly remembering Libya.
---
The strategy was to obtain nuclear weapons. This was accomplished. The US was the reactionary party in this affair, as the fact of North Korean nuclear weapons was what changed the status quo, while the US's threats of retaliation were what led to the summits after South Korean mediation. That the summits failed to produce the results both parties desired is perhaps not surprising. But it doesn't change history. The value of nuclear weapons to North Korea remains even without having secured a withdrawal of US sanctions and military exercises; the regime's life line can always be obtained else where, after all, especially now that it has nuclear weapons and thus more cards at the table.

The article also misses the mark when it comes to its projection of future trends. US-China competition is not going away, and it isn't contingent on the trade war. It will only grow in intensity as China seeks to reestablish itself as the hegemonic power in its own back yard, in which case North Korea's value to both parties can only increase. Kim has no problems playing the waiting game, and having nuclear weapons helps him do just that.
---
Following the no-deal outcome of the Hanoi summit, Kim and his administration are reverting to posturing. Missile testing, verbal attacks on the Trump administration and the Putin meeting are all symbolic of this. It is unlikely to lead to any good progress on the denuclearisation front.

TITLE: What to make of a mysterious break-in at the North Korean embassy in Madrid

COMMENTS:
An opinion piece written by Andrei Lankov, a leading expert on North Korean politics and culture and author for NKNews, analyzing four potential groups behind the recent raid of the North Korean embassy in Madrid. 

In the article, Lankov discusses why the least unlikely group behind the raid is the CIA. He also discusses why the so-called Cheollima Civil Defense group is likely a front for a different group, potentially the CIA. 

Edit: If there’s a paywall, I think it can be bypassed by going to Lankov’s tweet link here:

As another poster commented, the CIA is not this brazen. They don't do things in the middle of the day like that with the world to see. It's not their MO. With that being said I would be surprised if the CIA isn't at least in communication with whoever did this kidnapping.
---
> This author showed the official pronouncements of the group (Cheollima Front) to two well-educated native speakers of Korean who, independently, came to the same conclusion: the documents in questions were initially written in English and read like a translation (one of the native speakers said “clearly, a translation” while other said “very like a translation”).

> On top of that, they believe that people who translated the text were not fully comfortable in the language – as one of my experts put it: “this text seems to be written by a foreigner who knows Korean very well.”

I just checked the website, and can confirm this. They don't even bother translating the word "diaspora" - they just transliterate it, which no average Korean would understand, instead of saying the proper term (해외 동포).

And the use of their terminology is inconsistent as well - they alternate between "Bukhan" (South Korean name for NK) and "Joseon/Bukjoseon" (NK name for themselves).

Do you think CIA still has positions available for a Korean speaker?
---
This is the part that bewilders me the most. Cheollima is pretty obviously a front for a different organization, so why couldn’t they do the bare minimum to make it seem convincing? Native Korean speakers who speak near perfect English abound. Very strange.

TITLE: CIA implicated in attack on North Korean embassy in Madrid

COMMENTS:
There's not enough information in the article to come to that conclusion. After all, the article says that the CIA itself was not implicated, just that two of the ten perpetrators "have been identified and have connections to the US intelligence agency." Given the nature of intelligence work "having connections" to any agency could rage from an actual current officer of said agency or that they were contracted previously on a freelance basis. I personally don't believe the Trump administration would directly authorize this kind of thing five days before the Hanoi meeting, it's just so brazen and outside of regular intelligence gathering activities. Unless there was a really really urgent need to do this kind of thing. It's possible that this was the work of another actor (state or non-state) that tapped two professionals that had CIA work on their resume to carry out this mission. I don't think much will come out from this, there's this clue in the article:

>The highly secretive investigation will be heard at Spain’s High Court, the Audiencia Nacional, which could order the arrest of the identified assailants. Government sources, however, admit **it would be difficult to prove the CIA was involved in court.**

Emphasis mine. First the authorities would have to arrest the two individuals who have had more than three weeks to flee the country. Then they would have the difficult task of proving CIA involvement in the incident. The media could play this up as a major scandal and the Spanish government could publicly rebuke the U.S. due to domestic pressure, but without a viable legal case against the CIA very little would change the Spanish-American strategic relationship at the policy level.
---
Either A) it was an uncharacteristically reckless move by the CIA, B) It wasn't the CIA, or C) something was achieved by the CIA, it was worth the PR hit, and CNI just aren't aware of how or what
---
This attack is not damaging to NK though. Nothing was achieved, from all appearances.
---
I think you read too many spy novels.
---
Ss: The CNI (the Spanish equivalent of the CIA) implicated the involvement of the CIA for the recent assault on the North Korean embassy in Madrid. It is truly shocking and beyond my imagination. It is a reckless move especially in this volatile moment. Why should the US approve such dangerous and provocative move especially during negotiations?

TITLE: The North Korean Question, a South Korean perspective.

POST: SS: The world in which we live in is anarchic in nature and states strive to survive in with all means available. That is the essence of international relations and unrealistic idealism would be detrimental for the general well-being of a nation if not the world itself. 

That being said, North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons, while very dangerous, is understandable in their perspective. The disparity of power between North Korea and South Korea is beyond comparison and NK is threatened not only from the US-KOR alliance but potentially also from China. A toothless North Korea will be practically a vassal/satellite nation of China and that I believe is against the interests of North Korea (and also against the interests of South Korea).

The situation in the Korean peninsula is precarious and volatile, so people who live in South Korea would rather prefer some kind of modus vivendi with our unstable and dangerous neighbor rather than cornering it to the brink and waiting to see what happens. In my opinion, maximum pressure just to wait and see would be a dangerous gambit for it increases chances of misunderstanding and some foolish actions from either parties. 

I consider myself a liberal and I am thankful that I was born in a liberal country like South Korea and I am deeply against the North Korean regime, I despise its nature, its cult of personality and its heinous abuses on ordinary citizens, yet I believe that it is not in our interest to raise human rights issue every time we negotiate with them. For example, the US and other Western nations have no problem dealing with Saudi Arabia (another notorious regime), Turkey, Russia and China. It would be utterly hypocritical to deny recognition of NK solely on the grounds of human rights. Therefore, it is beyond me why some American media should be so obsessed with North Korean human rights when they are neglecting the same issues in Saudi Arabia or in Israel. Of course, Human rights and individual liberties are important but raising those issues at this moment would not be very helpful. If history has taught us anything, living conditions and individual liberties are better promoted by active engagement and economic growth. Alexis de Tocqueville has also said that oppressive regimes fall not when they are most oppressive but when they try to reform themselves. 

On the other hand, I'd like to stress that America's posture (especially those of the media) towards North Korea is not very constructive. Unilateral imposition of one's will is not diplomacy, it is a diktat. The US could force unilateral disarmament if it overruns North Korea in a full-fledged war but that is not the case. We are negotiating and North Korea has also interests which it deems vital. 19th century Europeans have been acutely aware of this fact. Diplomacy was the art of the possible, not a crusade to impose one's will. 

Of course, North Korean nukes are a threat and they must be contained, but you cannot contain them with sanctions and pressure alone. We have tried that medicine for decades but they have not worked. And as more time is wasted (without a deal), the more deadly they become. So we need to point the very core issues which have brought about this crisis in the first place. I believe that our government and Trump's administration were addressing those factors (previous to the Hanoi Summit) to finally make a workable settlement on the Korean peninsula. 

Another issue I'd like to address, is that so often, American media portrays South Korean liberals as some kind of anti-american left wing crusaders when they are not. The main support base of the current liberal government are middle-class, students and professionals. We are the most pro-Western, pro-American generation of all, and the culture of individualism and democracy is deeply ingrained in our hearts. In fact, Korean right-wing elderly share more in common with the average North Korean (insofar as they support a strong leader, collectivism, and fervent ethnic nationalism) than the younger generation. So Korean liberals are not anti-american at all, we just want to have a fairer treatment and we want our interests be acknowledged. 

I believe that Russia is also a key player which should be reckoned with. The main rival, perhaps the only rival for the United States is China. And I as a South Korean (as well as the majority of our population) am deeply anxious about the possibility of a Chinese hegemony in the region. Therefore, I believe that it is of utmost importance to come to terms with Russia in order to contain China, just like Nixon did with Mao's China to deal with the USSR. In the process, I think that pipelines and railroads connecting South Korea via North Korea to Russia is important so that we could import cheap energy and be able to invest in Russia. I believe Russia would be more friendly to South Korean firms and capital rather than Chinese since we do not pose a threat to Russia's interests. 

In addition, I believe that if a pipeline connecting Russia and South Korea were to be built, Russia could have a restraining effect on North Korea's behavior. Given that natural gas is the main source of income for the Russian state, they will exert pressure on North Korea if it behaves badly and becomes a detriment for one of its best customers. A Russo-South Korean pipeline will be a win-win scenario for all parties involved: South Korea gets cheap gas, Russia gets additional revenue, and North Korea can exact transit fees. In the process, I believe we could lessen North Korea's dependence on China and make them some kind of a new Vietnam: A potentially useful ally against Chinese expansion. 

Of course, this might also be in the realm of wishful-thinking but I believe it would be a worthy option to try. I believe South Korea and the United States should in the short term, freeze North Korea's nuclear program rather than complete dismantling (which is unrealistic anyways), and then proceed with normalization of relations and open mutually profitable projects which focuses on the economy. Without nukes, North Korea would be completely exposed to a potential Chinese aggression and they may not feel compelled to come to terms with us, not because they think we are going to invade them but because they could become defenseless against a third party also. Therefore, North Korea may retain some capabilities (albeit with limitations) for the time being.

The North Korean question is perhaps the greatest riddle of East Asia which has the potential to completely change the power dynamics in the region. We need a great deal of imagination and caution as well as innovation when it comes to this difficult problem.

COMMENTS:
>The disparity of power between North Korea and South Korea is beyond comparison and NK is threatened not only from the US-KOR alliance **but potentially also from China**.

70% of DPRK's armed forces are located below the Taedong river near the DMZ. (Positioned against US-KOR alliance)

25% are protecting Pyongyang capital, while the remaining  is based along the Chinese border, mostly as border patrol against defection on Yalu/Tumen rivers.

North Korea's doesn't believe China is an existential threat, otherwise the NK troop deployment would significantly increase along Yalu/Tumen border.

&#x200B;

>**A toothless North Korea** will be practically a vassal/satellite nation of China and that I believe is against the interests of North Korea (and also against the interests of South Korea).

How convenient it is to ignore the vast stockpile of biological and chemical weapons.

Pre-2006 NK was not a vassal/client of China, precisely because of this biological/chemical weapons (majority pointed at US-KOR alliance)

&#x200B;

>\> And I as a South Korean (as well as the majority of our population) am deeply anxious about the possibility of a Chinese hegemony in the region.

That's ironic, because China has been the hegemon of East Asia for over 2000 years.

Peace has reigned with Korean Kingdoms allied with China, and Koreans Kingdoms got destroyed when they tried to contain China's power.

&#x200B;

>\>  Therefore, I believe that it is of utmost importance to come to terms with Russia in order to contain China, just like Nixon did with Mao's China to deal with the USSR.

US can contain USSR because US-USSR trade was negligble.

US cannot contain China because US-China trade and Russia-China trade is humongous, which gives China tremendous leverage to prevent a containment alliance against it.

&#x200B;

>\> In the process, I think that pipelines and railroads connecting South Korea via North Korea to Russia is important so that we could import cheap energy and be able to invest in Russia. I believe Russia would be more friendly to South Korean firms and capital rather than Chinese since we do not pose a threat to Russia's interests.

The problem is that Russia views US troops in Korean peninsula as a potential threat to Vladivostok and Siberia, not unlike how Russia views US-NATO expansion in Eastern Europe as a strategic threat to Russian security interests.

Russia essentially thinks South Korea is a US puppet, and likely trusts China more than South Korea as a result.  Also, Russia wants to keep Korea divided in order to maintain influence in Asia, a strong Korea is against Russian interests because it's pro-US.

&#x200B;

>\> In addition, I believe that if a pipeline connecting Russia and South Korea were to be built, Russia could have a restraining effect on North Korea's behavior.

North Korea will never be allowed to be controlled by Russia just to make an extra buck.  A transit fee for pipeline is too little money for North Korea to give up it's sovereignty and foreign policy decision-making.

&#x200B;

>\> Given that natural gas is the main source of income for the Russian state, they will exert pressure on North Korea if it behaves badly and becomes a detriment for one of its best customers.

North Korea can exact pressure on Russia to limit gas supply to South Korea as a political pressure to reduce US-SK military exercises or withdraw US troops from Korean peninsula.

&#x200B;

>\> A Russo-South Korean pipeline will be a win-win scenario for all parties involved: South Korea gets cheap gas, Russia gets additional revenue, and North Korea can exact transit fees.

While European Union is trying to reduce dependence on Russian gas supply, the South Koreans would be trying to setup dependency with the devil.

Why is EU trying to diversify and move away from Russian gas supply, while South Korean trying to increase dependency on it?

It's a strategic mistake to make.

&#x200B;

>\> In the process, I believe we could lessen North Korea's dependence on China and make them some kind of a new Vietnam: A potentially useful ally against Chinese expansion.

In the process, you become dependent upon Russian gas supplies, which they can use as a political tool against US troops in the country, such as limiting/reducing US-KOR alliance military exercises.

&#x200B;

>Of course, this might also be in the realm of wishful-thinking but I believe it would be a worthy option to try.

US-Russia animosity is at an all-time high.

China-Russia friendship is at an all-time high.

China-North Korean friendship is at an all-time high.

Yes, what you are proposing is to reverse all that, for the sole benefit of South Korea.  That's wishful-thinking.

&#x200B;

>Without nukes, North Korea would be completely exposed to a potential Chinese aggression and they may not feel compelled to come to terms with us, not because they think we are going to invade them but because they could become defenseless against a third party also. Therefore, North Korea may retain some capabilities (albeit with limitations) for the time being.

North Korea has chemical and biological weapons, and North Korea doesn't feel an existential threat by China, and North Korea-China relationship is at an all time high.

This is just wishful nationalistic fantasy by South Korean nationalists

>The North Korean question is perhaps the greatest riddle of East Asia which has the potential to completely change the power dynamics in the region

The power dynamic has already been changed since US abandonment of Chiang Kai Shek, and US abandonment of South Vietnam, and US failiure on North Korea.

&#x200B;

It's just the South Koreans engaging in wishful thinking about containment of China when the Cold War is over, they are living in another old era and refuse to accept the new reality.

&#x200B;

>\> We need a great deal of imagination and caution as well as innovation when it comes to this difficult problem.

The most likely solution is the wholesale permanent division of Korean peninsula into two sovereign states for a couple centuries.

This is a good solution for every nation involved, because a unified Korea is too nationalistic and likely to engage in irredentism, which China and Japan will never allow to occur.

&#x200B;

> And I as a South Korean (as well as the majority of our population) am deeply anxious about the possibility of a Chinese hegemony in the region.

Well, you might claim so but you only speak for yourself. Perhaps you should think carefully and take stock about why you're so anxious (if for no other reason than anxiety can take a toll on one's health). China's advancement - I won't use the term "hegemony" - is inevitable, and opposing or resisting it to alleviate anxiety might lead to some very bad outcomes. 

> Therefore, I believe that it is of utmost importance to come to terms with Russia in order to contain China, just like Nixon did with Mao's China to deal with the USSR.

That just isn't in the cards. Nixon exploited an already existing deep fissure between China and the Soviet Union - no such thing exists today. Far from it, in fact; both governments describe their relationship as the best it's been in history. There are very good structural reasons for a strong and abiding China-Russia relationship that I touched on previously here:

https://np.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/6513u2/how_china_and_russia_avoided_the_thucydides_trap/dg6mmuy/

and here:

https://np.reddit.com/r/Sino/comments/7fpao4/the_state_of_china_studies_in_russia/dqdxpov/

There is nothing that America or anyone else can offer Russia that would cause it to break its partnership with its most powerful and important partner. A lot of Western observers essentially hope that this is all a lie and that the relationship is, in their words, a "marriage of convenience" (ignoring that such marriages can be very stable and enduring). They wish the relationship was false, but... if wishes were horses, beggars would ride.
---
> Nationalism results in manipulation of reality to fit their self-serving agenda of "Divide & conquer".

I would argue that it's a sense of helplessness and weakness, not nationalism, that induces this magical thinking. A drowning man will grasp at straws, as they say. It's strange to me that their nationalists are so opposed to living under China's shadow, when generations of them have lived under America's shadow. What's so bad about China's shadow?

They'd no doubt give some response about values and democracy and whatever else. \*Pffft\*, as if China cares about their governing system or their values. They can vote every time they go to the bathroom for all China cares. China just wants the "Three No's": no US troops, no US bases, no US alliance; in return, South Korea gets no problems.
---
> That doesn't mean Russia would absolutely be against a pipeline.

Yes, but pipeline with Russia/North Korea is a double-edge sword. 

Russia highly dislikes US troops close to it's borders (just like China), it's the reason why Russia aided North Korea during the Korean War (because it hates US troops close to it's border).

So Russia can easily use the gas supply as political leverage and pressure against South Korea, and obviously North Korea can cut off supply anytime it wants by shutting the valve that transit it's sovereign territory.

>If Russia really wanted to avoid interacting with said puppets in this manner, it wouldn't have made any of the steps I just made, and rather just turn to China instead.

Russia favors North Korea because it's a buffer state between US troops in South Korea and the Russian Far East. 

So you cannot "bribe" people with money, and hope they flip allegiance. Russia's security interests will ultimately trump economic interests if push comes to shove, Russia will always back North Korea as a buffer state against South Korea.

>You yourself said North Korea wasn't a client state of China until 2006, what prompted the shift was obviously economic in part. In North Korea's perspective, playing the numerous states in the region is more beneficial than relying on one and falling too deep within its influence.

Beggars can't be choosers. 

North Korea does not have the luxury to play superpowers off each other because North Korea's foremost concern is regime survival, and they have nothing valuable to offer Russia or China to "play" one off the other. 

>If North Korea can't pressure China into, say, limiting South Korean imports as political pressure to achieve the goals you've mentioned above, what makes North Korea able to do the same with Russia?

North Korea and China are aligned on issues regarding US bases, US troops, US alliance on the Korean peninsula.

North Korea doesn't need to tell China to impose defacto sanctions post-THAAD deployment, it's instructive that China did it entirely themselves because China highly dislikes US troops and US THAAD which threatens not only China but North Korea as well.

Russia and North Korea also both hate US troops, US bases, US alliance, so they will naturally use Gas supply as a political weapon if necessary.

>But in South Korea's perspective, one could argue that it is beneficial to diversify the country's energy imports,
>It would simply be another source of energy, not somehow become the main source overnight.

If Russia is just a minor energy source for South Korea [in effort to diversify], then the opposite logic will be true: South Korea will be a minor energy destination market for Russia.

Ergo, this undermines the argument that Russia can "tame" or "control" North Korea over such negligible minor energy exports. It almost isn't even worth for Russia given the volatile nature of NK regime to risk so much investment for such little gain.

>> China-North Korean friendship is at an all-time high.
>This and the two prior claims are subjective.

Kim-Xi summits in China for four (4) times, and anticipated Kim-Xi summit in Pyongyang soon.

At each one of these summits, Kim and Xi extolled that the traditional Sino-Korean alliance is reaching ever new heights.

Obviously, South Korean nationalists has glass-tinted lenses, and refuse to accept when the leaders of both China/NK say their friendship is at an all-time high, since Korean nationalists has their own self-serving agenda to exaggerate differences in China/NK alliance.

>>North Korea has chemical and biological weapons, and North Korea doesn't feel an existential threat by China, and North Korea-China relationship is at an all time high.
>Yes to the first one, and the two are subjective and thus debatable.

​70% of DPRK's military is deployed at DMZ, 25% in Pyongyang, and only 5% along Yalu River.

So Mathematically, North Korea's military deployment numbers disprove SeoulLite's assertion that China is an "Existential threat" to North Korea.

If it was a threat, then deploying negligible 5% of military (mostly for defection control) along Chinese border isn't support your case. The math doesn't support your argument.

Also, Kim-Xi summit happened four (4) times already, far more than KJI-Hu Jintao summits or KJI-Jiang Zemin summits, so that's empirical proof that the two leaderships treat each other as deep strategic allies.
---
That's a lot of nice text, but who are you even trying to convince?

I mean, given the results of the summit, looks like even the Americans don't agree with you. Bar complete North Korean capitulation to American demands, I think it's looking more and more clear that the Americans don't want Korean integration. 

And it makes sense. Eurasian integration mainly helps Eurasian countries. Why else has America been such a obstacle against other forms of Eurasian integration?

Yes, I think this fantastical Korean right-wing scenario you've posited looks to be on its last legs.

US (spearheaded perhaps by Bolton?) looks to have blown the summit on purpose and scuttled Moon and Trump's convenient scenario of Korean economic integration for Trump's Nobel Peace Prize.

If that's gone, will Kim and North Korea fold, flip on China, and jump into waiting American arms? Doubt it. I think the chances Kim willingly puts his life in the hands of Bolton given America's recent history of regime change... that's gotta be a probability hovering around 0. 

North Korea's got a relatively strong hand. They can always turn to China and Russia for capital and technology. I'm guessing they'll hold for a better deal and wait for South Korean desire/desperation for economic integration to push the South Koreans away from their US alliance.

And given recent reports of North Korean rebuilding of satellite launch/ballistic missile launch sites, looks like Kim really is looking to hold out.

Like I said before, next steps looks to be in Moon's hands. We're looking at either pre-Trump tensions with Kim turning further towards China/Russia or US/Korean alliance breakdown.

The fact that we are only finding out about this now comes across as more surprising than this actually having happened. It's clear there was some mixed messaging going on during the Hanoi talks that led to the collapse, but it's still crazy. Negotiating with North Korea knowing that if they collapse could lead to the deaths of the people you're talking to isn't something that weighs pleasantly on the other party.

---
"It was one of the most concrete agreements to come out of the first  U.S.- North Korea summit last year, but now the Pentagon says it has given up hope of recovering any more remains of U.S. troops killed in  the 1950-1953 Korean War in the near future."

It's not that people don't want good things. It's that Trump and his base are so profoundly ignorant they fall for these ruses over and over again.

Back during the NK summit fiasco his supporters were flooding Reddit claiming he had done what no other president *could* do and bring NK to the table.

In reality, everyone with any formal education on the subject knows getting the US to let NK sit at the big kid's table has been a central policy goal of theirs since at least the 90s. No other president was dumb enough to take the bait, then along comes Trump.

He and his base are so dumb they'll embarrass themselves on the international stage over and over again and then declare victory.
---
Right. A reality TV star who doesn’t read getting a pinky promise from a regime that has death camps would totally have worked out and wasn’t just his arrogance on display.

And then of course the whole lying to the country about actually accomplishing anything. 

Nothing but noble deeds right here.
---
Yeah, screw trying to work peace out without using bombs and murder.

In your face Trump! Suck it!!
---
I'm just curious what you think they got out of this? We can go to war just as easily tomorrow as we could a year ago, and they haven't performed a nuclear test or ballistic missile launch  in months, which has certainly delayed their program at least a little.

TITLE: North Korea Executed and Purged Top Nuclear Negotiators, South Korean Report Says

COMMENTS:
Pompeo’s thoughts:
  
>ABC News This Week's Jonathan Karl asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the rumored executions on May 5. Pompeo didn't confirm or deny them. "It does appear that the next time we have serious conversations that my counterpart will be someone else, but we don't know that for sure," he said, smiling. "Just as President Trump gets to decide who his negotiators will be, Chairman Kim will get to make his own decisions about who he asks to have these conversations."
---
Pompeo knows it looks bad to compare Trump to the dictator of North Korea, right?
---
>Four officials of the North Korean Foreign Ministry were also executed, the South Korean daily reported, without providing any hint of who its source might be or how it obtained the information.
>South Korean officials could not confirm the Chosun Ilbo report. North Korea has not reported any execution or purge of top officials in recent months. 

I think South Korean newspapers have been known to report on rumors of executed officials that later turned out to be alive, but since the officials lost some titles and stopped being mentioned in North Korean state news, something must have happened to them, if they were not outright executed.

COMMENTS:
Wow, no wonder they walked. US sanctions are one thing, but those UN sanctions are never going away without NK completely getting rid of their nukes.
---
Thing is there's 50 million things for sanctions, 50 million things for them to dismantle their nukes. Sanctions mostly try to focus on the elites there, can't send their kids to Europe or US to be educated, can't import this or that, but there's stuff that I'm sure would hurt NK citizens too. Demantling, can't import this or that, must have people on the ground to check. And I'm paraphrasing, but it's true, there's everything they have to go through what they can import, and things you wouldn't even think of. Plus, we already have sanctions on  Venezuela and Russia, and trade negotiations with China. Long story short, there's a lot of moving parts, for the most part sanctions are meant to target the elites, but I don't know what else can be done, China and Russia are fine with propping them up.
---
Even if the Trump administration had accepted the deal, France and UK would have had to accept the decision as well, considering that they have the veto option at the UN security council. Russia and China have it too, but they are probably ok with any agreement to reduce sanctions.

Except in the case of the Korea's you can always count on some rabidly anti-communist South Koreans to make up fake news just to make NK look already worse than they do. I have no idea what you think they accomplish by willingly making themselves look like more savages than they already are.

Sex trafficking is a global problem with terrible repercussions.  Trafficking hotspots can be in unexpected places.

You can check if where you live is a sex trafficking hotspot.  If you’re like me and live in the U.S., the state department has a guide on how you can help curb human trafficking
[Curbing Human Trafficking](https://www.state.gov/15-ways-you-can-help-fight-human-trafficking/) 

The U.S. national trafficking hotline is tel:1-888-373-7888.  You can use this number if you suspect someone is a victim of human trafficking.

Anyone who thinks we have a bad sex trafficking problem in the USA, just know, it's about a million times worse in China and India.

Edit: since some of you are calling in the point of my comment, it was to point out that we think sex trafficking is a large problem in the USA. A certain politician has used it as one of his reasons for needing a wall. However, international sex trafficking in the USA is actually very minimal, compared to national sex trafficking (women who were born and live in the usa being forced into prostitution, generally it's runaways and drug addicts, rather than how they are forcefully kidnapped or bought and sold like in other countries). Other, less developed, countries usually have a far greater problem with sex trafficking. Movies like taken make it seem like a problem for USA citizens abroad, when in reality, it's more common for a us citizen to be lured into it in the USA. We also tend to think we have a large sex trafficking problem in the USA, but compared to the majority of countries, we rank way lower on the list. Women are literally bought and sold in other countries, not just between North Korea and China, but many other countries. India is huge on the list, as is the war torn middle eastern and Africa  Countries.

That's not how any of this works. You can't just say "off the record" and suddenly it's illegal for reporters to report on what they're seeing. If it's classified, he just declassified it by letting them see it.
---
The president has the right to declassify any document at any time. So the options here are:

He implicitly declassified it by showing it to them. In this case, it is not illegal to take a photo of.

Or 

  He waved around still classified documents in front of a reporter. Sharing those documents is a crime on his part if they are still classified.

Well that should help Biden's poll numbers.

Kim Jong-un is playing Trump like a fiddle. He's already extracted more concessions from him than his father or grandfather could ever have conceived in their wildest dreams. The president of the United States, the Leader of the Free World, is at Dear Leader's beck and call. North Korea has never looked stronger, and those pictures of Trump shaking Kim's hand and saluting his generals will haunt us forever.

TITLE: Kim Jong-un sets conditions after Trump suggests third summit

COMMENTS:
Not only did Trump legitimize Kim, he's now become Kim's bitch
---
I remember when Obama said he would meet with Iran unconditionally. The GOP roasted him for that. Now, we got NK dictating conditions. Look how far we've fallen.
---
Kim is asking for sanctions relief and offering almost nothing in return.

He's also posturing as if he has all the leverage in the negotiations, he's not saying "give us this and we will give you that."

He's saying "give us this or else."

Trump is the moron that gave him all of that leverage when everyone else with half an interest in foreign policy told him that this would be the result.

Kim is acting like he's a legitimate actor and trying to pretend like he isn't a brutal dictator that oppresses his people, a stance that is only possible because of the fact that Trump handed him these summits on a platter. 

When the first meeting happened, the Trump cult acted like he had accomplished something, but he hadn't. He is incapable of actually finishing this.

They're blaming Trump for "lavish praise" of KJU, not that their son was killed. It's like you didn't even read the title.
---
Not really.We're just blaming Trump for being a stupid piece of shit blabbing nonsense he didn't have to say and hurting the family more. 

No need to suck up to a scumbag dictator while the world laughs at you and you get nothing in return but praise from Fox News who do that anyway.
---
Not a peep on Fox about Otto. But they complain no other network talks about infanticide
---
No one is blaming Trump for Otto.  They are blaming him for praising and siding with the brutal dictator who had him captured, tortured, and killed while holding him hostage.

No one is blaming Trump for Puerto Rico's electrical system either, just his poor response time, response funding, and response to crisis that led to avoidable loss of life even months and months after the hurricane.

Don't just listen to the talking points.  Talking points are barriers that are used to buy time until people stop talking about something and some get what they think is a satisfying answer.

It doesn't matter how much you feed his ego - he will always screw you because he likes to do that, especially to toadies.

Trump would pretend a nuclear blast didn't happen if it meant he didn't have to admit he was wrong.

I’m not ok with nuking anyone, anywhere. Any who are are the ones under the “devil’s influence”

> OSAKA - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he would like to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this weekend at the demilitarized zone on the border of North and South Korea.

> &quot;While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)!&quot; Trump said on Twitter.

> The White House on Friday declined to comment on whether Trump was scheduled to go the DMZ. U.S. special envoy Stephen Biegun said on Friday the United States was ready to hold constructive talks with North Korea to follow through on a denuclearization agreement reached by the two countries last year, South Korea&#039;s foreign ministry said.

---
Trump really believes when he walks out on a meeting, it is the ultimate power play. He walks out, brags about what he did, then offers to meet again. Bragging and asking for another meeting that you just walked out of is weakness. If you are going to use walking out to your advantage, you walk out and decline all offers and refuse to entertain the topic. Then the other party knows they do not want you walking out in the future on other topics.

Kim sure knows how to string Trump along. Still making nukes, but praising Trump enough to allow Trump to take his side against CIA reports.  

Its also interesting this is happening right after President Xi visited North Korea and got this huge reception.  Like a visiting emperor.  Something Im sure Trump took notice of.  And envies.
---
Two morons jerking one another off.

Kim Jong Un is quite clever. The idea that he’s goofy and stupid is the fault of his portrayal in our media. I’m by no means defending any of his actions or policy, but it’s important to recognize that a political leader has to be examined through multiple lenses.

trump is the exception that proves the rule; trump is a fucking idiot.

TITLE: Trump's interview with Time went off the rails after he showed a new letter from Kim Jong Un

COMMENTS:
from the article

> Trump abruptly told the reporters: "Okay, now I'm going to show you this letter. So this was written by Kim Jong Un. It was delivered to me yesterday. By hand." Then they went off the record and the letter wasn't mentioned again until Trump started pushing back on details from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report.

> The Time reporters noted that Trump confidante Corey Lewandowski had testified "under threat of prison time" that Trump told him to order then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit the Mueller investigation. Trump had just denied trying to limit the investigation. Things got weird:

> **Trump**: Excuse me — Under Section II — Well, you can go to prison instead, because, if you use, if you use the photograph you took of the letter that I gave you ... confidentially, I didn't give it to you to take photographs of it. So don't play that game with me. Let me just tell you something. You take a look —

> **Time**: I'm sorry, Mr. President. Were you threatening me with prison time?

> **Trump**: Well, I told you the following. I told you you can look at this off-the-record. That doesn't mean you take out your camera and start taking pictures of it. Okay? So I hope you don't have a picture of it. I know you were very quick to pull it out — even you were surprised to see that. You can't do that stuff. So go have fun with your story. Because I'm sure it will be the 28th horrible story I have in Time Magazine. ... With all I've done and the success I've had, the way that Time Magazine writes is absolutely incredible. 

[Time interview transcript](https://time.com/5611476/donald-trump-transcript-time-interview/)
---
Section II, Article II of the US Constitution.

Trump has been citing it quite often, claiming it says he can do anything he wants.

That's clearly not what it says or means, but, that doesn't exactly matter to Trump.
---
>Time: I'm sorry, Mr. President. Were you threatening me with prison time?

>Trump: Well, I told you the following. I told you you can look at this off-the-record.

Confirmed. The president is evil Michael Scott. He thinks saying "off the record" means something legally.

>Donald Trump freaked out and threatened a Time magazine reporter with prison after the publication’s photographer apparently tried to take a snap of a letter sent to him by Kim Jong Un. Trump reportedly asked to go off-the-record while he showed off the letter to reporters, but then became enraged after the photographer appeared to try to capture it. “Excuse me—Under Section II—Well, you can go to prison instead, because, if you use, if you use the photograph you took of the letter that I gave you ... confidentially, I didn’t give it to you to take photographs of it, so don’t play that game with me,” the president is quoted as saying in the transcript. 

Trump used to just threaten to sue everyone, I guess prison is on his mind these days.

TITLE: Trump picked Kim Jong Un over the CIA. Is anyone surprised?

COMMENTS:
Just like the time he listened to Putin over the entire fucking intelligence apparatus.

He's convinced, thanks to the kissasses that surround him at the White House, and the conspiracy mongers on Fox, that the intelligence agencies of this country are out to get him because reasons.  Add that to his authoritarianism fetish, and his belief that "I didn't do it," is a rock solid defense, and you've got the situation we're in now.
---
They see big penis shaped nukes when they stare deep into each other’s eyes.

\>  are out to get him because reasons.  

The reasons being that he has been committing crimes (obstruction of justice) or involved with those committing crimes (Manafort, Gates, Papadapolous, Cohen, Sater).

He's bringing this on himself, but being the narcissist that he is, he can't see why what he is doing is the problem and he just blames everyone else.

>“I will say it again,” Trump continued. “I think that North Korea has tremendous potential — and he’ll be there. I think that North Korea — under his leadership! But North Korea, because of what it represents — the people are great, the land is great, the location is incredible between Russia, China, and South Korea. I think North Korea has tremendous potential. And the one that feels that more than anybody is Kim Jong Un. He gets it. He totally gets it.”

He gets that Trump wants to rule America like Kim Jun Un rules North Korea.

* We know [Putin has funneled nuclear fuel and other materials to North Korea](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/north-korea-russia-oil-sales-sanctions-violation-latest-a8134126.html)

* We know [Kim and Putin have met privately on many occasions](https://www.apnews.com/98f0c046e9174241873433928cf955ec)

* We know [Russian banks have helped North Korea](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/03/635465039/russian-bank-hit-with-sanctions-for-helping-north-korea)

* We know Russia helped Donald Trump win, based on the conclusion of our entire intelligence apparatus [and Trump himself](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/05/trump-admits-russia-helped-him-win-denies-it-20-minutes-later)

* We know [Trump and Putin have met privately five times and we have no record of what they discussed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/us/politics/trump-putin-meetings.html)

* We know Trump has concealed the content of his meetings with Putin [even from his own administration officials](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-has-concealed-details-of-his-face-to-face-encounters-with-putin-from-senior-officials-in-administration/2019/01/12/65f6686c-1434-11e9-b6ad-9cfd62dbb0a8_story.html?utm_term=.280409b84b55)

* We know Trump has [repeatedly met North Korea's desperate attention-mongering by legitimizing them](https://www.macon.com/opinion/article213046499.html)
* And now we know that Trump is *helping* North Korea and *defending* them in contradiction to *his own administration*, including the notoriously insane John Bolton. 

So, I'm not even going to bother making conclusions here.  You can just read this bewildering, astounding series of events, events that are undeniable, and ask yourself what in the holy fuck is happening here.

>"I just received a beautiful letter from Kim Jong Un ... I appreciated the letter," the President said.

>When asked whether there would be a third summit with Kim, Trump said he hoped so but did not want to get ahead of progress.  
Last month, Trump said he still believes North Korea "would like to make a deal" and left the door open for a third summit despite a new warning from Pyongyang urging the US to change the course of its negotiations "before it is too late."  
"I think they would like to make a deal and we would like to make a deal," the President told reporters during his recent visit to Ireland, adding that he looks forward to seeing Kim "at the appropriate time."

Trump forms bromances with dictators, fascists, and authoritarian leaders and he is also an imbecile on top of that.  That's why every day is a real time reality television parody.

>Kim Hyok Chol, who led working-level negotiations for the February summit in Hanoi, was executed by firing squad after being charged with espionage after allegedly being co-opted by the U.S., the newspaper said Friday, citing an unidentified source. The move was part of an internal purge Kim undertook after the summit broke down without any deal, it said.

>Speculation has swirled for months about the fate of Kim Hyok Chol, who hasn’t received any recent mentions in state media dispatches. Previous South Korean media reports about senior North Korean officials being executed following the talks have proven false.

>Kim Jong Un’s top aide Kim Yong Chol, who was also involved in the summit, is reportedly undergoing hard labor, according to the Chosun Ilbo report.

I have been reading about this all day, and the more I have thought about it, the more I am amazed at the lack of emotion from Pompeo and the Trump Administration. It is really really disturbing and gross. 

I know they are assholes, but this is crazy that they can't even denounce this? They can't say, this is unacceptable? This pisses me off as much as Kim being an evil dictator piece of shit tiny man.
---
they are just envious.
---
If the president* cancelled the summit because of Cohen’s testimony, then this would mean that real people were executed as a direct result of his temper tantrums.
---
During the shutdown (another one of his tantrums), people couldn’t get their insulin and other medications. Possibly people died because of *that* tantrum. Migrant children have died while being kept under the family separation policy. That wasn’t from a tantrum, I guess, but Trump has really adversely affected peoples lives. I suppose all Presidents do, but at least they usually seem like they *try* to avoid it.
---
Earlier this week, Trump dismissed some missile tests from NK, contradicting his own NSA, and Japan's prime minister, by saying "perhaps he(KJU) just wants to get attention, or perhaps not, who knows?".

So, my guess is, he doesn't give a fuck.... he's trying to protect what he thinks is his shot at a Nobel Prize.

TITLE: North Korea executed top officials after Kim-Trump summit failed

COMMENTS:
Imagine if your life depended on Trump actually bothering to prepare for, or even giving a slightly sincere shit about the results of something created merely as a media event to distract from his continuous rampant corruption. Then they don't even make it through lunch. You'd be better off running through 2.5 miles of the heavily mined section of the DMZ wearing snowshoes.
---
Wow. Now conservatives are pushing lies for violent foreign dictators? 

[You realize that piece of shit killed one of our own? Tortured him for months.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Warmbier) And here you are defending him...
---
Dude is young . He was born in ‘83. Only took power 8 years ago
---
Trump is dying to do this shit himself.
---
I've never understood why people claw for power in regimes like this. What do they get out of it that it's worth risking the very high chance of getting killed?

Better food and access to Western movies?

How is that worth dying for?

It's like when I'm watching a movie or show set during the Tudor dynasty. An awful lot of the "name" people eventually end up getting executed. If I had lands back then, I'd have gone and lived on them and stayed out of court politics.

Some regimes, the best thing to do is to stay far away from them as possible.

Which leads me back to my original point...I've never understood why people claw for power in regimes like this.

Is this really Trump's tweet in response?

TITLE: Hanoi summit failure? Not quite — Kim now owes Trump big time

COMMENTS:
No the fuck he doesn't. Kim got yet another propaganda gift basket from Trump in exchange for absolutely nothing. The summits are a win for him regardless of their outcome. He can broadcast to his people that the President of the United States is at his beck and call, and that North Korea is finally getting the international reception it deserves.
---
Bullshit.

>Yet, despite those dire assessments of the immediate outcome, the meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong Un, in fact, greatly strengthened Washington’s longer-term negotiating position and advanced the prospect of North Korea’s denuclearization, either peacefully or by a return to the maximum pressure campaign.

Allow me to translate:

>*"Now that Trump has performed his annual massaging of his lover Kim's taint, the US can continue our long-term position of continuing to do what it we have done for decades OR Trump can peacefully continue to massage Kim's taint."*

Let's not forget:

TITLE: The Hanoi Summit Was Doomed From the Start | North Korea Was Never Going to Unilaterally Disarm

COMMENTS:
Of course they weren't. Kim already got what he wanted when Trump agreed to the summit. He can now stand before his people and tell them that the President of the United States, the Leader of the Free World, is at his beck and call. This is why previous presidents denied North Korea the legitimacy of a meeting.
---
Not to change the subject too much but having read trump supporters comments here and on twitter many of them believe he was the first POTUS  to be able to GET a meeting with the leader of north korea. As if previous presidents had asked and been denied.

TITLE: Hanoi Failed Because Trump Refuses to Prep for Summits

COMMENTS:
Being president is largely an academic job.  Trump is the most intellectually lazy person ever to hold the office.   Low information voters love him because he’s one of them.
---
>Trump Refuses to Prep for ~~Summits~~ Anything.
---
Just for fun, let's consider President James K. Polk.

(Disclaimer: There's a lot to criticize about Polk, particularly about his treatment of Mexico and the fact that he was a slave-owner. However...)

James Polk's campaign promise was to serve only one term and to add Oregon to the US. During those four years--

He successfully negotiated with Great Britain to get Oregon, and also got Montana and Washington in the bargain.

He started, and ended, a war with Mexico to get Texas. Later he got Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado.

During his term, he worked constantly and obsessively. In four years, he never traveled more than four miles from the White House.

On his last night in office, he stayed up all night doing paperwork--making sure to leave no loose ends for his successor and ensuring a smooth transfer of power.

He had begun his term at age 49 with brown hair. Four years later, he was a physically frail white-haired old man of 53. He would live only three more months after leaving office.


Polk may be an extreme example, but he *is* an example. There's no such thing as "too much work" in the job of President. You can literally work yourself to death like Polk did. (FDR did, too, but it took longer.) 

Polk worked too hard and accomplished a great deal. Not naming names here, but I think we can find examples of what happens with Presidents who work too little.
---
Add to this that he doesn't really want to achieve anything as president. And why should he because telling his base he accomplished things is as good as accomplishing them for real.
---
If it involves that thing called "effort" he's NOT down.

TITLE: What's next for US-North Korea ties after Hanoi summit failure?

COMMENTS:

---

The worst part of all this is the fact that NK and Kim have been legitimized by Trump.

Future Presidents will have to treat them similarly in the future as opposed to ignoring the tantrums of a child throwing his toys.

TITLE: The Hanoi summit collapse reaffirms Trump's amateur hour in diplomacy

COMMENTS:
The Hanoi summit was a panic stricken desperation move to steal headline and chyron space to suck air out of the unending explosive revelations about the president and his family’s crooked deals.

There wasn’t even a framework of a deal in place. These people are completely winging it.
---

TITLE: White House declines comment on North Korea purge, keeps focus on denuclearization

COMMENTS:
Trump got elected. People died
---
> White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders declined to comment on Friday on reports that North Korea has executed its nuclear envoy in a purge of officials who steered negotiations for the failed summit between Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump.

> “I am not going to comment on intelligence one way or another. I can tell you we are monitoring the situation and continuing to stay focused on our ultimate goal, which is denuclearization,” Sanders told reporters at the White House.
---
Avoid that North Korean job listing on Indeed
---
They really do need to focus on denuclearization, since after his high orangeness made a "deal", the administration looked the other way as NK improved its nuclear capabilities leaving it more dangerous than before. They wanted the noble so bad they let NK grow its capabilities in the dark.

"Force of Personality" is just a lazy euphemism for shamelessness.   It's a winning strategy when you're stiffing small contractors, not so much when you're dealing with international relations.

COMMENTS:
>In his first public comments since President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met in Vietnam last month, Stephen Biegun, the US special representative for North Korea, told a Washington audience Monday that the administration wants Pyongyang to give up all of its weapons of mass destruction before anything else.

>“We are not going to do denuclearization incrementally,” the envoy said at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s nuclear conference. “The foundation of US policy is denuclearization.”

>But it’s not just nuclear weapons: The Trump administration also wants the complete removal of chemical and biological weapons from North Korea, Biegun said, meaning the US wants Pyongyang only to have conventional weapons by the end of the process.

>Let’s be extremely clear about what this means: If the US maintains this position, any chance for the US to convince North Korea to part with its nuclear arsenal is gone.

Mission Accomplished?

He’s right.  Let’s wait until the new President shows up in 2021.

Hey, what's wrong with this guy, doesn't he know he's dealing with the "best negotiator" in the world?  Kim cleaned Trump's clock - remember when Trump was beating his own drum about a Noble Peace Prize?  LOL.  What a fool, what an embarrassment to the US.

Tough talk from a third world nation. Too bad this administration is lowering the US to their level.

Sounds like they need another summit. With my third commemorative coin, I’ll almost have enough to buy an Arizona Iced Tea.

TITLE: North Korea says talks won't resume unless US changes position on disarmament

COMMENTS:
This is what happens when you remove maximum global pressure by allowing non-binding bilateral talks that go nowhere.  Now there’s no pressure on China or Russia to obey sanctions, and now North Korea doesn’t need what we were offering.  They won’t ever make a denuclearization deal unless they are in a position of desperation, which Kim no longer is, thanks exclusively to Trump.
---
I think that's less devils advocate and more stating the obvious with a rhetorical question.
---
Playing devils advocate here- why would they ever give up their nukes when the US has repeatedly shown that they don't respect sovereignty unless you have them?
---
Yeah us credibility is in the toilet when it comes to foreign affairs. I don't blame other countries for not trusting us to keep our word.

I’ve theorized for a long time now that that’s exactly why he’s so friendly to these dictators and autocrats.
---
That’s because he isn’t the great negotiator he wants everyone to believe. He doesn’t want there to be more witnesses to his idiocy.
---
No. He thinks a breakthrough is possible and he wants all the credit because he wants a Noble Peace Prize. He also probably doesn’t want anybody else there because he’s clearly willing to compromise almost anything to get his Nobel and accolades. He also probably thinks he can benefit personally (i.e. get a hotel there or something).

The arrogance of this failure to think he can handle this on his own is just insulting

So we honored the request because it’s what Kim wanted, he gave us nothing, has taunted and threatened us after both meetings, and we’re considering giving them another meeting. MAGA?
---
Not sure if trump wants bilateral talks with NK as he would have to share any agreements with another person.

Is he still trying to convince Kim Jong that he can build beautiful casino resorts in NK, in exchange for a nuclear arms agreement?

“Hey, if you give up nuclear arms development, I’ll let you put my name on a hotel.”
---
No doubt because Trump will call it a success, regardless of what actually happens.
---
This is a solid plan, because it is well known that South Korea, Japan, China and Russia have zero vested interest in the DPRK. Classic Bolton.
---
Which is great and all, except for the part where Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France all have to sign off on any sanctions relief if they were applied by the UN (which most of the North Korean sanctions are).
---
Indeed. Perhaps Kim just needs to rewatch that sweet property development video Trump gave him during NK Summit 1.  I thought for sure that would be enough for him to reconsider his ways as the world's most brutal and oppressive dictator.

> North Korea says it has test-fired a new &quot;Tactical guided weapon&quot; with a &quot;Powerful warhead&quot;, the first such test since talks between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un ended without agreement.

> The country claims it has developed a nuclear bomb small enough to fit on a long-range missile, as well as ballistic missiles that could potentially reach the mainland US. North Korea analyst Ankit Panda noted that the latest announcement followed fresh US-South Korean military exercises, describing the reported test as &quot;Tit-for-tat&quot;.

>In a briefing with reporters on Wednesday, a senior State Department official made a stunning remark when asked if the Trump administration agrees on how to handle the complexities of talks with North Korea.

>“Nobody in the administration advocates a step-by-step approach,” the official said. “In all cases, the expectation is a complete denuclearization of North Korea as a condition for all the other steps ... being taken.” In other words, for Pyongyang to receive any kind of benefits like sanctions relief, it has to dismantle its entire nuclear arsenal first.

>That contrasts greatly with the administration’s past stance and immediately led experts to pan the comment — and the Trump administration’s negotiation strategy.

Maybe, if Trump weren't an unprecedented stain on the presidency there would not have been hearings investigating his behavior...

What he is trying to prove is that sitting presidents should not be investigated.  What it really proves is that Republicans were derelict in their oversight duties for the two years that they controlled the house.  If they had investigated in earnest from the get go, there would not be an avalanche of investigations now....


And while we are talking about the two years that were pretty much investigation free AND saw both chambers controlled by his own party, let's remember that he did not accomplish anything that the GOP can present to voters.  Nothing.

And then Trump pulls out of the agreement and puts sanctions back on Iran, even though they were following the denuclearization! Why would North Korea trust any deal now with the US? And of course all this benefits Russia because Trump has reduced the US to an untrustworthy nation that doesn't hold it's end of the bargain.

As a guy from Kansas, let me make this clear: Mike Pompeo is a whipped dog with no spine in public, and he's worse in private.

Tbf, Trump could have done worse, by either dropping major sanctions (he did suspend one set of them) or else pulling out US troops from South Korea.

>“The President’s constant refrain is that Kim is his ‘friend’,” said one of the officials, who has tried to present Trump with the unanimous assessment by multiple agencies that Kim remains wedded to his nuclear program, both as a family mission and as a deterrent to any U.S.-led effort to overthrow his regime.

> President Donald Trump has taken increased control of negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, sidelining his own top negotiator and dismissing the warnings of top intelligence and foreign policy advisors in the wake of last month’s failed summit in Vietnam, officials familiar with the developments tell TIME.

> In recent days, Trump shut down an effort by Stephen Biegun, nominally the Administration’s lead negotiator with Pyongyang, to reestablish a back channel through the North’s United Nations mission in New York, according to four U.S. and South Korean officials.

> At the same time, Trump continues to dismiss the conclusions of the CIA, State and Defense Departments and other agencies that North Korea will not abandon its nuclear weapons program, continuing to insist that he and Kim can negotiate a deal, according to two U.S.officials.

>The bill is called the Otto Warmbier Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea Act, after the student who died after being returned from North Korean detention in a coma. Its sanctions are modeled after ones against Iran in 2010 and 2012 credited with bringing Tehran to the negotiating table.
Supporters say the bill, which would impose secondary sanctions on financial entities doing business with North Korea, is necessary to target those helping Pyongyang evade existing sanctions. The secondary sanctions are expected to particularly hit Chinese banks.
“They would present Chinese banks with a very simple choice: You can do business with the United States or you can do business with North Korea, but you can’t do both,” Toomey said.

But Bloomberg reported earlier this week that the president was in fact referring to penalties on Chinese shipping companies, but said White House officials had convinced him to back off and devised a “cover story” for the president’s tweet.* We all knew this was the case and I stated as much at the time.

This guy has no clue about North korea. He think North koreans are suffering because of sanction. Only people that are suffering from sanctions are Kim family and his elite. The rest of majority of people will suffer no matter how much sanction you will take out from Kim. He never invest for his people.

TITLE: President Trump abruptly yanks sanctions on North Korea because he 'likes' dictator Kim Jong Un

COMMENTS:
>"It was announced today by the U.S. Treasury that additional large scale Sanctions would be added to those already existing Sanctions on North Korea," Trump posted on Twitter. "I have today ordered the withdrawal of those additional Sanctions!"

>It was not immediately clear which sanctions Trump was referring to and White House officials did not respond to questions seeking clarity. 

>“**President Trump likes Chairman Kim and he doesn’t think these sanctions will be necessary**,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. 

This is absurd....
---
Because he puts the feelings for his infatuation ahead of his Oath Of Office and our country.
---
Who said I was powerless and insignificant.  Are you projecting again?  I don't feel that way at all, and I can tell from looking at my life so far that I am not.  

I would never want to be like Trump or anyone in his circle.  I would never want to be anything like Hilary and Bill Clinton for the same reason.   I think all the money Trump loves and the power he craves have turned him into an inhuman monster.  He's a second generation of this particular world view, so his disease is actually much worse than Bill and Hilary who had to aspire to and achieve their money and power on their own, instead of having their parents do it for them.  So, their behaviors are more within the bounds of human decency.  I hope for her sake Chelsea can avoid the pitfall of the second generation of 'rich and powerful' families.  I don't know enough about her to decide, and am not interested enough to learn more.  

It seems to me that people who are deluded about the reality of money and power have abdicated their responsibilities to the rest of the world and think that somehow they 'deserve' whatever they can take away from others. It would just be sad if they didn't manage to wrest power from the people all the time because their mental illness is somehow made sacred by Capitalism.  

And it is a very ignorant statement to imply that only Trump or Rich and Powerful Assholes have any power and influence in the world.  I understand, then, why you revere and defend his behavior:  you are also a lost soul who believes in 'money and power'.  But, as a result, you have a very limited understanding of the rest of the world, which you have exhibited with that statement, in my opinion.

---
How many times must he *appear* incompetent before we can just agree that he *is* incompetent?
---
I accept that I just don't understand this person, but why in the world would you tweet about all of this and not just make a few calls to quietly straighten it out? It's his administration after all. He looks like the last to know by tweeting about it.  It appears rather incompetent.
---
>why in the world would you tweet about all of this and not just make a few calls to quietly straighten it out?

It's baffling isn't it?

* He's incredibly lazy and tweeting is easier than calling, assuming he could remember who to even call 

* He has no attention span for listening to reports of what is going on, like new sanctions being enacted.

* Fox & Friends probably accused the deep state of taking this action

* He's a malignant narcissist, and wants the attention that tweeing gives him

* Putin told him to

Or some combination of the above, or something else entirely.  Trying to divine Trump's motives in doing something is probably bad for your mental health.

TITLE: President Trump abruptly cancels U.S. sanctions on North Korea because he ‘likes’ Kim Jong Un

COMMENTS:
Trump likes: violent despots, groping women, child concentration camps, Steve Doocy, playing the victim, racist dog whistles, rallies, Twitter, chaos.

Trump dislikes: any form criticism, American war heroes, people of color, allies of the United States, things Trump previously said, rule of law, SNL, 99% of journalism, anyone who didn't vote for him, accountability, conflicting information.

I'm sure I missed some.
---
Dogs. He doesn't like puppies.

This isn't sarcasm.

I'm being serious.

I also can't find a single clip or mention of Trump ever really laughing hard.

I can find clips of almost every President wiping away tears they are laughing so hard.

Not Trump. Not even Apprentice out-takes. A TV show he was on for *years.*
---
....because he want to distract from the impending Mueller report.  Prepare for a lot of these stunts in the coming days.
---
We need to stop Trump from making decisions until we can figure out what the HELL is going on!

TITLE: Trump reverses first North Korea sanctions since failed summit after one day

COMMENTS:
I absolutely don’t get it. Trump had to been involved in discussions about the new sanctions.
Then after implementing them, the next day his dumb ass tweet’s foreign policy: 

“I have today ordered the withdrawal of those additional Sanctions!”

I’m truly dumbfounded. Maybe he really needs to cut back on his executive time and focus for a few fucking minutes on what is happening in place of tweeting about John McCain.

I think he got a phone call from his handler.

This is astonishing and fucking bewildering.
---
Trump reeks of desperation. He gave Kim two summits with nothing to show for it, and now he's lifting sanctions on the hope that he'll get a Nobel Peace Prize out of it. I am confounded by anyone who looks at this pathetic display and see diplomatic brilliance.
---
It's highly likely that the Russians and Saudis have something on him but now it looks like NK may have something on him. How else can anyone explain the deferential treatment Trump has bestowed on a murderous dictatorship?

All that winning...for North Korea. For South Korea, Japan, and the U.S.? Not so much.

>	Can’t tell if kompromat or he is trying to distract us

I’d assumed he was bribed and he figured this would also make for a good diversion. I guess the bribe can count as kompromat now as well.
---
It is kind of strange the only countries he seems to do business with could give the impression he is compromised. 

I can’t tell if the legit countries just won’t go anywhere near him, which is totally possible. There has to be an easy deal to be had somewhere but I’m guessing those leaders want nothing to do with this guy. 

Or if he is doing putins bidding. No matter how crazy it sounds it just can’t be ruled out.

What? Why? They just quit South Korea Liaison office without any explanation. Russia is still supplying fuel to NK despite all sanctions. Fuck trump, blatant treason right in front of us. He is only good for two things, sucking gay clown putin’s dick and endorsement of division & acceptance of nazis

It was inevitable. 

Instead of dealing with our cultural monsters we just swept them under the rug. We deserve what we get because we never took the time to fully disinfect ourselves. 

Everytime politicians "played nice" and pandered to "economic anxiety", we added a teaspoon to the mountainous demise of our democracy.

Trump is what happens when a fashion model with a promising career realizes she's at rock-bottom, doing lines of coke off the bathroom floor of a seedy motel. 

Trump isn't the reflection, he's the mirror in the bathroom showing us what we've become. It hurts to look at for a while, and I'm sure we'll swear up and down that it's not ourselves we see in that reflection.

It is. It's all of us. And unless we work together to fix it, we'll stay on that floor snorting media and celebrity while we dance toward the grave.

So, let me get this straight, we put on new sanctions, and Trump just removed them on a whim, is that what is going on?  This guy's elevator does not go to the top.

TITLE: Trump says he is withdrawing earlier North Korea-related sanctions

COMMENTS:
>It was not immediately clear what sanctions Trump was referring to, although the United States on Thursday blacklisted two Chinese shipping companies that it said helped North Korea evade sanctions over its nuclear weapons program.

This is so insane that the media isn't actually sure it's really what happened, but [Trump's tweet seems pretty clear](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1109143448634966020) that yes, he is really announcing a withdrawal of sanctions that were just announced, before anyone even knew what they were:

>"It **was announced today** by the U.S. Treasury that additional large scale Sanctions would be added to those already existing Sanctions on North Korea. I **have today ordered** the withdrawal of those additional Sanctions!"

Well oiled machine.

Edit - [An explanation from Sarah Huckabee Sanders](https://twitter.com/BennettJohnT/status/1109150246909734912):

>“President Trump likes Chairman Kim and he doesn’t think these sanctions will be necessary.”

Cool, so I guess the US is rewarding them for spinning back up their missile and nuclear testing facilities.

Cool. Cool cool, cool cool cool cool. Cool.

AKA he realized he's messed up and is trying to backtrack like it never happened.  

This was probably realized when the north  just pulled out of the liaison center with South Korea and torpedoed the work the SK president has done.

He overplayed his hand big time.
---
And if you ask the people at TD they’ll tell you that the summits literally achieved world peace. This is not an exaggeration.

Nothing new here.  They've done this kind of signaling more times, for as far back as anyone can remember, than you can shake a stick at.

They do something we don't like; we respond with something they don't like; on and on it goes.  The *only* thing different about this (which is inconsequential to the actual situation) is dumbass Trump convincing idiots that the DPRK was going to work with us in good faith.

Evangelicals will believe what their "faith" tells them to, and consider it a virtue to believe something that defies all reason logic and factual evidence - because the more irrational their belief, the better it shows the strength of their "faith".  In other words, they consider anti-intellectualism a virtue.

Planned Parenthood DECREASES abortions, but Evangelicals want to defund it.  Christianity explicitly considers excessive wealth to be a moral failing, yet they worship Prosperity Gospel.

If one had created this scenario as satire or comedy a few years ago, it would have been considered too over the top ridiculous/absurd, or a kind of fear-mongering or grossly oversimplified Evangelical-bashing.  But here we are.

Evangelicals are head-over-heels worshiping an adulterous pathological cheater and liar, who by no stretch of the imagination can one consider a Christian - has never set foot in his "church" yet evangelical "leaders" form prayer circles around him as if he's somehow God's Gift.

It's The Handmaid's Tale and Idiocracy rolled into one.
---
They are actively trying to bring about the apocalypse.  It's a death cult.  It's the only reason they support Israel, and part of the reason that they don't care about climate change or science in general.  In their view, it's all moot, because they will bring about the end times.
---
Well said. Much like dinosaur bones, negative facts about The Donald exist simply to "test" their absolute faith.  Make no mistake, this sort of deliberate departure from reason is absolutely an existential threat to the continued existence of man.

> Two U.S. senators sought to dial up pressure on North Korea on Tuesday by reintroducing a bill to impose sanctions on any bank that does business with its government, with the endorsement of the parents of Otto Warmbier, a U.S. college student who died after being imprisoned by Pyongyang.

> Republican Senator Pat Toomey and Democrat Chris Van Hollen offered the “Otto Warmbier Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea (BRINK) Act” days after a summit between Republican President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was abruptly cut off after they failed to reach a deal for the reclusive communist nation to give up its nuclear weapons.

If North Korea complies, they lose any chance at all from defending themselves. Russia has expressed interest in the past at gaining access to the China Sea via Korea. A denuclearized North Korea makes them impotent to the invasion.

It's easier when you don't consider everything.

How about just complying and get all the sanctions removed. This is one reason I don't get Washington these days, besides the Russian puppet president. Don't budge with these fuckers, when they ask for relief that's when you got them and you should squeeze more. No, sanctions should be lifted when you follow all the rules.

TITLE: New North Korea Concerns Flare as Trump’s Signature Diplomacy Wilts

COMMENTS:
WASHINGTON — North Korea launched short-range ballistic missiles on Thursday for the second time in a week, prompting President Trump to acknowledge that “nobody’s happy” about the implications for his diplomatic effort to denuclearize the country.

Hours before the president’s comments, the United States said it had seized a North Korean ship that was flouting sanctions by carrying banned exports of coal. Meanwhile, a research group revealed a huge, years-old base that appears to have been designed to hide and protect the North’s growing arsenal of long-range missiles.

The menacing signals from both sides were further evidence that Mr. Trump, less than a year into his initiative to deal one on one with a North Korean autocrat, has run headlong into the roadblocks that doomed the efforts of his four immediate predecessors.

The diplomatic setback comes amid Mr. Trump’s tense argument over trade with China — the country he needs most to rein in Kim Jong-un, the North’s leader — and as the United States appears to be veering toward a deeper confrontation with Iran.

Wilts, goes limp, is flaccid. Classic Trump!

This cannot be true!  I have been authoritatively informed by Trump supporters that Trump was on the verge of winning a Nobel Prize for single-handedly denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula!

Well, either that or he's an idiot who thinks he knows more about diplomacy than our top diplomats despite zero experience and wound up giving up major concessions in his talks with DRPK and got literally nothing in return.

Putin ordered Trump to scrap it and he obeyed.

Because of course Trump would be willing to not only fail to reach a deal, let alone a definition on what "denuclearization" means; but also somehow unilaterally give into his new BFF Kim....Jong.... Un without them having to sacrifice a damn thing. Fucking pathetic, broke, tiny mushroom dick, little treasonous bitch. I cannot think of a single iota where he has done anything patriotic let alone taken one step in the interest of our country.

TITLE: Fact check: Trump is wrong that soldiers' remains are still 'coming back' from North Korea

COMMENTS:
Not wrong. He's straight up LYING.
---
> The Pentagon's Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in May that no more remains would be coming back this fiscal year. The agency said North Korea had not spoken with the agency at all since the Hanoi summit in February between Trump and Kim Jong Un, which ended abruptly.
> 
> The official announcement that the remains program has been frozen has not stopped Trump from wrongly claiming that the remains continue to be returned. He also made the present-tense claim in a May 27 press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ("We, as you know, are getting the remains -- continuing to get the remains"), a June 11 exchange with reporters ("The remains keep coming back"), and a June 12 press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda ("We're getting the remains back").
---
Lies... LIes.....LIEs.....LIES!
---
Not the first time he’s lied about this

>	“The soldiers that died in Korea, their remains are going to be coming back home,” he told Fox News aboard Air Force One.

>	“And we have **thousands of people that have asked for that, thousands and thousands of people.** So many people asked when I was on the campaign, I’d say ‘Wait a minute, I don’t have any relationship…’, but they said, ‘When you can President, **we’d love our son to be brought back home’**. You know the remains.

>	The comments shocked viewers, who pointed out **any parents still alive to make the request of Mr Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign would have been at least in their late 90s, and more likely well over a hundred.** The Korean War armistice was signed in 1953.

Remember when an American Citizen was tortured and killed by a country we are still technically at War with and Trump said this during his State of the Union:

>"You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all," Trump said, addressing Warmbier's parents, during his 2018 State of the Union address. "Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto's memory with American resolve." He added in that same speech: "We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and our allies."


Then later said this:
>Fast forward to Thursday in Hanoi, when, at a summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, Trump said this of Warmbier and North Korea: "He tells me that he didn't know about it and I will take him at his word." Trump added that Kim "felt badly about it. He felt very badly."

COMMENTS:
This is the lens with wich he sees the world. He doesn't look at NK as a place where people are suffering, he views it as a place where potential real estate value is being squandered.

It's not a bad thing to want to improve an impovershed country's economy, but you can't do that when you are sympathetic to a despot that is the cause of all the country's problems. 

And that, my friends, is the rub. Helping the people of NK requires Kim's removal. Building a hotel there does not.

Of course: people below his standing (i.e. not super-rich or world's tyrants) are losers and don't matter. He only needs to keep enough of them bamboozled.

TITLE: No One Seems to Agree With Donald Trump That North Korea Missile Tests Did Not Violate U.N. Resolutions

COMMENTS:
>The apparent chaos at the top of America's foreign policy apparatus came into sharp focus again on Wednesday, as the State Department undermined President Donald Trump’s controversial defense of recent North Korean weapons tests.  
>  
>The two short-range missile tests conducted earlier this month come amid stalled negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang on sanctions relief and denuclearization on the Korean peninsula. Combined with the seizure of a [North Korean tanker](https://www.newsweek.com/north-korea-sanctions-coal-tanker-negotiations-nuclear-weapons-1433630) suspected of violating international sanctions on the secretive state, these developments have undermined improving relations between the two historic adversaries.  
>  
>Speaking during last weekend’s state visit to Japan, Trump was asked whether he was bothered by the missile tests conducted by North Korea. “No, I'm not. I am personally not,” he replied. The president added that he was “very happy” with progress on North Korea, despite the collapse in talks.  
>  
>Trump also said he did not believe the missile tests violated a United Nations resolution—passed in 2006 and reinforced by a second in 2009—imposing sanctions on North Korea and demanding the nation “not conduct any further nuclear test or launch of a ballistic missile.”  
>  
>The president said that while his “people think it could have been a violation…I view it differently.”  
>  
>This language was echoed by Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo on Monday at the same press conference in which [Trump dismissed the significance of the tests](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-shinzo-abe-north-korea-weapons-tests-contradicted-kim-jong-un-1436954). Abe described the launches as “of great regret” and suggested they had in fact breached U.N. guidance.  
>  
>Asked to clarify the department’s stance, spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said, “I think the entire North Korean \[weapons of mass destruction\] program, it’s in conflict with the U.N. Security Council resolutions.  
>  
>Harry Kazianis, the senior director of Korean studies at the Center for the National Interest, agreed there is “no doubt whatsoever that North Korea violated UN Security Council resolutions when it tested short-range missiles recently.”

&#x200B;

That's because they did violate UN Security Counsel resolutions but Trump as always is at odds with the TRUTH, political wins are far more appropriate than facing reality or even achieving actual progress.
---
That's because Trump lied, for some (x) reason and praised our advisories above our own country's  interests.
---
Because almost none of the world takes Trump seriously including North Korea.
---
As though trump was even partially familiar with what the U.N. resolutions say.

If there is someone I wouldn't mind being next in Trump's tireless chopping block, that's Bolton. For someone who supposedly was so greatly at odds with the Bushes and their hawkish interventionism, it was odd to see him hire their most unhinged ideologe. But since Trump is seeking advice on the matter with none other than Sheldon Adelson, one gets the feeling that nothing good will come of all of this.

I don't understand why more people don't have a problem with this. Obama bowed to Minster Abe way back when (which is, you know, *a sign of respect to the Japanese, especially when* they *were the host country*) and Republicans lost their shit.

Remember Helsinki? And the backlash that *didn't* happen from Republicans? And when Trump claimed he "misspoke" *almost a full week after the fact?* Where were Republicans then?

Self-righteous, corrupt, hypocritical knobs, the lot of them.

Alone on North Korea, alone on Iran!  Iran showed North Korea that if they keep their word, Trump will betray them.  

Nk showed Iran that Trump will do what Trump does regardless of how you act, so better to just do your own thing.

COMMENTS:
This is a good example of how harmful willful ignorance is.

Looking at his past meetings with Kim, there is little evidence to indicate that  NK will change their policies.  And yet, Trump believes that Kim will.  He is willfully ignorance the actual evidence, and hoping things will be different.

We deserve far more from a leader.
---
But he’s not a leader, he’s a dictator. Unfortunately...
---
This is Trumpism.

Decide what you want to believe, then use conspiracy thinking to view everything as supporting your belief.  If it doesn't appear to support your belief, it's evidence of the nefariousness of your opponents, hiding how it supports your belief.

Everyone who can think rationally is the enemy, so blinded by their hatred of Trump, they can't see what you see.

I don't know if it works without such a uniquely shitty person as Trump at the helm.

It's weaponized stupidity.

He thinks it's impressive.

He genuinely thinks it is impressive that the most despicable war criminal on the face of the earth smiled at him.

Wasn't he going to fire and fury them all if they tested anymore missiles?

Why does he have such confidence in dictator Kim and why doesn’t he know how to spell the name Biden?
---
Calls someone low IQ IMMEDIATELY AFTER MISSPELLING THEIR NAME
---
Because Kim knows exactly how to sweet talk him.

Watch, Kim will be making reelection ads for him.

After all it went from no nukes, to no testing, to now, Kim is keeping all his promises to me personally (by flattering him publicly).

It's crazy how in love Republicans in general are with Kim Jong Un now.

Even my family have pictures of him and Trump everywhere.

I'm not even joking.

If he was trying to send you some sort of "signal", I'm sure he appreciates you blabbing about it on twitter.

Of course they are. They have Donnie wrapped around their fingers. Why would they want anyone else?

Good thing Russia and North Korea don't choose our president.
---
Stupid people will call other people dumb, it's a defense mechanism.
---
Passive? No that is not the word. Something more like a complete and utter bumbling of the entire thing.

We gave up military exercises and got nothing in return. This  weeks after Donnie said he was going to blow them off the map. **He got nothing.** They made a fool out of him. 

And no that was not Obama's strategy. All past presidents refuse to even negotiate with such a brutal dictator that was committing horrible atrocities. They have to show some progress of change before they would  even consider negotiations. None has occurred and still haven't. 

Instead Donnie said he was a great guy. All it took was a giant over-sized  card Kim-Jong-un sent him  and Donnie melted. They have now restarted their nuclear weapons program.

Thing about Iran though is that Iran's leadership will never play kiss ass with Trump the way that Kim Jong Un did, and there is no country like China, South Korea, or Japan that urged them to come together. Saudi Arabia and Israel are both actively trying to get the US to deal with their biggest enemy in the region, so our soldiers can bleed for them and take the world's condemnation.

Does that matter? It's a slap in the face to the American people and just another reason for North Korea to hate America. His response comes from twitter, then he immediately redirects to Obama. Sounds like a diversion to me. North Korea demanded we sign the "bill" before he was released. His negotiation skills are agreeing and then stalling until we forget about it.

So he bragged about 3 live hostages, 1 dead hostage, no missile testing and getting the war dead back.

We are now only down to him bragging about 3 hostages that were arrested during his own term.

Kim Jong Un, obviously, doesn't understand Trumps "strength."

Don't forget he approved a payment of $2 Million for Otto Warmbier's "hospital bills". Even if he didn't send the funds. He's a weak man who gets on his knees for any authoritarian, it's sickening.

Can you imagine what FOX and republicans would be doing if Obama had done this?  It would be apocalyptic.   Every news station would be covering this as the most massive scandal in decades.  CNN would have 24/7 coverage on "Korea-gate" and special prosecutors would be assigned by the end of the day.  Articles of impeachment would be approved within hours.  

But Trump does it and Republicans ignore or applaud his negotiation skills.  Democrats yawn and make a luke-warm response about being disappointed.  The cable news programs put the article up on the front page, but by the end of they day are covering Trump's latest tweet.

Kim Jung un and Putin are playing Trump like a goddamn fiddle..... It's embarrassing.

Trump agreeing to pay, but not following through. NK must've not go the memo on the deadbeat US president.
---
So random employees in this administration can just sign documents giving $2 million to an enemy dictatorship, and Trump isn't aware of it?  How incompetent, and troubling.

No answer?  Can't reply.  Logic is your enemy.
---
>Did he personally sign it?
>
>> Speaking to "Fox News Sunday," Bolton confirmed that a Trump administration official signed a document agreeing to pay $2 million towards the medical care and release of Warmbier, who fell into a coma while in North Korean custody
>
>The answer is no he didn’t.

North Korea arrested Otto allegedly on false pretenses, forced him to tearfully and hysterically apologize on live tv,  tortured him so badly they left him braindead then carted his vegetable body to the exchange without telling Trump administration that Otto was in life support. 

And Trump said, yeah we'll pay you for doing that to him. Here it is in writing. lol 

All that on top of his promise to make hundreds of Kate Steineles by shipping all immigrants to sanctuary cities. We can only hope that will end up chasing out all conservatives left in those cities. 

And you fully support this!
---
So why did Kim say he didn't know of Warmbier's condition if there was a 2 million dollar bill for his care? And if there was a medical bill and Trump knew about it, why did he say he believed Kim didn't know? This makes no sense.

This is the definition that best fits this situation 

>My experience is that someone who exhibits this form of behavior is setting up a swindle of some kind. The goal is to be confident until people are confident in you in order to swindle. It fits the first definition of con artist. Synonymous is confidence man, and con is short for confidence as the goal of the confidence man is to exhibit an aura of confidence and trust around him on a venture which relies on trust.

How can anyone seriously defend Donald Trump and his band of idiots?  Honestly, how brainwashed and conditioned does one have to be to abandon logic and reason to support a degenerate like Trump?  Are those lemmings degenerates themselves?
---
This is legit Bizzaro world shit. 

“The President of the United States sides with North Korean Dictator over his own intelligence agencies”

WTF
---
Anyone who doesn’t worship him or flatter him is the enemy. It doesn’t matter if you’re Justin Amash or Nancy Pelosi, he sees you as anti-American, because he views America as his property. So if a murderous thug of a dictator flatters him, he holds him in higher esteem than a dedicated congressman or woman who criticizes him.

Way to go Republicans, for gifting us with this man child nightmare.

The lemming thing is a myth, most widely perpetuated by a Disney nature documentary in which many, many lemmings were thrown to their deaths.

They do migrate or spread out when there are too many in an area which sometimes involves jumping into and swimming across bodies of water, and some may accidentally die on the way, but they won’t purposefully kill themselves or follow others to their own detriment.

That is to say, Trump’s followers are less intelligent than a pack of wild rodents.

TITLE: Trump suggests that Kim Jong Un's mockery of Joe Biden is a positive signal for North Korean relationship

COMMENTS:
There is so much wrong with this. He has confused the nation and treaties of the USA with himself and his political fortunes, at a very fundamental level

He is a foolish old man who is incapable of doing much on his own. His family has low IQ. But, he is growing more dangerous each month as people realize they can get their own agendas met using him. As long as they can show him a profit line, they are all set

This should not be confused with the GOP using their advantage in the senate to wreck the courts. That is separate. Trump's danger is that our nation has an overpopulation of smart criminals who are ruthless. And while many are not engaging with him at this time, because they see him as a joke and imbecile. Should he win re-election many will change their minds. And our country will never recover

Trump put too much of his "deal making" reputation at stake with North Korea. He went to the summits unprepared, made a bunch of gaffs, and then called the problem solved. When it became apparent that problem was not solved, he tried to claim a minor victory that there were not missile tests, Now that that's untrue he's trying to play it off as no big deal. 

North Korea has been playing the same game for decades, President Trump is just the first leader stupid enough to fall for it.

Hey GOP, your country and the world are kind of waiting for you guys to stand up and denounce this dangerous buffoon. Anytime now would be good.

We’re all so numb to Trump’s bullshit that I don’t think we can appreciate how truly insane this is. The President of the United States of America is brushing off missile tests by a rogue, nuclear armed nation because of his (likely imaginary) personal relationship with their murderous dictator. He is also making some unclear comment about that dictator’s feelings on our last Vice President, but I can’t figure out what the fuck that is. Jesus Christ I just want this all to be over so badly.

>The United States has seized a North Korean cargo ship, alleging sanctions violations by the country, the Justice Department said Thursday.

>The seizure is likely to heighten tensions between the two countries at a time when US efforts to dissuade North Korea from pursuing its nuclear weapons program have stalled following the failure of the Hanoi summit in February.

>The ship, the M/V Wise Honest, was "used to illicitly ship coal from North Korea and to deliver heavy machinery to the (Democratic People's Republic of Korea)," the Justice Department said, alleging that "payments for maintenance, equipment, and improvements of the Wise Honest were made in US dollars through unwitting US banks.

>"This conduct violates longstanding US law and United Nations Security Council resolutions," the Justice Department said.

Trump doesn’t even realize how dumb he really is. At least George W.

Trump is like a toddler sitting in front of a stacked monopoly board. Shit is flying everywhere and the mess will have to be cleaned up by the adults when all is said and done. No matter how well we clean up after this, we will still be stepping on random pieces causing lots of pain for years to come.

TITLE: After Madrid Embassy Raid, North Korean Defector Group Vows More Action

COMMENTS:
This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.npr.org/2019/04/02/708718922/after-madrid-embassy-raid-north-korean-defector-group-vows-more-action) reduced by 85%. (I'm a bot)
*****
> After Madrid Embassy Raid, North Korean Defector Group Vows More Action The group&#039;s leader is &quot;Less like the leader of a civic group, and more like a soldier on a battlefield, bold and combative,&quot; says a defector who has worked with him.

> Normally, says Sung-Yoon Lee, a Korean studies expert at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, North Korea would be loath to mention anything at all that might puncture &quot;The myth of invincible, unassailable, infallible, omnipotent leadership.&quot; But these days, too much information is flowing into North Korea for its government to keep the Madrid embassy incident a secret.

> The raid on the Madrid embassy has fired up North Korean defector groups in South Korea, none of whom have yet dared to call for armed resistance against Pyongyang.

TITLE: Activity At 2nd North Korean Missile Site Indicates Possible Launch Preparations

COMMENTS:
Im tired of "winning"
---
For anyone confused like I was, these images are taken from a different site than was mentioned a few days ago. So TWO sites now look to be possibly setting up to launch missiles—not just one.
---
Nobel Prize!
---
This is North Korea “negotiating.” Their only leverage is aggression, and the possibility of violence. Trump walked away. They’re projecting to Trump that the “victory” he’d secured before that halted missile testing was revocable and has been. We’re back to where Trump started, except now Kim is being treated as an equal on the global stage, and Kim’s people see him as stronger than Trump, and by extension America. Everybody lost a bit in this negotiating except Kim. This is why no previous administration has taken this approach.
---
It's like telling someone that 2×2 and 2+2 equal the same over and over yet having them deny it and even try to convince you otherwise. But now that they've solved the equation are claiming they knew the answer all along.

North Korea has always pulled this shit and they aren't going to stop. All Trump has done is give them the prestige of a presidential meeting, stopped military exercises with South Korea, and made it harder for us to work with China.

---
Did you hear that North Korea is showing a movie that was just made, showing what a fool they made of Trump?
---
yah in other words, trump has given up all other commitments to the point where the only thing left is launching a nuke into space.  Not to worry though, he will give that up too eventually.

Nevermind the fact that they have nukes at all now and continue to launch tests all over the damn ocean and over our own state of hawaii.  nevermind the fact that we have ceased war games around their country.  Nevermind all other concessions trump has given to show how weak he is.

trump is a laughing stock.  Kim has outsmartted him time and time again.  He even saluted a north korean general, 100% legitimizing their joke military.  Lets not forget that.

&nbsp;



Oh my god would it kill you to just support our fucking allies?
---
It's not even support. By doing this he's actively undermining both Japan and South Korea. Great job, Trump.
---
Exactly. Support is the bare minimum. He can't even manage that. And people wonder why everyone thinks he's in bed with Putin; he seems to take every step possible to undermine and destabilize both peace and our standing on the world stage.
---
It's because he's an idiot. Like most things in Trump's current life, he neither understands the depth nor breadth of his position. He cannot fathom the importance of NK's missile tests or their affect on the world. He simply lacks the mental capacity to understand. He's the Dunning Kruger president with a frothing, Dunning Kruger base.

Can't we just say "falsely" instead of "bizarrely"? 

It's obvious he's lying. It's getting tiring that the media is helping him out so much.

I hope going forward the GOP are never allowed to forget the kind of BS they let slip by for Trump.

They'll deny it, say they weren't ever supporting him, then blame the democrats.

TITLE: Is it actually in United States overall interests in Asian region to solve North Korean problem?

POST: I was just thinking today that one of the main things that justifies US military presence so near Chinese borders is North Korea. In a scenario in which North Korea is no longer a threat, US really has no justification to keep large amounts of military in the region, other than to protect its allies like Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Also I think that as long as North Korean threat exists, it is also in Chinese interests to have forces in the region that can keep North Korea in check. Once North Korea no longer becomes an actual threat to US, I think it will largely legitimize Chinese calls for US withdrawal from the region and US leadership will have hard time to justify the current, large-scale deployment, wargames, and the financial burden to its electorate.

Is my thinking about this situation flawed? I would like to read some opinions about this, feel free to disagree with me, I am by no means anything close to an expert of the situation.

POST: With recent summits and meetings between North Korean leadership and the rest of the world, what is the chance that North Korea will unilaterally destroy their nuclear weapons? Based on my understanding of the North Korean view, they are looking for a mutual agreement denuclearize the Korean peninsula (including South Korea), which seems like a non-starter for the USA.  


What kinds of concessions can realistically be expected from a nuclear armed state in this kind of situation?

POST: Pre 2018, war with North Korea and it’s collapse seemed like an inevitability. Tensions were at boiling point and the world was anxious about what the DPRK will do next.

However in 2018, the world breathed a sigh of relief, as the tensions relaxed and North Korea had diplomatic talks with both South Korea and their greatest enemy; America. Since then we haven’t really heard much about North Korea compared to what we have seen throughout the rest of the 2010s.

What will it be like for them going into the future? Will they maintain this detent with SK and the West? Will they liberalise? How are they going to cope with the rapid technological change the world will see in the coming decades?

TITLE: Why the US does not want North Korea and Iran to have nukes

POST: North Korea and Iran are on the news for their nuclear ambitions. Iran is on the way to having the capability and North Korea is on its way to have a working ICBM. It is cited they are they using it for deterence, to prevent their nation from collapse by an outside power. Critics of US policy has cited nuclear weapons are for defense against the US, and the US has nothing to worry about.

However, the US has constantly provoked North Korea and the tensions got so high it almost amounted to war. Why is this? Why does the US fear third rate powers with nukes? The answer is it defeats the Flexible Response doctrine of the US. Typically US military is there to counter top powers like the Soviet Union. The US uses a system called "Flexible Response" to counter both nuclear and conventional threats. It also suscribes to "proportional respond" to defend its allies. If the enemy uses conventional forces, the reponse is conventional response back, if nukes the US will use nukes.

Take US v China on Taiwan. If US does get in a war where China is using conventional weapons, US could win(likely) with its 10 carriers, thousands of fighters, nuclear submarines and better tech. If China were tip to scale using tactical nuclear weapons, US could respond by hitting non-city Chinese targets, with its more warheads. US has more missile defenses, more carriers that can hide and move, and intel assets, so even in a non-city nuclear war US could come out of top with both sides bloodied. A total strategic nuclear war, it would be Mutually Assured Destructuction, but I doubt China will give its cities for Taiwan.

Now this is the doctrine against a power like China or Russia. But enter North Korea with an ICBM and everything changes. North Korea is just as capable of defeating US static targets like military bases in Asia with its medium range nuclear missile force. Without ICBMs with answer was easy, take out North Korea completly(including city targets with nukes or overwhelming conventional superiority). However with an ICBM, North Korea could destroy US cities. With an ICBM, North Korea using its medium range missile destroying major US bases will cripple US capability on the Pacific and the US would be limited to restrained retaliation. US can't destroy Pyongyang and topple the regime without getting LA and New York getting nuked. It could nuke the North Korean military bases, but that won't topple the regime, just contain North Korea and beat back its military from taking the South. US military would still be bloodied after a Phyric victory, used a lot of its nukes on a rather insignifcant nation...and now China is possibly much stronger and could be possibly on parity with US capability.

&#x200B;

This is why US doesn't want such a insignificant power to get nukes. It is very imbalance of power. So why would North Korea risk such a move? Well in the US mind, beligerents are not rational, and would take huge risks even with a high chance of losing.(Japan, Germany, Saddam etc). North Korea may use its nukes to say "give up South Korea or your Pacific military will be crippled by nukes". Just like how Saddam planned to US surrender by fighting a bloody battle where the US civilian populace would give up(it didn't happen thanks to US conventional superiority)

So what could the US do? Well the answer now is Missile Defense. The problem is that it is not a 100 percent defense, but it may be able to save major military bases against the Medium range threat,(ie. THAAD)while new interepotrs in Alaska can stop the ICBM threat. North Korea doesn't have a working ICBM yet, hopefully US tests would be make Missile Defense good enough in time. US would be putting Missile Defense in Europe to defend against Russia. However, Iran has no ICBM yet, so that is less of a threat.

USA TODAY [traveled to Ukraine in early October](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/world/2019/10/10/trumps-biden-ukraine-natural-gas-conspiracy-theory-false-but-alive/3851728002/) to try to understand the source of President Donald Trump’s allegations against Joe and Hunter Biden, and also other claims of U.S. election meddling by Ukraine.

TITLE: John Bolton, North Korea, and the Trump White House's Successes and Failures

POST: [In an exclusive interview](https://www.axios.com/bolton-john-trump-north-korea-missiles-94088bf9-4d2d-4d10-bfd9-80db7bc36a50.html), former U.S. National Security  Advisor John Bolton told Axios that the Trump Administration should admit its approach to end North Korea’s nuclear arms program has “failed.” Bolton suggested the Trump administration is "bluffing" about stopping North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and it would be “very unusual” for this White House to say that they were wrong.

John Bolton, though, is an interesting figure himself to say the least. Bloomberg, [in their piece on how Bolton's departure could impact the President's foreign policy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-11/john-bolton-trump-foreign-policy), described Bolton as "the most vocal hardliner [in] President Donald Trump's inner circle." Bolton's departure has also been met by favorable and affirmative statements from other government, [including that of North Korea](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-20/north-korea-praises-trump-for-ousting-troublemaker-bolton). Foreign Policy magazine went so far as to [analogize](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/01/john-bolton-is-ready-to-go-rogue/) the Trump-Bolton relationship with the tumultuous Reagan-Haig relationship of the 1980s. If that were the case, I'd imagine Mr. Bolton would love to criticize Mr. Trump regardless of how effectively the White House operates.

That being said, Kim Jong Un has been presenting himself to be very tough recently. Earlier this month [he inspected](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/kim-jong-un-is-back-on-his-white-horse-as-north-korea-flags-a-big-decision/2019/12/03/7bbc9b2a-163c-11ea-80d6-d0ca7007273f_story.html) "revolutionary battle sites" around Mount Paektu, and [warned Washington](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/north-korea-warns-united-states-of-an-unwelcome-christmas-gift/2019/12/03/ad406634-1599-11ea-80d6-d0ca7007273f_story.html) that it could soon receive an "unwelcome Christmas gift," calling us all back to remember [the last thing](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/05/asia/north-korea-missile-nuclear-gift/index.html) North Korea described as a "gift." I'm no deterrence theorist, but that seems a bit like bolstering reputation and interest.

So, what are we supposed to believe. Is John Bolton right in saying the Trump White House is failing in North Korea, or is John Bolton merely criticizing an ex-employer? More specifically, could you give me any insights on: 

 - **What successes (and failures) has the Trump Administration seen in its relations with North Korea;**
 - **Are those successes (and failures) significant compared to the successes of other Presidencies;**
 - **Can those successes be maintained (or those failures undone) by this Administration, or are they fleeting, and;** 
 - **Is it reasonable to believe that another specific strategy is definitively more likely to bring about more success (or less failure)?**

Edit: removed an erroneous ")"
