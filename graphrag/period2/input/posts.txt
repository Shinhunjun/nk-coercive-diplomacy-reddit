TITLE: US forces to remain in South Korea regardless of peace treaty, Kim's Top Aide says.

COMMENTS:
>My line of thought is that a war against NK has to be justified somehow. If the world believes NK is on the right track, how would one justify a war against it?  
>  
>Not really a "security guarantee", but if NK is honest and serious about rapprochement with the south and doesn't act aggressive, is there really a military threat anymore at all?

Muammar Gaddafi became a model dictator to the international community following his nuclear concessions. He had relations with many Western states, including the US, and cooperated on targeting terrorists and enemies of the Gaddafi regime. This all turned on a dime when the scent of revolution hit the air. What is stopping the same thing happening to Kim Jong-un?
---
If this statement is accurate, I really wonder what NK is getting in terms of a security guarantee? Nuclear weapons were the only way they could credibly deter the US in the event of a resumed conflict by themselves.

I'm guessing a Chinese and/or Russian security guarantee? But even then, NK would have to be pretty aware of the possibility of being thrown to the wolves by those countries for their own benefit.
---
I don't see why they would ever give up their nukes.
---
The article is in Korean. Just published a few hours ago. According to the article, Kim Yong-chol, NK's spy chief told Donald Trump that North Korea will never mention or discuss the withdrawal of US forces in Korea even after a formal peace treaty. The information has been shared with South Korean officials. A big progress indeed.

I don't see why they would either, unless there's a fundamental realignment underway that we're simply not privy to.

TITLE: Can an ICBM armed North Korea "win" a war against US and South Korea?

POST: How dangerous is an ICBM armed North Korea? The worse case scenario is if they use their short ranged and medium range missiles to rain hell on South Korea, and we have no way to respond strategically. They can effectively invade South Korea. Of course US troops can use employ tactical nuclear weapons to beat by NK's armies and score a military victory, however the destruction of NK's cities and deposal of the Kim regime will likely result in North Korea launching their ICBM to hit major US cities in retaliation.   


North Korea's missiles are mobile based so they are very hard to take out all of them in a first strike, unlike silo based missiles. The US could use missile defense systems like THAAD, AEGIS, along with the Ground Based Interceptor in Alaska and California to score a victory however they are not 100 percent reliable to prevent no cities from getting hit.   


Yes, the US military can probably win a military victory against North Korea, however I think tables will turn if China starts supporting the North Koreans. They can send their troops intermixed with NK's troops, making US fears of using tactical nuclear weapons on Chinese too much of a risk. US assets will have to be diverted to fighting China rather focus on the NK peninsula. US and China might agree to a ceasefire and NK will effectively rule the radioactive peninsula.

COMMENTS:
>Of course US troops can use employ tactical nuclear weapons

I read this a lot, and it annoys the hell out of me. When I read this I realise most people have absolutely no idea about nuclear weapons. People talk about tactical nuclear weapons as if they are an easy go to option. "Oh, It's only a tactical nuke" they say. 

Firstly a tactical nuclear weapon is a weapon with a yield generally at or under 100kt and is small enough to fit on mobile launchers. What bugs me is people at least in conversation seem to think it's just like some easy to deploy and use weapon and because it's "tactical" no one will care. Remember that 100kt number I used earlier, that is not a small localised explosion. You know the size of the two bombs dropped on Japan in WW2 was? They were 15 and 21kt respectively, thus the largest "tactical" nukes are ~5 times larger than the Nagasaki explosion. And are only just slightly larger than most smaller tactical weapons. Even low yield nukes will create radiation problems for surrounding countries

Secondly we have use, you cannot hide use of nuclear weapons. Their detonation is unique, as is their overall signature. Thus using one invites reciprocal retaliation. 

Now back to main topic, NK does not need nuclear weapons to basically hold SK hostage, The first 48 hrs of full blown war with NK will see Seoul obliterated by conventional weapons. So for SK any war is a bad idea.

For the US The chance of a strike making it to the ground is fairly good. SLBM's are the biggest threat since they have a low ballistic arc. Also you have a big country, you cannot defend all of it some missiles will get through.  

What all this rambling is saying is any war with NK runs the risk of escalation, reciprocation, and a lose/lose scenario. You do not win if the prize is a radioactive wateland.
---
North Korea can obliterate every single major South Korean city, not just Seoul metro area, which has over 50% of SK's total population.
---
North Korean nuclear weapons would absolutely destroy every single South Korean city. It's precisely because you are South Korean that you are in denial because South Korean can do nothing about it.

Air supremacy is meaningless during Vietnam and Korean wars when US achieved air supremacy, but still lost the war. The Chinese would never allow North Korea to fall to US troops ever again, much less SK troops.
---
ICBM armed or not North Korea cannot engage a war against the United States and South Korea simultaneously. It is impossible. North Korea's total GDP is lesser than a provincial South Korean city. They are completely outmatched in every dimension, except for nuclear weapons. If you take the US forces in consideration then disparity is a lot greater. IMHO, the US has nothing to fear from North Korea. They should be wary of China or Russia for sure but North Korea? It is like being afraid of Somalia or Uganda (I mean no disrespect but that is the fact). Actually, North Korea does not have any chance of winning a conventional war against South Korea either. South Korea overwhelms the North in terms of population, productivity, ammunition, fuel and armaments in far greater dimension. North Korea may succeed in obliterating Seoul, but at the cost of their entire country and army destroyed.
---
>Yes, the US military can probably win a military victory against North Korea,

The US can win military victory in Vietnam war too, but the domestic US public can't handle the vast colossal casualties associated with a second Korean war.

That's why NK has a nuclear weapon, and why US can't do anything about it.

TITLE: Why a military spat between Japan and South Korea could snowball into crisis

POST: https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/26/asia/south-korea-japan-spat-intl/index.html

COMMENTS:
Thanks for this. I do appreciate an English-source article summarizing the issue, despite CNN's low credibility, because I do not trust Korean or Japanese media to be objective on the issue either.

&#x200B;

A popular Korean interpretation - and, for full disclosure, one which I believe as well - of the whole "military spat" is that Japan is using this as a wrench to somehow derail the US-NK nuclear negotiation, which would prevent further Seoul-Pyongyang cooperation. Just as France went into crisis mode when it looked like Germany was about to be united (1870) / reunited (1990), many believe Japan is using all the tricks up its sleeve to prevent better relations between the two Koreas. A South Korea freer from threats of war would make it an even deadlier opponent of Corporate Japan; a North Korea, no longer an outcast in international community, will start pressuring Japan for a financial settlement of the damages caused by colonial rule, just as South Korea had done in the 60s.

&#x200B;

Koreans also believe that the Abe administration is using the crisis to whip up support from its nationalist base, because there is a growing scandal over misstatements in economic statistics produced by the Japanese statistical agency. ([https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Abenomics-under-pressure-as-Japan-s-data-scandal-spreads](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Abenomics-under-pressure-as-Japan-s-data-scandal-spreads)) Abe might have been systematically lying about the supposed economic resurgence that Japan enjoyed under his rule - a foreign distraction is most helpful for his embattled cabinet.

&#x200B;

These explanations, which I think are quite obvious from a geopolitical standpoint, have unfortunately not been included in the CNN article. But I do think this gets to the bottom of the issue; from my untrained eye, I have seen countries work out even incidents where human lives are lost. By contrast, Japan has been harping about a radar lock-on for a month. It all seems suspect.

&#x200B;

PS. It is a shame that this conflict is not more discussed in Western media. South Korea and Japan are the world's 11th and the 3rd largest economies, respectively, with military hardware to match. This conflict is comparable to the war of words between Germany and Turkeys' Erdogan in 2017, but with guns, but there has been little to no reporting on the issue.
---
In a way I am a little surprised this hasn't received as much coverage from the usual places you'd expect.

The article itself takes the time to point out the historical context of this incident and of overall SK-Japan ties, which is very important. A few choice quotes are "the context is key" and "suppressed animosities are starting to crack through". 

I am somewhat reminded of the late 2000s/early 2010s events between China and Japan in terms of overall suspicion and posturing. The "unresolved history" between China and Japan that played a role in the chill in ties is also a parallel that the SK-Japan relationship has. In East Asia and Asia overall there are unfortunately many cases of perceived historical greivances that affect contemporary politics.

However I certainly do not predict anything as severe in the SK-Japan relationship as what happened between China and Japan, at least not based on what's happened so far.
---
> Behind all these is the geopolitical change that SK is seeking an alliance with nuclear-armed NK. 

&#x200B;

You are not a serious observer if this is what you think. You sound like a far-right nut in South Korea, crying about the "jusapa (pro-NK operatives controlled by Pyongyang)" in power in Seoul.

&#x200B;

As for the radar incident, Seoul's response was that Japanese aircraft made close & dangerous maneuvers against the Korean ship, but never triggered the radar lock-on in the first place, and provided evidence to that effect. I am not qualified to assess Korean or Japanese evidence for their statements regarding the first incident, but neither are you. Whereas the second and third provocations by Japanese aircraft against South Korean naval ships are extremely well documented.

&#x200B;

I was watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHJsoCAREsg) on the rise of nationalism in Japan and wondered what percentage of the Japanese population agreed with this nostalgia for the greatness of the Japanese empire. If you don't like this source, here's [another take](https://www.wsj.com/video/japans-rising-nationalism/0FBAF32D-22E8-4B43-A911-04F89BDF65A6.html) on the same topic. This short video is a little older. You are also starting to see the nationalism show up in manga. While the rise of nationalism is not limited to Japan, it does have implications for the region.
---
North Korea would be a massive deadweight to South Korea, the amount of investment needed to even bring it to anything close to normal would come at huge financial cost and a massive opportunity cost.  Even in the long term it would likely benefit Japan and other rivals of Korea.  The comparable German unification had a much smaller gap and still has cost amost **2 trillion**.  The population gap is worse for Korea as well.  

Japan likely wants a stricter policy towards N.Korea. South Korea is again doing its sunshine policy which is the opposite of what Japan wants.  I don't see any indication Japan want's the U.S. talks to stall. 

Abe is likely using this as a distraction and to help popularize his push for increased military spending.  Similarly a spat with Japan is good for Korean politicians.   

>his conflict is comparable to the war of words between Germany and Turkeys' Erdogan in 2017, but with guns, but there has been little to no reporting on the issue

Turkey has been drifting away from the west and that spat was a sign of where it is now.  Turkey has some influence over Germany through its policy towards refugees as well.  It was a much more interesting conflict.     

Relations souring in a cold conflict between nations with already sour relations is not really news.  Nothing will change out of this, the small chance at a "crisis" will likely not manifest and even if it did its not going to be hot.

TITLE: Why is Thailand willing to deport North Korean defectors to South Korea?

POST: I am pretty green to the field of international politics, so it is something I can't figure out myself. I had recently learned that many North Korean defectors would choose to go to Thailand, for Thailand will deport them to South Korea, where they would be [accepted and recognized as citizens] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_defectors_in_Thailand). My simple understanding to this is that Thailand may earn the ire of North Korea by doing this. What is the reason behind it?

COMMENTS:
Because South Korea is far more important to Thailand than North Korea.  Thailand has always been oasis of stability in Mainland SEA.  They have tens of thousands of refugees from Myanmar, some have been in Thailand for decades.
---
It is not a nice thing to make enemies, even if it is North Korea. But traditionally Thailand was in US's sphere (e.g. they fought on the US/SK side in the Korean war), and Thailand does not have diplomatic relationship with North Korea. So they could pretend it is due to a technicality (i.e. no NK embassy in Thailand) without causing a big stir.

Thailand buys navy ships from South Korea. They usually try to stay as NATO's friend.
---
And Indonesia. North Korea was once the social butterfly among non-alignment countries, because they were competing with South Korea for recognition. Before USSR broke up, North Korea also had a strong economy, relatively speaking.
---
Plus, what sort of retaliation could North Korea even bring against Thailand? Not much, I imagine.
---
Thailand always seems to land on it's feet. 

I don't know of any major civil wars, the nation has remained essentially independent through the colonial era till decolonization. They are one of the few Asian countries where there was practically no fighting during WW2. Then in the modern era, each of its neighbors fought brutal civil wars between liberals or conservatives, or ethnic groups, Thailand mostly weathered the storm.

I'll admit some of this assesment may just be due to ignorance. I'm sure theyve had their own troubles, but compared to pretty much every other SEA country?

TITLE: South Korea starts seizing JPN assets in violation of the 1965 SK JPN treaty.

COMMENTS:
Not surprising that Japan is waiting for a statement from the US since that is about the only thing in common that these two countries have. Also why the editorialized title?
---
The backgorund of this dispute:

SK and JPN settled all claims on both sides with the 1965 SK JPN treaty and accompanying agreement, which established diplomatic relationship between two countries. JPN's positon was JPN pays if there is an appropriate reason to pay. For wartime laborers, JPN proposed directly compensating now Korean citizens (former JPN citizens) according to the same standard that JPN does for JPN citiznes. SK refused the proposal and insisted that the SK government receive the money and SK decides how to use it. In the end the deal was struck that JPN gives 5 million dollars to SK on the conditon that SK makes no future claims whatsoever. Especially, the compensation for wartime laborers is explicitly included in "the claimes that cannot be made" in the memorandum following the treaty.

Last year, the supreme court in SK decide handed down a decision that JPN company should pay wartime laborers. How did they do that when it is explicitly written that they cannot do that? The supreme court made two revolutionary and creative argument. 1. Statue of limitation does not apply here (since this is a civil case, statue of limitation is 10 years) because this is evil colonization done by evil JPN. 2. This is consolation money to work under colonization, not compensation for the work per se.

This means theoretically all SK nationals and their descendants can sue JPN companies for "consolation money". Then what is the point of settling scores and establishing diplomatic relationship?
---
But if it is a judicial order, isn't the SK govt. bound to follow it? Unless a review petition(I don't know the procedure in SK) or something is heard by the SK supreme Court?

Also, how is the popular sentiment about this in SK? Does the govt. have anything to gain electorally from doing this?
---
This is my first post. I hope I met the requiement. If not, please let me know.
---
Thank you for your input. 
The comfort women debacle is the reason that JPN will never produce a fund to give extra money. Political bodies in SK will pick up the move and make things much worse. Based on the experiences of reconciliation, the sad reality is an apology makes things worse. Any apology will be deemed not sincere enough.

TITLE: A geopolitical strategy for South Korea

POST: South Korea is the 11th largest economy of the world and has a fair level of autonomy in political and military affairs. It is the only country - among so many other former colonies liberated after WW2 - to have achieved first world status. We have a population of over 50 million and we have an evenly distributed economy encompassing heavy industry and IT start-ups. Now, our competition with North Korea, which haunted 2 generations before me (I'm in my 30s), is over. We overwhelm North Korea in every dimension and there is absolutely no chance that South Korea would be invaded and conquered by North Korea. It is like comparing the power of US and Mexico. We know that, and they know that too. Hence, the nukes. North Korea's nuclear arsenal is the only credible threat(or deterrent) to South Korea and that is why they are reluctant to give them up. However, I do not consider North Korea as an existential threat. They are just a risk which must be managed accordingly, something like diabetes. You cannot get rid of it but you can manage it. 

On the other hand, the true existential threat to South Korea is China, its colossal neighbor. China's ambition is grander in scale and scope and their concern is domination, not survival (which is the case of North Korea). It is no secret that they want to re-establish its dominant role in East Asia as in those days of the Qing dynasty or the Ming dynasty and we South Koreans are resolute in preventing that from happening. China's power is growing day by day and now it has become the undisputed rival of the United States. Never has the US faced a similar rival in its entire history. China's economy already dwarfs that of the USSR at its height and is now a very formidable power in most dimensions. Therefore, I view Trump's approach on China rather favorably. Yet, the US is not omnipotent so it must have focus and select priorities. In this light, I believe the US should reach a compromise with Russia. Even Stephen Kotkin seems to advocate such action. Russia is no longer a credible threat to US power. Its economy is but 1/15 of America's. It can barely assert its power beyond Ukraine. Central Asia which has traditionally been under Russia's influence, is being taken away by China. Stephen Kotkin has once remarked that Russia was almost a Chinese colony. He even went further by saying "should Russia crumble, Hungary would have a border with China."  I am pretty much sure that Putin does not want to become a vassal of China and that he is proud of being Russian and its cultural heritage. 

So what does all this have to do with South Korea? First, China must be contained but its focus should be driven away from the Korean peninsula. Second, to that end, South Korea must reach a compromise with North Korea and bring it to the modern world. Third, South Korea must help Russia to develop economically as well as socially so that it can become another bulwark to contain China. South Korea is the only major economy which does not pose a geopolitical threat to Russia. We enjoy cordial relations and Russia is viewed favorably by many Koreans as well. Tourism to Vladivostok has skyrocketed during the last 3 years and Koreans are eager to invest in Russia. Many Russians are coming to South Korea for medical reasons too (South Korea has one of the most efficient and professional medical sector in the world).  Furthermore, if we could lay pipelines to import Russian gas, it will be a huge win-win for both countries. It would be a major benefit in geopolitical sense too, since it will serve as a restraining tool for North Korea's behavior. For example, North Korea may decide to cut off the pipeline at any moment but if they do that, they should expect Russia's wrath coming. And let's not forget that they have a land border with Russia. 

But in order to bring North Korea and Russia to our side, we need to convince the US to alleviate a number of sanctions imposed on both countries. None of them are a geopolitical threat to US primacy in world affairs. The only credible rival to US power is China. There is an old proverb in East Asia which goes as follows: "遠交近攻"(Make friends with those afar, and attack those near). It is a natural diplomatic instinct to ally a great power beyond our borders to counter balance another great power just right next door. Fear of China is what could align North Korea, Russia and South Korea to US leadership. South Korea is an ally of the US already but Russia and North Korea are not and they have their own exclusive interests. NK's is survival and Russia's is influence in Ukraine and central Asia. I believe those are negotiable interests. 

South Korea's geopolitical interests can only be achieved through an amicable network with several players. The KOR-US alliance is the body and a stronger and friendly relation with North Korea and Russia should become its right arm and left arm accordingly.

COMMENTS:
> On the other hand, the true existential threat to South Korea is China, its colossal neighbor. ... It is no secret that they want to re-establish its dominant role in East Asia as in those days of the Qing dynasty or the Ming dynasty...

Interesting claim. It can't really be substantiated by the examples you gave: the Ming and Qing dynasties *did not* pose an *existential threat* to Korea. But states based in China *have* posed existential threats to states based in Korea, before, during the Han and Tang periods. These periods, however, were marked by an unique dynamic - a very relevant one to the present day - under which "Korea" attempted to ally with a northern rival of "China" for the purpose of challenging a rising dynastic power in China, only to be destroyed when that northern rival failed to come to its rescue. To be specific:

* During the Han dynasty, Wiman Joseon, based in North Korea, allied with the Xiongnu to contain the rising power of the Han, to which the Han responded by invading Wiman Joseon in preparation for its war against the Xiongnu. Wiman Joseon was destroyed.

* During the Sui and Tang dynasties, Goguryeo allied with the Gokturks to contain the rising power of the Sui, to which the Sui responded by invading Goguryeo. Goguryeo successfully defeated the Sui, but the succeeding Tang crushed the Gokturks, and then allied with a rival power on the Korean peninsula to destroy Goguryeo and its ally Baekje, ending the existence of both states.

There are other instances of miscalculated alliances, as well - the early Joseon state allied with the Ming Dynasty against the Manchus, only to be invaded and reduced to a vassal when the Manchus crushed the Ming and established the Qing. The late Joseon state allied with the Qing Dynasty against the Japanese, only to be invaded and reduced to a colony when the Japanese crushed the Qing and established the Japanese Empire.

All in all, it would seem that the common lesson is: whenever Korea allies itself with a declining power against a rising power, the results are disastrous. Of course, hind sight is perfect, and we shouldn't blame Korean rulers too much for having made the wrong choice of allies without the benefit of knowing what's going to happen. But we could also look at this from a different angle, which is that *China becomes an existential threat to Korea exactly when Korea becomes a major threat to China through allying with China's main enemy in East Asia.*

To this end, what you are suggesting is correct, to a degree - China is an existential threat to South Korea, but not because "China" has always been an existential threat to "Korea," or because China is trying to be the Ming or Qing dynasties, but rather because South Korea is allied with the United States, China's main threat in the equation. Yet, cultivating Russia would be even worse, in this respect, because it is essentially the same as Goguryeo's alliance with the Gokturks, and Wiman Joseon's alliance with the Xiongnu: a northern rival of China's that failed to come to Korea's rescue due to distance and due to the fact that it turned out to be a weaker power than China.

It is precisely in these scenarios that states in Korea risk being completely destroyed by states in China, as happened to Wiman Joseon and Goguryeo: because when dynasties in China are convinced that states in Korea are attempting to cultivate an alliance of containment, it invariably begins to regard Korea as a major threat, and seek to destroy it. To prevent this from happening, Korea must either ensure that its ally can, in fact, reliably contain and defeat China, and perhaps more importantly, *that it is willing to do so for the sake of Korea*; or, it must choose a different dynamic - such as an alliance with China - which has historically brought peace and autonomy to the peninsula at the cost of having to acknowledge Chinese hegemony, *as long as China was the strongest power around*. Of course, when Japan or the Manchus became the strongest power - strong enough to conquer China themselves - then the alliance with China could back fire, for pretty much the same reasons.

In this post, I have analyzed the history of Chinese Korean relations, to an extent because you brought it up, but also to an extent because I think your geopolitical strategy is rather ridiculous. Russia, in the short and medium term, cannot and will not challenge China for hegemony in Northeast Asia, and the Russian heart land is much too far for Russians to *really* want to commit to a defense of Korea. Their logistics would be stretched across a vast distance, and they'd be taking tremendous risks against a Chinese counter attack, given that they share the longest border in the world with China. This is even ignoring the fact that modern Russia is, in fact, friendly with China, and that South Korea would be hard pressed to offer anything to break this partnership, as long as the threat of the United States exists - which South Korea, in fact, actively contributes to, being in alliance with the US. All of these factors make it impossible to envision a South Korea - North Korea - Russia - US network of containment against China, not unless US Russian relations become *much* better than they are today and the Russians become willing to be played by the US as the first line of defense against China.

I don't see that happening. The Russians have too little to gain from such an arrangement and too much to potentially lose. They'd rather play the US against China, so that they can advance their interests in Europe. At the same time, making an enemy out of China is *extremely* risky for Korea - as history has shown - and this has only become more so today, with Korea being a highly urbanized peninsula in range of all of China's ballistic missiles. Nearly 40% of the South Korean population live in the Seoul metropolitan area. Such a state would be *devastated* by a war with China.

For this reason, I find it absurd to suggest that this is South Korea's best strategy for maintaining its autonomy. It is refuted by both history - which would argue for an alliance with the *strongest* power around, since they tend to leave Korea alone when it is not a threat to them - and by modern geopolitics - which would argue for either striking a balance between the US and China, or committing to the side that is most likely to win a confrontation while being willing to intervene for Korea. Whatever the case, relying on Russia should be avoided, since Russia has neither the ability nor the cause to fight a war of containment against China.
---
How is China an existential threat? All you really talk about here is China's economy. The rest is just vague mumbling when no specifics.
---
Historically China and Korea enjoys more harmonious time than hostile time. I don't see why that can't happen in modern time, especially considering SK can accept US leadership. The only difference is China's power has only been emerging recently so it is emotionally difficult for SK people to accept. The most prominent conflict between China and SK now is the highly overlapped industrial structure. ideology and geopolitics reasons are all secondary. existential threat is too heavy.
---
That's because traditionally speaking, the Korean Kingdom that allies with Imperial China is the state that eventually reunifes the Korean peninsula.

&#x200B;

South Korea is essentially Baekje, which has allied with far flung Goguryeo-Japan Wa alliance (DPRK-USA)  to offset the Tang-Silla alliance (PRC-DPRK). We all know how that turned out. Even if South Korea tries to emulate the martial spirit of Goguryeo, they got destroyed as well too. Buyeo, Balhae, or any other remnant? Silla is who South Korea should strive to become.

&#x200B;

If South Korea knew any better, it would attempt to ally with China to dominate the Korean peninsula. It's just that China is still emerging and US is still dominant, so South Korean collective mind cannot comprehend ceasing to serve the Great USA ([Sadaejuii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadaejuui)) just yet.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;
---
Translation: Please don't abandon me, and get more powerful allies.

&#x200B;

If South Korea knew any better, it would switch camps when it's opportune and pre-empt US ditching it a la Taiwan or South Vietnam.

&#x200B;

Be a Silla, don't be a Baekje.

TITLE: Global Security Implications for (Northern-lead) Union/Confederation Between North and South Korea

POST: SCMP recently published an excellent article about the recent drive by the South Korean government to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis, and the broader inter-Korean conflict in general, by reunifying with North Korea into a One-Country/Two-System Union or Confederation, which I have occasionally argued on here was the real crisis the nuclear drama was building toward all along. 


https://m.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2170456/could-hong-kongs-one-country-two-systems-work-korea


Why do I describe it as a "crisis"? Because there's very little reason to believe union/confederation will resolve the conflict, pacify the Kim Regime, soften North Korea/lead to its eventual absorption by the South or even lead to peaceful coexistence between the two states. 


On the contrary, union/confederation could (and probably would) leave South Korea dangerously exposed to North Korean infiltration, political manipulation and coercion. There's a lot of evidence and analysis that suggests Kim will take every opportunity over the following several years after reunification to try and extract money/resources from the South, wrest political powers away from it and bully it into becoming the lesser, subservient power; possibly even with the goal of one day absorbing South Korea into the North. 


(Indeed, North Korea has always seen Confederation as a possible means of "peacefully" conquering South Korea) 


Personally, I think Kim *might* denuclearize, but only at the cost of outside powers butting out and letting it continue to cannibalize South Korea. I think this also *could* lead to a conventional war (if, for example, South Korea resists or tries to pull out later, which may compel Kim to retaliate or attempt a hard/fast-takeover in order to keep the South from slipping from his grasp, and if SK asks the US for help after). 


Still, even if that doesn't happen, I think Kim will go the Russia-route and resort to asymmetric hybrid warfare in order to bully or manipulate South Korea into compliance; there's other ways to conquer a state besides outright military invasion.


Even if "Korean War II" isn't a conventional military conflict (which I've argued that it won't be), the global and regional security implications (as well as the American national security implications) are severe.


(Seriously, it's baffling why this isn't a bigger story and alarm bells aren't going off in the US public discourse) 


It's difficult to list them in any specific order, so I guess I will just use the shotgun-approach lay them all out, since it's extraordinarily difficult to find any serious predictions on how this can all turn out.


(And once again, I'm going on the assumption that union/confederation would be led and dominated by the North Koreans) 


**A)** If North Korea and South Korea reunify, would the ROK-US Alliance treaties and charters instantly become null-and-void (as well as all of the international sanctions against North Korea)? Would a "Korean Union" or "Korean Federation" or "United States of Korea" constitute a successor-state that is not bound by the treaties of its former constituent-states?

(I don't think there's anyway to be allies with, or to sanction, "half of a state" against its other half.)


**B)** Even if the US could be allies with Seoul after the deal is signed, it's difficult to see how political support for the alliance could be maintained for long.


The ROK-US Alliance was established with the goal of compelling the US to defend South Korea from a hostile North Korea. Union/Confederation might mean there won't be a "South Korea" for the US to defend (nor a "North Korea to defend it from).


**C)** Would Americans determine there is no longer a point in sending US troops to Korea and pull them out? Would South Koreans determine there is no longer a point in keeping US troops in Korea and evict them?


Or would China (which has *Okay*-relations with South Korea) bear down on South Korea and force them too kick US troops out and terminate the Alliance? Right now, China only maintains decent relations with South Korea (despite hosting US troops) because they understand the threat North Korea poses to the South; it's difficult to see why they would continue tolerating US troops in South Korea once union/confederation takes place.


(Korea scholar BR Myers has stated, "Imagine if the US military were [in Korea] *purely* as a counterweight to China...China would bring this whole peninsula to its knees in a matter of months.") 


https://soundcloud.com/war_college/north-koreas-long-game

**D)** If the US is stupid enough to maintain the ROK-US Alliance after North-South union/confederation, what risks does that pose to the US? The US and ROK militaries are deeply integrated; if North Korea were to merge with the South, how much access would that give them to US military strategy, tactics and intelligence by-proxy?

**E)** Joshua Stanton (a former US Forces Korea officer who's testified on ROK-US Alliance issues to congress written for FP, the WSJ, etc.) has said that it is no coincidence that North Korea developed its cyber-warfare capabilities at the same pace South Korea (famously) became the most wired society on earth.


http://freekorea.us/2017/12/11/korean-war-ii-a-hypothesis-explained-and-a-fisking/#sthash.ODYJ57MC.wpNt22Xv.dpbs


I think the implications are that North Korea doesn't want to nationalize or stamp out South Korea's market economy, but rather to profit off of it.


And quite possibly, exploit it for its own transnational criminal operations (drug manufacturing, arms smuggling, counterfeiting, cyber crime/terrorism, etc.)


What are the chances union/confederation will lead to, say, North Korean spy-ware on Samsung Galaxy phones? Or North Korean drugs/weapons being smuggled through South Korean ports (or maybe on Korean Air jets)?


**F)** If KJU fails to restrain himself (let's be honest; he will) and the outside world continues to feel the need to isolate and sanction him, what are the chances that will negatively impact South Koreas too?


If the two states confederate/unionize, is there a risk that ordinary South Koreans might be turned away from traveling or doing business with other countries (simply because they *might* be doing business with NK, might be NK spies themselves, etc)?


**G)** Almost two years ago Colin Marshall, of the LA Review of Books, wrote an article about the "Koreanization of American Politics," where he warned that people should look to South Korea to get a glimpse of where America is going in the future. 

http://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/the-korea-blog/anti-trump-protests-anti-park-protests-koreanization-american-politics/

Ever since then, much of what's happened in South Korea is frighteningly similar to Russia's hybrid war against the US and the EU (hyper-polarization, fake-news/foreign-propaganda, the erosion of their alliances, irregular and sometimes-illegal connections between heads of state and hostile foreign powers, etc.) 

What message would successful domination of South Korea by North Korea through union/confederation send to other countries around the world?

(Especially despotic regimes that want to "peacefully" subdue, or conquer, foreign enemies)

**H)** If the US and the Kim Regime can't make peace, and yet the South does (even if it means being dominated, or being used as a shield, by it), what are the chances of the US looking at South Korea and concluding "the friend of my enemy is also my enemy"? 

Just throwing these all out there because like I said, I think union/confederation between North Korea and South Korea is a disaster in the making and potentially *the* major global-security crisis of the coming few years, and yet I can find barely any serious analysis anywhere.

COMMENTS:
If you can find the Korean language version of that video (from which the picture was taken as a screenshot) of both leaders with wives visiting the mountain/lake and hold hands, there were some disturbing comments from Kim.

He basically said that Koreans are the most prestigious race in the world. Knowing certainly the video will be shared by all Koreans, he was aiming to further incite the nationalism sentiment to build up support. In the video Kim also questioned, "How can we be poorer than China?" but he said it in a way that he assumes Chinese being an inferior race. In other words, he has only one asset to push for unification which is nationalism, which has to be built on hatred toward foreigners (China, US, Japan). If you ask Deng Xiaoping in 1978, he would say "Chinese are the most industrious race in the world, we worked really hard. How can we be poorer than Japan?" But Deng would say so in a full introspections way and question the mistakes made by Chinese gov and how to fix them. That is a completely different vibe.

I doubt that support is strong enough to push for a confederation structure. On the other hand, we have to realize, South Korea is a stronger country with roughly twice the population. Yes Kim can cause a lot of harms to the South Koreans in a non-nuclear shooting war, but I doubt North can actually win an all out war, even without US intervention.

This is a really long-winded post, of which I cannot clearly make out what you are trying to say. But the entire post appears to rest on your assumption that:

> And once again, I'm going on the assumption that union/confederation would be led and dominated by the North Koreans

... which makes no sense. South Korea has twice the population of NK, 50 times the GDP, a military that is widely considered to be much, much stronger than its NK counterpart (despite popular misconception in the West), an infinitely greater amount of goodwill in the global community, so on and so on.

Given all this, South Korea is simply not a state that would collapse at some Russian-style cyber attacks that occurred in US and Europe (which, btw, were highly sensationalized by media), or even would lie there and take it, or even would let NK be the senior partner in any confederation. And I haven't even gotten to the part where we are still **decades** out from any meaningful integration of the South and the North - it is **mostly PR so far.**

Nothing personal, friend, but your post is wrong.

Ps. I did not bring this up in main arguments because it is not something that non-Korean speakers can easily access, but South Koreans are some of the most virulently prideful, even xenophobic people in the world - almost as much as the Japanese. The repatriated Koreans of Chinese nationality (Joseonjok/Chaoxian) still face significant discrimination even after decades of immigration. This is not a pleasant trait, but anyone who thinks that such a people would submit themselves to even poorer/less prestigious people such as North Koreans are absolutely, 100% wrong.

> including widely believed claims that Confucius is Korean and that a Korean invented the airplane more than 300 years before the Wright brothers.

These are not widely believed, although crazy nationalists have made these claims during the heyday of Korean chauvinism in the 2000s.
---
With China/US still lock horns, South Korea has no reason to distance themselves from US in any aspect. I would say NK is rather a non-factor. We also have know the infiltration of NK agents in SK, China, Japan and the rest of Asia is not a new challenge. 

My read of South Korea is that the unconditional reunification train has departed. The young people do not want reunification. The old people do, but what they really want is family reunion, they do not have a political solution. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZchtQ9-PWY) of what a few dozen people said. In other words, SK has been constantly under the threat from the North in all forms, they are pretty well adjusted to whatever the North can do next.

TITLE: What are the factors that prevented China from democratizing like Taiwan and South Korea?

POST: What are the social factors and trends within mainland China that prevented it from democratizing like Taiwan and Korea did in the late 80s? If you look at Taiwan and SK's per capita GDP in the late 80s when they started to democratise it is at around the same level as China's per capita GDP now.  So why did the political system in those countries liberalise while China's didn't? Even if not a full liberal democracy, what is preventing the Chinese political system from transitioning into a managed democracy like Singapore,  Malaysia,  or Russia, which are at least not one party states and have a real opposition which at least gets 30 percent of the vote even they if not full liberal democracies? Why hasn't China's economic liberalisation been accompanied by political liberalisation unlike the other Asian tiger economies?

COMMENTS:
It is easily making a case that Taiwan and Korea are in complete different situations than China. Both Taiwan and Korea are under US protection, they just follow US lead, including "democratizing". Choosing a path against US is not an option. That was the theme of Cold War. 

China on the other hand is a very large country that has to make independent decisions. They face different levels of challenges, different pressure from US, and their development paths can only be different.

EDIT: The simplistic view on this matter is somehow Western style liberal democracy is the ultimate form of human society, therefore, our goal is to get close to that system as possible. This is basically why US needs to save the planet from communism. This view was quite popular and peaked in 1990s during postmortem of Cold War. (e.g. Francis Fukuyama) 

The past 20 years really saw a lot of new changes in international politics. Now we have in the academics many people start to question that value system. China receives more scrutiny in a way it is destined to become the competitor/adversary of the US. Now Chinese people accept the idea of "it ain't broken, don't fix it", at the same time we noticed China/US trade war will happen regardless if what political system Chinese adopted. So there is no value to imitate the West, because you get crushed either way. China would be much more pro-democracy if the dissidents show some competency, and do not have to act so anti-Chinese culture to compete for funding once they get to the West. They all appear they lost their backbones when they actually have a chance to speak.

Korea and Taiwan do not have this burden. All they need to do during the Cold War is to look as Western as they can, so that they are included in the list of allies of the US. Now will they be surprised if the West starts to incorporate some elements of socialism in their own system?
---
Taiwan and Korea both had transitions of power from authoritarian to democratic after developing to a certain point like your said.  However China doesn't have the same domestic pressure from its population to democratize as the CCP sees a very high level of support. 

Generally speaking Chinese people see the CCP as competent and its in their best interest for current leadership to stay in power and manage the current growth and transition into being a leading power.  Remember they are still growing rapidly.  The narrative is that problems of the U.S. are problems with democracy and that the current Chinese system is better suited going into the future (at least for China) or even superior.  They see the "chaotic" populism in the U.S./West as self-sabotaging.  With many of the "freedoms" as causes of the problems (like freedom of religion) and with the growing partisanship hurting governance.  Also that any strife in China will hurt growth/opportunities and if its not broke don't fix it.  

There is also some thought that Taiwan/Korea are small and didn't challenge American hegemony when integrated into the system (and happened during the cold war) while China would potentially not be accepted even if it tried to be a liberal democracy and comply more.  


There are some obvious problems with these thoughts but overall China is growing rapidly and people are happy/optimistic about the future and see little reason to change especially with a powerful CCP.  Why fight a potentially losing battle (and certainly bitter) for something only maybe better?.  The propaganda machine is also very strong.  I think the real test will be when growth slows and when/if the west settles down a bit.
---
if china reaches americas level of prosperity, then they have no need to democratize. I mean if the CCP can lead them to that level of power, they obviously have it great.
---
Well the easiest answer is that there were no US political and economic advisors overseeing the development of mainland China, unlike Taiwan and South Korea.

I think the biggest reason China will not adopt a democratic system like the US is because it doesn't want foreign actors influencing their country.
---
I would say CCP. Chinese model is quite unique in that respect, most other prosperous nations in the 21st century have democratized. In your thoughts, should China liberalize/democratize once it reaches USA levels of prosperity and power? Really wanna know people's thoughts on this, as I wonder sometimes if Democracy is truly the ideal model of governance that the West makes it out to be.

Basically, SK and NK might work together to combat air pollution since air pollution does not recognize borders. 

One thing that might happen is this

> Instead, there is an alternative for South Korea to seek a regional détente with a natural gas pipeline. Russia’s “Power of Siberia” pipeline is planned to connect into the capital region of China. If this happens, extending the supply chain to South Korea via an undersea pipeline between China’s Shandong peninsula and Korea’s Incheon will be simpler. The pipeline would enhance the three countries’ economic ties and political cooperation.

TITLE: North and South Korea Push to End Korean War, but U.S. Remains Wary

COMMENTS:
SS: Despite starting over 70 years ago, the Korean War has technically never ended, as only a Korean Armistice (Ceasefire) has been signed, the two Koreas are still in a state-of-war without a Peace Settlement ever been signed.

&#x200B;

The Two Koreas and China are pushing to sign a Peace Treaty to formally end the 70 year old conflict, but the US remains wary, as it provides justification for the withdrawal of US troops from Korean peninsula, a strategic asset US views as essential to it's strategy of military predominance in northeast Asia and containment of China's rise.   US views that a Peace Treaty should be a "Reward" given to NK if they take adequate steps first to unilaterally denuclearize.  The South Koreans do not share this view, believing that signing a Peace Treaty will provide a conducive environment for increasing mutual trust and cooperation and relieve NK's regime survival anxieties with a formal end to Korean war with a Peace Treaty.

&#x200B;

My Personal Opinion:

&#x200B;

US risks becoming isolated if the Two Koreas and China move forward with a declaration with End of Korean war. US risks being seen as a spoiler when it's chief geopolitical competitor (China) AND it's chief East Asian ally (South Korea) both agree to push forward on Peace Treaty without US "demands" on unilateral denuclearization first.   From SK perspective, they would rather have a Peace Treaty and have peaceful mutual co-existence rather than assuming NK will never denuclearize and continuing brinkmanship every year.  From US perspective, the withdrawal of US troops from Korean would be one of the most geopolitical earth shattering events since US withdrawal from Taiwan and South Vietnam in 1970's, hearalding an era of US military power influence and decline. So Pentagon officials will try to control Trump's inherent tendencies to call for withdrawal of US troops, but it seems Defense Secretary Mattis is on Trump's bad side, so we will see how effective Pentagon's efforts to derail US withdrawal of US troops from Korea goes moving forward.

> I would absolutely love a source on this

The Pew global attitudes survey would be one, which shows South Korea (along with Japan) to be some of the most pro-US nations on the planet.

I am Korean (and I suspect u/baechu89 is too, given his name), and make no mistake; most Koreans really do see US as a savior of the world. America saved our asses in the Korean War, and US world order has saved Korea from centuries of mediocrity sandwiched between Japan and China. A majority of Koreans are pro-peace with NK, but the same majority will not go for it at the expense of KORUS alliance. The Moon administration would sooner be impeached, and I do not exaggerate.

I should also add that such pro-US attitude is in fact quite prevalent in what I would call fringes of the "Free World" - i.e. Western-aligned countries that border either Russia or China. Poland has also traditionally been more pro-US than their Western European counterparts.

TITLE: US & China talking trade, South Korea allegedly asks for an end to the Korean War, and the Department of Iranian Regime Change? - What's your take on the week that was?

POST: Here’s our take on the week that was. We’re acutely conscious that there are many smarter, and more experienced people who frequent this sub, so we’re very keen to hear your takes.

Our three most significant stories this week:

* The US and China are now putting together a process aimed at resolving their trade dispute by November, when Xi and Trump will meet.

* South Korea allegedly asked the United States to consider formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War – in a bid to break a stall in US-North Korea talks.

* The US restructured the State Department, creating a special group focused on Iran – headed up by the former Director of Policy Planning (a very senior role). Pompeo said this is about changing Iranian behaviour, while experts said this is about changing the Iranian regime. 

Our three most thought-provoking articles of the week:

* Richard Haas, himself a former Director of Policy Planning, argued that without the glue of the Soviet threat, the US-Turkey relationship is destined to deteriorate.

* Rebecca Collard of Time Magazine gave a good overview of the stakes in Idlib, Syria – a city awaiting its fate as Assad’s tanks roll into position for a potential advance.

*  David Fickling of Bloomberg asked big questions of the fundamental economics of many of China’s Belt and Road projects, and argued that there are “echoes” of Soviet era collapse in Beijing’s misdirected spending. 

Three events to watch in the coming week:

* Whether the US and Turkey can patch over some of their many differences, after Turkey’s Foreign Minister said, “we are ready to talk about everything” so long as there’s “no threatening, no dictating”.

* Whether agreement on process can translate to agreement on sticky substantive issues at the US-China trade talks on 22 & 23 August.

* Whether US National Security Advisor John Bolton can make modest progress with Russia on arms control, at the follow up to the Trump-Putin summit.

A a full set of links to the referenced stories is available on our [site] (https://www.ambassadorsbrief.com/posts/NW8S5L7iTiwKrTMPk) 

Hopefully that's enough to kick off a bit of discussion. - We're especially interested in hearing your predictions for the events in the coming week, and what to make of the "Iran Action Group"

COMMENTS:
Not a lot of English media reported Chinese economy data of July (released two days ago) :

* GDP growth 6.5%+ yoy (they only released subsection data, 6.5% is my rough calculate)
* some hi tech industries had 30% growth yoy
* domestic consumption growth 8% yoy
* CPI 2% yoy
* Pork retail price -12% yoy (2017 pork production exceeded demand, price continued to go lower in 2018)

The impact of trade war has not shown. Pork production is lower than last year so demand for soybean may be weaker than before. For Chinese eco data there is always a concern it could be fake. With that said, the speaker from stats bureau was concerned with trade war's negtive impact on growth.

COMMENTS:
Well given the mines and other armaments that are left there, you wouldn't catch me moving into the newly opened DMZ neighbourhoods.
---
SS: The Pentagon is reporting that military drills are being suspended on the Korean Peninsula following the Trump-Kim summit. The last of such events saw tensions rising rapidly in the region in March between the three countries and regional partners. Now, off the back of the summit, Vice President Pence has stated the drills will be suspended as long as North Korea follows through with its promise to work to denuclearisation. 

The next military drill was scheduled for roughly August/Fall time which leaves some room for this commitment to fall over and the military drill still take place later this year. Time will tell if this action takes place, but one thing is certain, this is a movement in the direction that the drills are being suspended and not just rhetoric from Trump.
---
But the housing market is going to see explosive growth! Everyone wants a little piece of land they can call "Mine". If you don't act on this opportunity it will blow up in your face. Think of all the places to practice your *parallel parking*.
---
Like it says in the post, *suspended indefinitely* as-long as NK upholds its end of the bargain. I wouldn't exactly call it indefinite even if thats the term the military used. Suspended for now, possibly resumed later.

I wouldn't say that it took the US a year to change their mind and recognise reality, but maybe more so that within a year, the reality changed and allowed this agreement to take place. A lot has changed within the year including mid term elections coming up, China wanting to avoid the trade war, South Korea making extreme overtures to NK. 

I'd say the reality has changed quite a lot in a year, not that the US has changed its position on a whim.

I hope they keep the DMZ as a nature preserve on an indefinite basis.

COMMENTS:
Indeed!

I think reducing the presence of a meager 26K US troops, the resulting vague "loss of influence" is more than enough compensated by the security of not going to nuclear war.

That's the problem with ruling class, they prioritize vague "influence" and projection of power over the actual security of the population (e.g. warfare with nukes).

If their true intent is reduce or eliminate NK's nuclear threat, then a meager 26K US troops and exercises is a drop in the water in terms of the gains of protection from nuclear attack for millions of Japanese and American people. But the security of population isn't priority when they say: "it harms out 'security'".
---
Its historical fact to say Western powers and Japan competed for influence in the Pacific but to say America provoked Japan's imperialistic war of aggression across asia is victim blaming at its finest. To then go on and suggest Japans post war history has been characterized by widespread insecurity and economic hardship is absurd to anyone with a passing familiarity of Japans place in the world.

It really doesnt matter what motivations parts of the US government had, at the end of the day Japan started an offensive war.

TITLE: Trump’s Talks With Kim Jong-un Collapse After North Korea Demands End to Sanctions

COMMENTS:
North Korea believes low level talks are pointless because Trump will just arbitrarily over rule his people with a tweet.

At least some in the Trump administration think high level talks are needed because they will fail quickly and then the US can move on to other methods.

And lets be fair, the 5 party talks, leap day agreement etc all took years and years and accomplished very little.
---
SS:

Its anticlimactic: the second Kim - Trump talk ended soon after it began. According to Trump: DPRK asked for the lifting of sanctions in exchange for dismantling the Yongbyon nuclear site. The Americans refused the bargin, and according to Pompeo: the DPRK nuclear program must be dismantled entirely in order to for the sanctions to lift.

While Kim did signal a willingness to denuclearize in his reponse to an American reporter, it would seem that there has been a serious miscalculation between the two countries as to the value of the DPRK nuclear program.

Notably, Trump was yet again quoted to have underplayed the failure of the denuclearization talks, and seems outwardly optimistic juding by his lines in the NYT article.

Speculation

1. Would this give China more leverage in the Sino - US trade talks? Seeing as how the trade talks is widely perceived as an avenue to negotiate a new "Great Power Relationship" (I realize that even the Chinese has given up on pushing the term, the concept however, might still remain relevant)
2. Given Trumps outstanding personality, it would seem some what likely that some high level talks will continue to be actively pursued as an American policy priority?
3. Just how wide the gulf is between DPRK and US in terms of having to establish some viable framework underwhich future deals can be negotiated without honestly embarrassing both sides?
---
Neither unexpected nor disastrous, although disappointing.

It is even somewhat pleasantly surprising, in a way, that Trump knows a bad deal when he sees it (total sanctions lifting for Yongbyon shutdown) and is able to walk away. Many, many people in US and other places accused him of not being able to do so.

Trump and the Americans did not leave in an acrimonious mood, they asked President Moon Jae-in to mediate, they are still willing to talk - I think the ball is now in NK's court, and is also up to South Korea on how to coax and convince NK. 

And I am obviously of the opinion that Kim should press forward with normalization of NK, even if he has to make much greater nuclear concessions. He repeatedly promised his people a better life, enabled by lifting of sanctions and some liberalization. He needs to make good on that promise, and Trump - by being the only US president to extend a hand to him - remains his best bet.
---
Whats the point of Trump and Kim meeting when they are not actually finalizing any steps or needing these meetings symbolcially.

If truly these ended because of basic disagreements on how to proceed on things they have talked a dozen times over, they could have just kept it with the lower high level people discussing this between the countries dduring low media attention closed doors meetings.
---
1) do we know there will be a third meeting?

2) How does this pressure KJU to make concession? sitting with a US president as equals amd maintaining the status quo as a nuclear power seems to be an acceptable outcome for the regime.

South Korea can defend itself and the presence of American troops is cited by Kim Jong Un as the reason why North Korea will not give up its nuclear arsenal (as they fear an American-led campaign for regime change). If NK does give up nukes the US is signalling it's able and willing to go beyond removal of forces.

President Trump and Chairman Kim will meet in Hanoi, Vietnam on February 27/28 for the second summit.

Tbf, every single US president since the 70s has "loved" the Saudis. But that shouldn't take anything away from your comment.

TITLE: Trump Appears to Have Misled Kim Jong-un at the Singapore Summit: Comparing Oranges with Apples Is Wrong and Dangerous. - Analysans

COMMENTS:
Submission Statement:

Trump mislead Kim Jong Un to get him sign the communique at Singapore, it was to distract from controversies and scandals Trump and his administrations have while also to improve prospects of upcoming mid-term elections.

Kim's visit to China was to inforn Xi and include China in peace declaration, also the media primarily or solely focused on intentions of North Korea and next to nothing about intentions by the United States with narrative being that NK doesn't have intention to disarm, this narrative is atleast partialy proven wrong by Vox's report on Trump's peace declaration promise to Kim Jong Un.

TITLE: Trump promised Kim Jong Un he’d sign an agreement to end the Korean War

COMMENTS:
Promises made by this administration need to be taken with a degree of skepticism, to say the least.
---
In the coming days, expect lots of news articles blaming N.Korean leadership and crazy outbursts filled with threat as the reason why talks with N.Korea failed. Pseudo intellectuals will claim that Kim was using the madman strategy the whole time to get tiny aid concessions and really had no intentions to make a deal.

Meanwhile, the US establishment knows exactly what the North Koreans want and how to negiotiate a deal. They also know that to actually and meaningfully seek a peace deal is to lose North Korea as a reason to keep troops next to China and to keep S.Korea as a entrenched member of the East Asia Triple Alliance.
---
I think you misunderstand. 

There is no easy fix that serves American interests since it is in America's interests to have a forward position against China and to keep S.Korea firmly in line with Japan against a Chinese threat/future. Thus it is in America's interest to never seek a real peace deal with N.Korea. 

Thus, the general narrative put forth in media tends to paint a picture detailing  N.Korea as a crazy and belligerent international bully (which is partially true as all good propaganda is) to justify American presence in S.Korea while ignoring the detrimental role America plays in maintaining the conflict.

From a S.Korean perspective, a good case can be made that American refusal to end the state of war is a bigger obstacle to peace than anything the N.Koreans are doing atm.

US troops in Korea is a 'necessary evil' to contain China's rise. The Koreans just have to put up with it.

TITLE: My take on Trumps meeting with Kim Jong Un

POST: 1. We are caught in a strange historical moment. Trump, the American President just shook hands happily with a North Korean Dictator. 

2. US policy makers and president alike wouldn’t be caught dead shaking hands with a North Korean Dictator.  (Although Clinton did meet with the Kim Jung Il Citation: [https://abcnews.go.com/International/prominent-americans-met-north-korean-leaders/story?id=53635089](https://abcnews.go.com/International/prominent-americans-met-north-korean-leaders/story?id=53635089)).  However President is Trump is an anomaly.  He truly seems to act on his own, good or bad.  So why was Trump able to set up this seemingly peaceful meeting, especially after all the “little rocket man” rhetoric?

3. North Korea is pretty isolated.  Its main allies are China, who acts like a big brother, and Russia.  Russia doesn’t affiliate themselves with too much with North Korea, but some speculate Russia helped North Korea obtain nuclear capabilities more quickly.  They share a small border as well.

4. In the Trump era, America has entered a strange space.  He doesn’t follow normal American policy, which is obvious.  

5. During the 2016 American presidential primaries the Republican Party changed an important party policy on the Crimea takeover by Russia.  Trump apparently directed the change to more or less support the Russians on the Crimea annexation.  Trump even recently repeated a talking point by Putin himself saying “everyone there speaks Russian”, therefore Crimea is essentially Russian territory.

6. Trump has flip flopped and given criticism to everyone in the past two years, even his own children.  The one person he doesn’t flip flop on?  President Vladimir Putin.  So what the hell is going on?

7.Earlier we mentioned North Koreas allies, which is important..  Who benefits from these Geopolitical decisions?  Because it definitely isn’t the US overall.

8. The United States has soft power all over the globe.  Its one of the great benefits of the Post WWII order, which the US directed.  America has “800 military bases in more than 70 countries and territories” \[[https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/us-military-bases-around-the-world-119321](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/us-military-bases-around-the-world-119321)\]

9. Directly after Trump met face to Face with Kim he decided to cut off War Games with South Korea in the Korean peninsula, citing costs.  Trump seems to believe that saving money is more important than having a military presence in one of the nations most contested sea beds.  Just south of the Korean peninsula, in the South China Sea the Chinese have an unprecedented presence.  They have been creating entire islands in order to have more control over the vital commerce and shipping done by ship.   After World War II the United states had near overt control of the oceans and shipping lanes; something never accomplished by any other nation in history.  So why would the United States jeopardize this accomplishment?

10.  The winners here are many but not the United States.  China, South Korea, Japan, Russia and North Korea all gain wins from Trumps meeting with Kim.  Here is how:

11. China, Russia and North Korea gain a win by seeing the presence of the American military vanish.  In turn the Us military gets hit by losing a close vantage point where they can watch North Korea and China, while helping allies S. Korea and Japan.  America has more warships than any nation combined; even one of these vessels deters aggression in the region.  This sea is also close to Russia, who would like to see American warships vanish.  Trump thinks it’s a waste of money and wants to pull them out.  We’ll see.  

12.  However the world becomes a winner if the negative warmongering rhetoric and threats go away.  If Trump succeeds in getting North Korea to denuclearize it is a grand win for the World. 

13.  Lets tally up the geopolitical score here.  Putin wins in a few ways.  They see an ally of theirs \[N. Korea\] get brought up to the world stage by meeting face to face with the leader of the free world.  They get respect and confirmation from the American president and one of their biggest parties, the GOP, that the Crimea takeover was legitimate; and they get American soft power removed from the Korean peninsula.  China also wins in these ways.  North Korea now looks levelheaded and willing to bring themselves into the fold of the global  order.  South Korea wins because this opens the field to possible reunification.  The capital of South Korea is 60 miles from the border with the north.  South Koreans have lived under the threat of bombardment of artillery and even worse: possible nuclear weapons.  Japan also wins in this way.  America wins if the North Korean threats are squashed for good, but only time will tell.  It’s a gamble but for a president who hasn’t been able to court any domestic wins overtly, it does seem to be a win for him and his administration in a strange way, albeit a confusing one. 

Please correct me if Im wrong on any of my statements.  Im just trying to encourage discussion.

COMMENTS:
You are talking as if the US military left the peninsula. That didn't happen. Actually nothing happened except a kabuki dance performance for Trump supporters in the US.

>Its main allies are China, who acts like a big brother, and Russia. Russia doesn’t affiliate themselves with too much with North Korea, but some speculate Russia helped North Korea obtain nuclear capabilities more quickly. They share a small border as well.

So the speculations revolved around [Russian scientists supporting DPRK's nuclear and missile programs in the 90's](https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-scientists-north-korea-newest-missile-designs-2018-1) and [DPRK's ICBM efforts being traced to a Ukrainian facility \(with ties to Russia through the Black Sea Fleet\)](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/world/asia/north-korea-missiles-ukraine-factory.html). The Russian government doesn't seem to have much to do with it, and has been fairly critical of DPRK's nuclear/missile programs. I think most importantly DPRK's nuclear program destabilizes the region and encourages proliferation, which harms Russia's national security and status as one of the few nuclear powers.

Russia does try to establish itself in others ways, like when it forgave 90% of DPRK in exchange for energy/education/health investments or [when it didn't enforce various sanctions on them](http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2018/171&referer=/english/&Lang=E). But these are far from substantial ties that one would expect from allies (significant military cooperation, intel sharing, etc.). It appears more as bilateral cooperation on specific issues rather than an alliance, just like Russia+Iran.

>They see an ally of theirs [N. Korea] get brought up to the world stage by meeting face to face with the leader of the free world. They get respect and confirmation from the American president and one of their biggest parties, the GOP, that the Crimea takeover was legitimate; and they get American soft power removed from the Korean peninsula.

Think this is jumping the gun. Russia is not an ally of DPRK and doesn't necessarily even want them to benefit from this whole fiasco. Russia wants to use this to make themselves relevant on the national stage, as if this were the Concert of Europe again. 

From this issue, little changes about the American perception of Russia. Russia intervening will have little effect on the outcome of the talks, barring some sort of extraordinary event. Even if they did, I think the non-Trump GOP would be reticent to improve their views on Russia, much less capitulate on Crimea and be seen as feckless and weak compared to the Democrats. Remember that even Trump disingenuously claims to be tougher on Russia than Obama (his base doesn't care, but NeverTrump GOPers and independents do). As Republicans have historically been perceived as "tougher" on foreign policy or at least wanted to, such a capitulation would be a high-profile event that would undermine that point.

>The goal is to get NK to join the US's sphere of influence, that way reunification with NK can proceed without significant interference from China (and maybe Russia).

If you can find a single reputable author who shares this opinion, I'll give you a cookie for the effort.
---
Trump is on public record explicitly stating in no uncertain terms he wants to pull out all US troops from Korean peninsula in the long term to save the costs.

Now, we can leave it up to the readers what is meant by saving the costs and let them make their own informed opinion.

The world has changed dramatically since even a decade ago.
---
DJT's rhetoric against NK was a puppet show for the masses and international community so that they, and by extension we, cannot predict the administration's plans until its too late. Pompeo's secret meeting with KJU earlier this year sets up a diplomatic connection (and I think direct communication line too) between NK and the US without having official diplomatic relations. IMO, the US-NK summit and the US's currently nice attitude towards NK is the US giving an outstretched hand to NK. The goal is to get NK to join the US's sphere of influence, that way reunification with NK can proceed without significant interference from China (and maybe Russia). We'll see if NK takes that hand.

TITLE: What was Trump's rationale for withdrawing from JCPOA just before meeting Kim-Jong Un?

POST: I've heard people say the move only undermined trust in America's word at precisely the worst possible moment. But given the timing, was it not more likely a deliberate signal to NK that they had better be prepared to make the concessions necessary to convince Congress?

The worst possible outcome for the US would be a half-measure or incrementally implemented deal that relieves pressure on NK only for NK to renege and rebound in an even more powerful position in future. On the other hand, it would be difficult to demand to NK's faces, after their charm offensive and gestures of good faith, that they should give up everything before receiving anything.

Could it be that withdrawing from the JCPOA was intended to resolve this dilemma? When negotiating with NK, the Trump administration can now point to the failure of JCPOA as justification for pursuing nothing less than a treaty with Congress, and then to the inflexibility of Congress as justification for making heavy demands before giving any concessions.

The Trump administration can now credibly exhibit good faith and trust in NK's intentions by pointing to Congress as an unshakable reality/constraint both parties have to work under -- a kind of good-cop bad-cop situation.

Ultimately the JCPOA may have eliminated a middle-ground that was considered dangerous from the American perspective, but would have been difficult to avoid by persuasion/positive negotiation.

Any thoughts?

COMMENTS:
Trump said so himself, that he wants to undo the Obama legacy...the burden of proof would be on someone to show that these actions actually had any rationale to them beyond what trump has said with his own words in reference to his own actions.
---
You're discounting personal motivation because you dislike the idea. Geopolitics is dictated at its core by individuals. Individuals are not always rational. Donald Trump has a clear and established pattern of behavior tied to undoing Obama's legacy. Often, this seems to be the only motivator necessary for him to take action, and the JCPOA is a great example of that.

It's really tiresome how easy it is to predict when clicking on someone's username will reveal they're a contributor to T_D. It's very easy to tell when they accuse others of not contributing to a discussion when it's them making pointless, derailing comments without offering anything.
---
Opposite Obama.  His only real thinking is:  how can I undo Obama' legacy and policies.  That's not much thought beyond that.  Sad, but the evidence is there.
---
Why the aggression?  Let's not allow this sub to devolve into insults - clearheadedness always allows for better discussion.
Don't get mad at me, get mad at Trump - he's so unpredictable and opaque that not even other world leaders, with all the resources at their disposal, can make heads or tails of his intentions.  Therefore, it's quite difficult, impossible even, to have a discussion about any "grand strategy" the US may be employing.  

Edit: Still... it could be an interesting mental exercise, so BLCKFLG_media, why don't you give us your thoughts on the op's hypothesis?

TITLE: North Korea’s Kim Jong-un in China for two-day trip ‘to brief Xi Jinping on Donald Trump summit’

COMMENTS:
SS: despite what some Western and South Korean pundits say that China is sidelined or marginalized, Kim is paying a very public trip to Beijing to brief Xi Jinping on the Trump summit.

Three trips to China within three months, that is very frequent. Also, I don't see how Trump can follow thru with NK denuclearization while antagonizing China. It's clear all roads in East Asia leads to Beijing and Trump is picking a wrong fight at the wrong time.
---
America's unipolar moment is ending.  The Chinese pole is forming right before our eyes.  Even when the 6-party talks were active, China never had this degree of influence over the Korean peninsula.
---
As you mentioned, Xi and Abe getting closer together.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/japan-views-china-as-ally-in-trump-trade-fight-1529336612?mod=mhp

“I want to lift up the Japan-China relationship to a new stage,” Mr. Abe said at a news conference this month, describing a May visit to Japan by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang as “an important first step toward a dramatic improvement.”

This month, Mr. Abe’s office published in its official magazine an article by Australian National University scholar Shiro Armstrong arguing China needs to be part of Tokyo’s effort to patch together a global free-trading system in the U.S.’s absence.

“The Asian region and the global economy have relied on American leadership, but now it is necessary for Asia to step up,” wrote Mr. Armstrong. “China, though it may seem unlikely, will be a critical partner.”

In an interview, Mr. Armstrong said Tokyo needed a “hedge against Trump.”
---
China being sidelined? If North Korea were to lay down it’s weapons and pacify, China would effectively becomes its sole protector militarily speaking. North Korea being the only geological barrier keeping other nations and their forces a respectable distance away from Beijing this is sure to happen. The DRPK -China link is a lifeline not a sideline.

 It could probably be argued there is even a significance between the timing of Xi Jinping success at removing the constitutional limit to his term in office and DRPK pressing ahead with international peace talks. With a greater probability of a friendly administration standing behind them in Beijing emboldening, making use of the’Xi era’ right from the beginning is an ideal time to press forward.
---
Oh no!  America can’t possibly let Asian countries control Asia!  What craziness!  

In all seriousness, what right do we have to be imposing our will on that side of the world?  It’s time for us to butt out. Letting China-japan-SK-NK have some self determination is a GOOD thing.  Does it weaken American imperialism?  Sure. But that is also s GOOD thing.

TITLE: Russia May Build a Pipeline Through North Korea After Donald Trump's Kim Jong Un Meeting

COMMENTS:
I think the moral argument is that NK shouldn't be able to interact with other countries normally when it is so abhorrent internally. It's arguable whether that policy is helpful to the people who are actually suffering, but there is definitely some controversy.
---
It's not just a pipeline, I believe the Russians are salivating over the possibility of connecting their rail system through NK to SK. Of course since the rail system like track width is different between the countries (as far as I'm aware this is the case), there will likely be lots of technical difficulty in actually achieving it.

Say, in the unlikely event of SK and Japan building an underground tunnel between them, combined with SK to Russian rail system being connected, you can quite possibly take a train from Sapporo, Japan and get off at London, UK. Well, at least theoretically. Probably will never happen I guess.
---
>Of course since the rail system like track width is different between the countries (as far as I'm aware this is the case), there will likely be lots of technical difficulty in actually achieving it.

Both Koreas use standard gauge and there is [dual gauge in the Russo-Korean border zone](http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/infrastructure/single-view/view/north-korea-rail-link-completed.html).

Yep. But keep in mind South Korea has to import its energy, but it is quite energy-efficient...had to learn how. Remember, North Korea has all the natural resources. The South Korean economy is energy-dependent. One could say its democracy is energy-dependent.

TITLE: Around the halls: Brookings experts react to the Trump-Kim Jong-un summit in Singapore

COMMENTS:
Usually big meetings happen at the end of the long negotiations. This is basically signing of letter of intent.

In the previous Trump China visit everything discussed in China was forgotten by Trump when his plane landed in DC. 

I don't think Pompeo has support needed to negotiate the real deal. Trump has different ideas week from now and different factions in  WH fight for the meaning of what was agreed.

Let's wait and see.
---
More or less agree.  There's not much meat here and the surprise cancellation of exercises might not be well received in South Korea and Japan.  I'm not convinced the DPRK will ever really give up their nukes, but if the US leaves Korea then it is plausible.  I think the bigger question now is how Japan is going to proceed as South Korea has been less than enthusiastic about confronting China for a while.  The US pulling back from Korea would make Japan the frontline and for the moment Japan is firmly pro-US entrenchment, a US pullout might force them to take a conciliatory stance with China.

It's certainly enough to cement their position and it would be foolish for people to assume that their missiles won't work. Strategically they have everything they need.

TITLE: North Korea's Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump sign denuclearisation agreement in Singapore

COMMENTS:
A document that lacks substance. Looks like a rehash of the 1994 agreement between the Clinton administration and North Korea. 

North Korea is the big winner here, and they got what they wanted - being seen as equals with the United States.
---
That agreement lacks a lot of substance and amount mostly to a declaration of intention of working toward denuclearization in the future. In a sense it's pretty similar to the Panmunjom Declaration: No mention of timetable or any check of any sort.

in exchange of which Kim got:

-The international stature he so desperately wanted all these years. That can't be taken back.

-A good leverage on Trump as mid term approaches 

As for China, i'm not sure to which extent they're involved here but it's entirely possible they just immunized themselves to Trump's trade war for a while. something to the extent:

"We give you the big, shiny but ultimately hollow diplomatic success you crave for with Kim and in exchange you cease your trade war threats on us. If you resume them, Kim is going to resume his threats too "

Color me skeptical on that deal.
---
Winner winner chicken dinner.  

Though I don't think "being seen as equals" was the goal. IMO the US establishment overestimates the importance of its legitimacy granting powers. For that matter it overestimates the importance of de jure statehood within the international system. See also: the mental gymnastics of not calling Islamic state a state.   

What NK gets (much like 94') is a period of a few years where they get their strategic and economic goals before someone figures out they're not keeping their end of the bargain. There's already a thread in /r/investing about "North Korea what if's". I'm sure some speculators (American's and others) are lining up to get in on the ground floor of what they imagine will be a rapid growth market. The very act of declaring peace fills their coffers. There's already talk of US withdrawing from SK. Who knows how many tangible benefits NK will get before the gig is up.   

Rinse and repeat every 1.5 decades when the US electorate forgets why it is we don't try to negotiate with NK.
---
Didn't Trump just give up military drills for literally nothing?
---
That argument hasn't held any weight since 1991, when the US pulled out the last of its nuclear weapons on the peninsula--the only real bed-shitting in regard to the armistice agreement. Meanwhile, if you're actually interested in being fair, North Korea:    

1) invaded another sovereign nation  
2) tried to assassinate a South Korean head of state and instead killed the first lady  
3) built an extensive network of tunnels that encroach the sovereign territory of another nation  
4) murdered US servicemen on a routine and legal watch in the DMZ  
5) attacked and captured a US vessel in international waters  
6) abducted dozens of citizens of two US mutual defense treaty nations  
7) tortured imprisoned US and ROK citizens  
8) sank a South Korean naval vessel, killing 46 sailors  
9) shelled a South Korean island, killing 2 soldiers and 2 civilians 

10) shot ballistic missiles over the air space of a mutual defense treaty nation--repeatedly  
11) engaged in a long pattern of openly threatening  a mutual defense treaty nation and directing belligerent rhetoric against the US    
  
When the US removed those weapons they made a move towards righting past wrongs and resolving the issue. The North moved in the opposite direction. This is not comparable bed-shitting.

This isn’t a side effect of NK gaining respect or legitimacy in the international community due to its nuclear weapons program. The Russians have an interest in resolving the crisis on the Korean Peninsula. They, like the US and SK, are trying to coax NK to denuclearize in order to open up their economy to outside investment. They’re dangling economic incentives in Kim’s face. Russia has been tilting to Asia since the West enacted sanctions on her for the 2014 invasion of Crimea. Russia is very interested in developing overland infrastructure from Russia to SK. This will allow Russia to further develop the sparsely populated and underdeveloped Russian Far East. Russia’s is a commodity exporter, SK is a commodity importer. The Russians also see opportunities for tapping into NK’s vast mineral wealth. For the Russians it’s largely economic. Plus they would prefer a denuclearized NK, to maintain stability as well as a buffer state on the peninsula, and to reduce the presence of US forces in the region.

Only geostrategic countries with powerful backers can achieve this (North Korea and Iran) backed by China and Russia.

TITLE: The case for Russian engagement in the Korean peninsula

POST: The case for Russian engagement in the Korean peninsula

Submission Statement:

Russia is today a "former" great power trying to restore its past glory. Yet, they are hindered by demographic, economic and political difficulties which are hard to overcome. They are aging fast, they are dying fast and they have enemies everywhere. Some western analysts are saying that China and Russia are getting closer than ever, and that it is a big threat which needs to be addressed. They are correct to a certain degree. But they need to realize that Russia is actually more afraid of China than Europe or the USA. They share a massive land-border and if Russia fails to modernize its economy, they will become essentially a vassal state to China. The recent Sino-Russian alignment is nothing but the result of immediate concerns and has no solid foundation. The real big player and threat is China. Therefore, I would like to argue that Russia must be lured to our side by providing her with tangible benefits, and Korea could play a key role in making that happen. 

First, it is necessary to note that the "Korean Question" is one of the most crucial flashpoints in East Asia. North Korea must be restrained but they won't unless they get something in return. However, last year has been a phase of great pacification by giving momentum to diplomacy and negotiations. Now, the US and North Korea are vying for some kind of compromise. In the process, South Korea has repeatedly advocated for a Russian engagement. We have made explicit our plans for railroads and pipelines. So, what does this mean?

South Korea is the second largest importer of natural gas in the world. Russia needs to diversify its customer base. They are almost entirely relying on Western Europe and their relations are sour at best. South Korea can provide cash for oil/gas and we can invest in Russia to build factories and create jobs. On the other hand, Korea can make its industry more competitive by lowering energy costs and therefore generating more wealth for the country. Should South Korea become richer and stronger, we could afford to pay more for US forces and we could buy more US weapons.

South Korea can serve as a gateway for Russia for foreign markets too. Russia's Far East will have more jobs and more factories, more goods. We will bring them via railway to our markets and we can re-export them to the outer world. 

If Russia gets a regular continous and reliable source of income by establishing closer connection with South Korea, by having North Korea as a road, then Russia will have more than enough incentives to restrain North Korea's behavior. Russia has a land-border with North Korea, and Russia has the willpower to engage militarily if a third-rate power crosses in their path. 

A Russo-Korean (South) cooperation with the benediction of the US will serve as a good encircling web against China. It will enrich South Korea, it will enrich (to a certain degree) Russia and reduce their dependency of China, it will restrain North Korea by making them content to have a rent revenue. All the parties involved would be satisfied and reduce the risks of armed conflict. Therefore, I'd argue that South Korea needs a new Nordpolitik focusing on Russia, and that the US/EU should seek a rapprochement with Russia to counterbalance the immense threat that China poses to the whole world.

COMMENTS:
The establishment balked at Trump's rapprochement, not because it is populated by anachronistic Cold Warriors, but because the Trump Administrations lack of understanding, or interest in understanding, why the US-NK relationship is the way it is.  Nobody doesn't want peace and prosperity, but that is easier said than done.

For starters there is a lot of legitimate greivence between the two because of the Korean War (1950s, not 1980s).  It ended in a bloody stalemate, and nearly in nuclear war (MacArthur was muzzled before nuking NK and China, which he badly wanted to do).  The North Koreans have spent three quarters of a century painting the Americans as something akin to the Antichrist, and is unlikely to treat a negotiation with anything less than cynical skepticism.  There is also the not small issue of NK having nuclear weapons and little investment in the stability of the world order, and a potential willingness/financial need to sell those weapons to geopolitical actors should the opportunity arise.  As James Mattis put it, "we're there to prevent World War 3.". Whether or not that's true, most of the establishment legitimately feels that way.  And they may not be wrong.

There is a delicate geopolitical balance of power in the region in which, curiously, every major actor involved *benefits* from.  The North Korean regime has an implacable foe to justify it's draconian Juchii philosophy, and make themselves a useful tool of leverage for China when it's dealing with the US.  China gets a buffer state between it and US forces/allies in SK and Japan, and gets a convenient lever in negotiations (as the only one who can really influence NK).  South Korea gets a foe to justify military spending, tight government controls, etc.  Japan's nationalist movement gets a regular supply of errant missiles to justify the rebuilding of it's military.  The US gets another unrelenting foil for it's defense industry, for politicians, and a lever when dealing with China.  Russia gets a situation that it can meddle in (or not) as a lever against the US, a small buffer to distract China, and a lot of cheap labor in Siberia.  Why would anyone in the region actually *want* to upend this balance of power?

Few notes for OP:
Russia is not interested in World hegemony - as a State we have a lot of internal issues that must be solved in next decades. Also not enough human resources and infrastructure.

That "Russian Meddling" was presented as something enormous and menacing but amount of "meddling" ads is so pathetic in comparison with amount of US money that were spended at election campaigns so i still have no clue how it was possible to affect even few thousands of US voters. 

All i can see that US and Europe is destabilising themselves due to their own incompetence and blaming Russians and omnipotent Putin in everything. It's sort of annoying. Russia have no resourses to maintain operations of SUCH scale. 

About China - Russia is not interested to limit Chinese influence in any way. Just deal with it, it's not our headache. But Russia is interested to diversify it's economic ties and have good relations with other Asian countries (Japan and South Korea most interesting for Russia i assume) and do not depend only at China. So solution of NK problem is interesting as a huge potential for developing our Far East regions and reduced tensions in this region.
---
It is really sad actually. Russia's economy is just 1/15th of America's. As a great power vying for world hegemony, they are almost irrelevant. Their total GDP is even less than South Korea's, and nobody thinks of South Korea as a GREAT POWER. Russia's influence is disruptive at best, but they do not pose a strategic danger. On the other hand, China is the big guy which must be reckoned with. Their economic power even surpasses anything the USSR had ever achieved during their heydays. Russian specialists such as Stephen Kotkin have already stressed this point. I think Stephen Walt had said something similar. Russian intrusion in American domestic politics is indeed heinous and provocative, but that is it. A little nuisance, but no more. Russia is NOT a BIG THREAT to America anymore. Something irritable yes, but dangerous? not really. But letting Russia join China and letting Russia become a vassal to China, that is dangerous.
---
Trump tried the reproachment path and was castigated for it, the US establishment (aka deep state for the conspiracy minded) had kittens and practically rebelled. 

I'm not saying you are wrong, just you have to leave the US out of the equation since I cannot see them coming to the party, at least until after everyone born before 1980 dies. The anti communist propaganda still resonates loudly even with no USSR
---
Your claim that the far east of Russia will be in all annexed in the next century is just fantasy. Predicting more than 100 years in the future is fun, but do not expect any of it to happen. A hundred years ago Russia was a country tearing itself apart with a plummeting development and loss industry and territory. From there only 50 years later they turned out to be a super power, of the two super powers then in the world. So in 50 years from now China and Russia could be warring states, in civil wars or part of the same or different economic unions.

&#x200B;

The Russian economy had an average growth rate of 1.8% since 2010 and the population has also increased since that period (0.30%). On the other hand if the Chinese can get better salaries in China, the migrant flow might reverse. Since the Chinese have also very little population growth might that mean that Russia might annex parts of north China?

TITLE: What is the applicability of Mearsheimer’s views, if any, to Taiwan or the Korean peninsula, both of which he points out might be causes of war between the PRC and the U.S.?

COMMENTS:
The US isn't going to war over Taiwan. Period. It won't happen. Chinese policy towards Taiwan has shifted from militaristic to purchasing media and spreading influence with the ultimate goal of doing basically what it did to Hong Kong. It's a slow, patient, long-term game.

Taiwan is long past the point where it could have hoped for the votes in the UN for internationally-recognized independence.
---
The bulk of HK was UK (permanent) territory, including the Hong kong Island. Leased part is the area known as New Territories.
---
Think about it this way. The US is the one that multiple times sabotaged and stopped the Taiwan nuclear program. The US wouldnt even let Taiwan have independence at a cost of free. Are they going to now spend treasure and blood to give them independence?
---
All countries strive to achieve regional hegemony. Within the framework of the Mearsheimer theory, world hegemony is impossible.

All countries that achieve regional hegemony try to prevent all others from doing the same, or they would upset their own regional hegemony.

Taiwan and South Korea are 2 of many allies the US is boosting to prevent China from obtaining regional hegemony.

If Korea reunified, it would certainly become a Chinese ally, so it's not in the US's interest to destroy North Korea or to make South-North relations better. Meanwhile, it is in China's interests to peacefully reunify Korea.

** In no way am I saying Mearsheimer is completely right.
---
> Chinese policy towards Taiwan has shifted from militaristic to purchasing media and spreading influence with the ultimate goal of doing basically what it did to Hong Kong.

Except that Hong Kong was always on a timer because it was a 99 yr lease and China wasn't willing to renew it. 

But I agree with you that the US probably won't get into a war over Taiwan.

TITLE: Prediction: End Outcome of Korean Peninsula Crisis of 2017-2019

POST: Prediction:

1. **NK will be a defacto nuclear power** just as Pakistan, Israel, and India have been.
   1. **Trump will publically declare he is "satisfied" with NK's progress to "denuclearize"** with an illusion of results (e.g. *site destruction, ceasing missile/nuke test, ceasing enrichment/missile construction, token UN inspections, commitment to draw down nuclear arsenal, draw down of NK troops along DMZ*)
2. **US will give "security guarantees" in the form of a Peace treaty** to formally replace the Korean war armistice
   1. Trump publicly heralds the result as "*truly historic and unprecedented*", bipartisan approval cementing his political legacy; **Trump Secures re-election in 2020 on basis of "Peace Treaty"**
3. **SK will see to it that NK's economy improves**, to ensure that NK doesn't collapse and overrun SK with refugees with immediate unification.
   1. **SK is adamantly anti-war; seeks to uplift NK economy to modernity** before entering into **'soft-unification'** via union or confederation in long term.
4. China and Russia will push for **partial UN sanction relief** for NK economy to keep NK econom afloat.
5. **Japan continues military re-militarization** due to private concerns of US defense commitments and strategic focus in East Asia.

In the very very long term:

* Trump has publically stated his intention to **eventually withdraw US troops from Korean peninsula** due to significant costs of stationing troops in Korea. (Translation: Peace with Honor)
* There will be some **marginal probability future conflict** as the two Korea determine who will control the entire peninsula in 100-200 years.

COMMENTS:
This prediction is relying a lot on Trump getting reelected
---
Yeah really not sure how a korean peace treaty "secures re-election." Not sure that's even in the top 20 issues of any meaningful part of the US electorate. Plus yes, it would certainly be great for his legacy, but expecting bipartisan approval for anything Trump does in the current political climate seems a bit unlikely.
---
The US hasn’t made it a decade without a recession since 1850. I don’t think Trumps tariffs are exactly positioned to be super helpful either.
---
If it makes it I think he’ll get re-elected but I doubt it’ll be easy under any case. Do you have a source for that approval rating? Pretty much all the ones I hear have it in lower 40’s sometimes climbing towards 45.
---
Look how fast SK and Japan subscribed to Iran oil sanctions. Their export-economy wouldn't last a day if they tried to go nuclear, the world-wide sanctions would cripple SK economy.

TITLE: What does the "complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" mean for South Korea?

POST: Lost in all the media coverage was the phrase "complete denuclearization of the **Korean Peninsula**". South Korea uses nuclear energy to power their economy. The USA undoubtedly has nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula or off its coast. 

What does this all mean for South Korea and the USA going forward?

Source: http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/06/12/trump-kim-jong-un-sign-comprehensive-document-vague-on-specific-details.html

COMMENTS:
Reality: Past promises of denuclearization include [1992 treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Declaration_of_the_Denuclearization_of_the_Korean_Peninsula) that allowed nuclear energy. Also include [2005 agreement](https://www.state.gov/p/eap/regional/c15455.htm) that included nuclear energy for North Korea being recognized.

Opinion: South Korea likely to be able to retain nuclear energy. North Korea likely as well in any deal if one is possible, but with limits on program. Limits and safeguards remain to be determined, if ever.

>The USA undoubtedly has nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula 

Reality: US deployed nuclear weapons to SK in 1950s, [removed in 1991 under President H.W. Bush](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00963402.2017.1388656). US has nuclear weapons capable of striking NK as mentioned through use of submarines and bombers. These travel, but submarines with nuclear weapons returned to Western Pacific only recently in 2016 for port visit, with visit to Guam. Bombers with nuclear capability based out of Guam, not Japan or South Korea. US nuclear weapons are not close to coast of N. Korea, but rely on long range of strategic bombers, submarines, and ICBMs for deterrence. Lack of port visits in Western Pacific does not mean lack of submarine patrols near NK, but extent is unclear.
---
It means a nuclear\-weapons free Korean Peninsula.

>But against all that backdrop comes this piece of eye\-opening news, from NBC: “[North Korea](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/) has expressed its commitment to ‘complete denuclearization’ of the Korean peninsula and is not seeking conditions, South Korean President Moon Jae\-in said on Thursday, as the United States vowed to maintain ‘maximum pressure’ on Pyongyang.”  
>  
>Moon went on to assure that the upcoming summit would likely bring normalized relations between the two Koreas and the United States, something that hasn’t been seen — umm, ever.  
>  
>“I don’t think denuclearization has different meanings for South and [North Korea](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/),” he went on, NBC News [reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korea-willing-accept-complete-denuclearization-without-conditions-moon-says-n867421?cid=public-rss_20180419). “The North is expressing a will for a complete denuclearization. They have not attached any conditions that the U.S. cannot accept, such as the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea. All they are talking about is the end of hostile policies against [North Korea](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/), followed by a guarantee of security.”

---
Well, that remains to be seen. [Quoting from the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/jun/12/trump-and-kim-document-analysis-singapore-agreement-denuclearisation):

> This is the most critical, and easily the most problematic, of the leaders’ statements. It does not meet Washington’s long-stated goal of complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement (CVID) of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, but simply restates Kim’s position after his summit with Moon.

> No serious analysts expected the North Korean leader to commit to CVID in his first meeting with Trump. That process – if it happens at all – could take years and cost billions of dollars.

> It also fails to define what is meant by denuclearisation. In Washington, it requires Kim to abandon his nuclear ambitions. But the North Korean interpretation is more complicated. The regime believes it should include the withdrawal of the US nuclear umbrella from South Korea, possibly including the withdrawal of all 28,500 US troops ranged along the South’s border with the North.

> As the Atlantic Council’s Alexander Vershbow said, it comes down to the difference between the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and the denuclearisation of North Korea.

In general, international treaties quite often employ intentionally vague terms to get some result, even if it remains to be seen what this some result means exactly. Another examples would be the "one China" policy of the US and the "two state solution" in the near east peace process.
---
Why wasn’t the agreement more specific? It seems quite vague, almost deliberately so. The North Korean hardliners are going to take it literally.
---
>Why wasn’t the agreement more specific?

It was a short summit. Later negotiations are supposed to deliver details.

>The United States and the DPRK commit to hold follow\-up negotiations, led by the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and a relevant high\-level DPRK official, at the earliest possible date, to implement the outcomes of the U.S.\-DPRK summit.

>The North Korean hardliners are going to take it literally.

IIRC that it is arguable a concession to the North Koreans.

Americans demanded a complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea.

TITLE: The Korean Peninsula: Three Dangerous Scenarios

COMMENTS:
Page 9 lists their estimated Long Range artillery units in service. This is really good as I hadn't seen an updated list in a while, can't find the report for some reason, but I think it was around 2010 and it estimated they had something like 700 koksan guns and some 500 MRL systems. Seem they have the rocket systems around a similar number, but do a good job of breaking down the M1991 and the single use  KN-02 which is basiclly a copied [OTR-21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OTR-21_Tochka) short range ballistic missile. This is also the first estimate I've seen of how many KN-09 MRL (the 300m MRL mentioned in the chart) systems they have in service, which is actually a lot less than I suspected they'd have. I was under the impression they had begun production in early 2015, but it appears they weren't actually being put into service until 2016, but sub 50 units is still really low, and this whole things seems to show their koksan guns having much lower numbers. 

They don't break down their 250k casualty number beyond [citing this 2006 report](http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=1865). the numbers I've seen have been less than 200,000 mostly because the 2010 Island shelling, in which Koksan artillery guns were used, showed us that NK projectiles had something like a 30% failure rate upon impact, which is a very important thing when factoring in their ROF. Again though, this was a long time ago and didn't account for the increased population growth to the North of Seoul which is an important factor. 

I guess a good TlDr of this is that while it would surely be the largest death toll as the result of an acute strike the modern world has ever seen, it's far from turning korea into a sea of fire. And as the piece points out, wouldn't really be that good of a stratedgy. 

> Alternatively, North Korea might seek to minimize escalation
risk and limit the attrition rate of its long-range artillery by firing
only a limited number of salvos each day, while still maximizing
the political effect by extending attacks over a longer time horizon
and counting on their remaining capacity to dramatically
increase attack intensity to deter an asymmetric allied response
(e.g., decapitation strikes on North Korea). For instance, if North
Korea had 100 240-mm MRLs within range of Seoul, each
day they could have five MRLs shoot one volley of 110 rockets.
Even if all were destroyed after firing, the DPRK could sustain
this rate of fire for 20 days. Because the open-source estimates
indicate that North Korea possesses more than 10,000 artillery
systems south of the Pyongyang-Wonsan line, this strategy could
be pursued almost indefinitely. The 2006 conflict between Israel
and Hezbollah demonstrated the disproportionate political
effect that even quite limited rocket strikes on civilian targets
can have.

From actual experts I've talked to this would likely be the scenario in a NK strike, where they try to weather the likely air and long range strikes along the DMZ while launching these kind of attacks, along with more targeted strikes on things like military bases.
---
The Department of Defence estimated that a North Korean artillery barrage could inflict 250,000 casualties on Seoul alone. This paper has lots of juicy infographics that I'm sure you'll enjoy \- exploring a few dangerous scenarios on the Korean Peninsula.

>This perspective summarizes detailed analytical work on the implications of a large, survivable North Korean nuclear force; the challenges of North Korean artillery that can threaten Seoul from the Kaesong Heights; and the issues attendant to a potential mission to secure loose nuclear weapons after a North Korean collapse. We analyze the risks of each contingency on its own as well as how they might interact with one another to create exceptionally dangerous, operationally demanding scenarios. Our work suggests that these three major challenges are complicated by two others—the logistical burden and local chaos of a noncombatant evaluation operation and the potential for third\-party intervention, especially by China. Our most important finding is that the United States must develop and work with regional allies to shape a wider range of potential diplomatic and military options to deal with North Korea. This conclusion creates particular implications for the Army, as the core missions involved—including deterring a major war, conducting intensive operations short of major war, and securing weapons of mass destruction in the event of instability—will place massive, perhaps unsustainable, demands on Army capacity and specific high\-demand, low\-density capabilities. The Army, together with senior Department of Defense and U.S. government leaders, must rethink fundamental assumptions about the strategies and concepts the United States would use in Korean contingencies.
---
I find it highly unlikely that most of the population would not be evacuated within the first 48 hours.  Which is why the 30-50k estimates from other think tanks seem more reasonable to me.  Additionally, day/night cycle visibility and general targeting will be a problem for them, even without any kind of denial attempt by their adversaries.  Beyond the technical issues with the platforms, low morale and insufficient training will be huge factors for a military that lacks automaticity.

Now, if they slime ports like Incheon, nuke AFBs, or if unfavorable weather conditions better disperse sarin gas, the second order casualties could be extremely high, due to lack of HADR access and the general logistical disfunction of the greater urban area after the shelling events on Seoul.  Starvation, disease, etc could be the real killer.  That makes the 250k DoD figure sound more reasonable.

TITLE: Peace Prevails in Pyongyang as Korean Leaders Take Destiny Into Their Own Hands

COMMENTS:
The leaders of both Korean states, Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in have signed a joint statement in Pyongyang recently. The statement represents the most specific agreement to-date within the context of the ongoing Korean peace process. In the joint statement, Kim and Moon resolved to work cooperatively to accomplish the following:

> - **Withdraw the armed forces of both Korean states from the De-militarised zone (DMZ)**

> - **Disarm all guards stationed at the Panmunjom truce village**

> - **Create an 80 kilometre zone in the Yellow Sea and Sea of Japan to be free from any and all military exercises and manoeuvres** 

> - **Dismantle the Tonchkhan-ni rocket launching site in the DPRK under international supervision** 

> - **Disarm the DPRK’s nuclear reactor at Yonbyon according to the terms agreed upon at the DPRK-US Singapore summit**

> - **A united Korea team to participate in the 2020 Olympics** 

> - **Proffer a bid for both Korean states to jointly host the 2032 Olympic Games** 

While the joint statement did not specifically mention the preparation for a treaty to formally end the war between Pyongyang and Seoul, according to a South Korean official,

*“Leaders of the South and the North have in fact announced the end of the war on the Korean Peninsula by their agreements”*

Currently, the border between the two Koreas on the 38th parallel is the most militarised border in the world, but if the terms of the joint statement of Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in are implemented, it would represent the most viably significant de-escalation of tension in the inter-Korean war since the Armistice of 1953. In this sense, de-militarising the confusingly named “de-militarised zone” on the 38th parallel is a key step towards bringing an end to the war, even more so than fulfilling the demands for DPRK de-nuclearisation.
---
At this moment, I would daresay the geopolitical relationship between China and the US is worse than the NK-South Korea relationship, in terms of economic and military tensions, public opinion, government policy and possibility of going to war (Over Taiwan)
---
Absolutely, and this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone; the relationship between *competing superpowers is also significantly more difficult to navigate than compared to two sibling states that formed from the ashes of a previously unified state.
---
> The age of the useful land buffer states is long gone.

Tell that to Ukraine.
---
> buffer States

The age of the useful land buffer states is long gone.

I do agree that inter Korean relationship can be influenced by US or China, but they are on the same page at least. What i am saying is that it's much easier for the Koreas to end the hostilities between themselves (and guarantee some security as well for both) than for the expanding security dilemma and rising regional  competition to end between China and the U.S

TITLE: North Korea nuclear deal: US attitude 'regrettable', says Pyongyang

COMMENTS:
SS: Shortly after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Pyongyang to discuss the much anticipated "Nuclear Deal" with North Korean officials, an unnamed North Korean foreign ministry official "branded the US attitude at the latest talks over its nuclear programme 'regrettable'". This directly contradicts with Pompeo's own statements that his visit had resulted in "a great deal of progress" in some areas. 

This criticism by the North Koreans directed at the US could indicate their unwillingness to commit to denuclearization. Despite the meeting between Trump and Kim resulting in some form of agreement, it didn't provide concrete steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea. As discussed by many members here in this forum, North Korea is unlikely to give up the weapons they have tried to develop for much of their existence, nuclear weapons provide guarantees of security and sovereignty that protect them against US aggression. A meeting and photo op with Trump may have given Kim confidence that his state is now respected internationally, and any aggression towards his regime from the Americans would reflect poorly on the perception of Trumps diplomatic abilities, both domestically and abroad. Furthermore, North Korea feels bolstered by renewed Chinese support, Kim has met with Xi Jinping multiple times in recent months and the Chinese media is portraying a good relationship between the two leaders.

Will the relationship between the US and North Korea continue to deteriorate as the positions of each remain incompatible? If a resumption of aggressive rhetoric occurs, relations could spiral downwards rapidly as seen earlier this year. The only difference now is that Kim may have broader support amongst the international community and its key partners China and Russia. With its gamble in Singapore and attacks on the Liberal international order, the US may find itself isolated should it resume threats towards North Korea.

Although known to the intelligence community, North Korea has active ballistic missile operating bases. This shows some of the latest imagery of one of these bases, Sakkanmol, and its facilities.

Any talks over denuclearization need to include the DPRK’s missile capabilities. There are 20 undisclosed bases in total. The government can close these facilities without denuclearizing. Under UN Security Council resolutions, they’re required to close the bases. They pose real operational threats to allied forces in South Korea and Japan.

DPRK has not even slightly resembled a communist state for two decades at least, the state itself has abandoned communism as its driving ideology, removing all mentions of the word from their constitution etc. in the early 2000s. 
DPRK follows an ideology of preservation and self interest of Kim Jong Un and those close to him. Honestly, its feudalism more than anything; Un is the king and his serfs and peasantry are given the minimum substance required for survival so they can spend their lives toiling away in support of his luxurious lifestyle...

TITLE: North Korea still taking baby steps with Kim's missile site offer

COMMENTS:
**Submission Statement::** This article talks about how efforts in inter-Korean relations are in stark contrast to the very little progress of actual denuclearisation.

Analysts are concerned and disappointed about the lack of evidence that shows any real effort by North Korea to denuclearize, “It’s worrying there was no mention of North Korea’s current missile and nuclear warhead stockpiles in the statement” as Nam Sung-wook, a professor of North Korean studies at Korea University, said.

In the same time, the government of Moon Jae-in faces domestic backlash for a newly started media-campaign with the goal [to soften citizens’ impression of North Korean dictator](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/19/ashamed-south-koreans-chilled-by-kim-jong-uns-cuddles), with many remaining sceptical of pandering to a brutal dictator.

Others described Kim's recent concessions as an effort to simply keep momentum going until he can sit down with Trump again. 
Actually, Moon will be trying to “persuade Trump to meet Kim halfway and continue nuclear talks”, during the next United Nations general assembly, at 25th September in New York.

TITLE: Possibility of North Korea shipping Nuclear Weapons and Ballistic Missiles to Countries such as Yemen, Syria and Iran?

Given the current sanctions on North Korea, what is their likelihood to trade nuclear weapons in exchange for undermining sanctions imposed on them, and getting economic benefits from countries which are not sanctioned or not as bad in a shape as North Korea. Such as Iran who has tons of oil to spare for example to North Korea.

Can North Korea deliver ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons to other countries and allow them to posses nuclear weapons?

COMMENTS:
There is another thread in this sub talking about that very report, and I found it to be low quality. [The writer Michelle Nichols](https://twitter.com/michellenichols/status/1025572934939811840) did not provide accurate information. And the misuse/abuse of grammatical tenses created very different understanding of the information, especially in the title. She seemed to suggest NK **continued** to do this and that **after the June 2018** meeting, but in the story the evidence provided were from 2016.

* *North Korea has not stopped its nuclear and missile program*. Since the report was for a 6 month period, we need to know exactly the date this conclusion was drawn. Trump and Kim met in June. The story seems to suggest NK continued to develop nuclear and missile after June. But it is not clear in the details.

* *defy Security Council resolutions through a massive increase in illicit ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products* The NK sanction does allow gas/oil trade with NK, with a limit. NK buying gas or oil is not a violation of the sanction unless the quota is exceeded.
 Here is the UN text:

> The Council further decided that all Member States would prohibit the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea of all refined petroleum products beyond 500,000 barrels during an initial period of three months — beginning on 1 October 2017 and ending on 31 December 2017 — and exceeding 2 million barrels per year during a period of 12 months beginning on 1 January 2018 and annually thereafter.  In addition, Member States would not supply, sell or transfer crude oil to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in excess of the amount supplied, sold or transferred by that State in the 12-month period prior to the adoption of today’s resolution

* *The U.N report said North Korea is cooperating militarily with Syria* Only the editor saw the UN report, she said:

> The experts said “prohibited military cooperation with the Syrian Arab Republic has continued unabated.” They said North Korean technicians engaged in ballistic missile and other banned activities have visited Syria in 2011, 2016 and 2017.

Is UN disallowing NK technician visit Syria? Can anyone tell me where this is from? This happened before the Trump/Kim meeting.

* *NK has been trying to sell weapons to Yemen’s Houthis* she said

> NK to supply conventional arms and ballistic missiles to Yemen’s Houthi group. A country, which was not identified, showed the experts a July 13, 2016 letter from a Houthi leader inviting the North Koreans to meet in Damascus

We should be aware of the alleged invitation to meet in Syria was in 2016. Two years before the Trump/Kim meeting. Houthi is not considered anti-America. In fact, Houthi is rather local to Yemen only. Are we going to assume Houthi wants to get nuclear weapons to attack Israel? that seems to be where she is hinting.

> They'll get caught in the act and fail to deliver. 

You are way too confident. US can't even seal off it's own border from drug smugglers, money launders, and bad hombres.  And these aren't even state-actors.
---
NK does not have many nuclear weapons to give. They can certainly supply missiles and stuff, i think. But then Russia and China will  help any adversaries of US with those.    

   However NK can supply  nuclear tech/infrastructure to places. I thought they already did this sometime before.
---
They'll get caught in the act and fail to deliver.

The only way would be is if Syria, Iran etc do it Pakistan style. Apparently,Pakistani PM Benazir managed to smuggle NK missiles from NK to PK using her diplomatic plane. 

I might be wrong on my history here so correct be if I'm wrong.

Seems clickbait though. The article described NK people visiting, or were invited to visit, Houthis and Syria in **2016**. Low quality journalism.
---
I wonder how long until Trump cuts loose on them again. I suspect he may he dissuaded by the fact that he harped on so much about how he basically solved the North Korea problem with one photo op with Kim and how he lavished praise on him. But as it becomes more evident he's been had for a fool he'll eventually have no choice but to start throwing twitter tantrums again.
---
Given that the so called "North Korea Deal" as between Trump's "administration" and North Korea was a sham, snare, and delusion... this comes to the surprise of exactly no one on earth other than the idiots in the White House.
---
They reported seeing a letter Houthi inviting Kim to meet in 2016. Not sure if it was actually delivered to Kim. And if it is, if Kim made the trip. **The story Houthi meeting Kim in Syria is like a movie script, not reasonable in any way.**

Then you want to accuse Kim sold weapons to Houthi after the Kim/Thrump meeting in 2018?
---
China and South Korea are adamantly against war on Korean peninsula. 

So Trump can do twitter tantrums all he wants, but everyone would know it's for domestic audience, not serious policy prescriptions, because if your strongest East Asian ally (SK) is heavily anti-war, then basically it's a no-go.

TITLE: North Korea to destroy Tongchang-ri Missile Test Site that Kim promised Trump during the summit

COMMENTS:
I remain very skeptical, if only for the fact that I just can never see the Kim regime actually surrendering the nuclear weapons in any capacity. This seems to me like a very easy, largely theater piece concession that doesn't really indicate any long-term commitment to denuclearization. Kim is just never going to surrender his state's actual nuclear capability. Why would he? He's seen what happens to other states that have abandoned or rejected their nuclear capacities (Libya and Ukraine stand out) and he's seen what saber-rattling with his nuclear arsenal gets him: An unprecedented seat at the table with the President of the US and concessions. If anything, this summit has made maintaining the nuclear arsenal more desirable to Kim, if only for its clear potential as a strong negotiation tool in addition to its security guarantee.
---
> The missile test site North Korean leader Kim Jong-un promised U.S. President Donald Trump to destroy is a large-scale facility in Tongchang-ri, North Pyongan Province. The regime conducted a vital test of an engine for intercontinental ballistic missiles there last year.

As MSM is quite silent on the actual follow ups after summit, I couldn't think of a better sub to post such relevant news for visibility. I think this is quite appropriate as opinions are divided on the outcome of the meeting and it is my believe that we'd be interested in keeping track of whether either side will keep their words. 

[As reported in a separate article, Kim promised the demolishing of this site as a surprise offer to Trump during the negotiations. This offer was especially appealing to Trump as this site is known as the testing ground for ICBMs that could potentially reach the mainland US.](http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2018/06/13/2018061300928.html)

Surprisingly, Kim is set to follow through with his promise. Regardless of bipartisan politics or opinion regarding what the meeting has achieved, this is undeniably a good, solid first step being taken by NK only 2 days after the summit.
---
"The President did reveal that Kim told him he had already destroyed a major missile engine site -- though it was not clear how significant this step was or how it could be verified."

https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/12/politics/what-really-came-out-of-the-trump-kim-summit/index.html

"But the future remains unclear -- the U.S. and North Korea did not reach any agreement on the details of how to achieve or verify that denuclearization, Mr. Trump said. "We'll be verifying," the president remarked in a rare, extended news conference after the summit. Mr. Trump also claimed Kim told him North Korea has destroyed a "major" missile testing site, although he didn't expand on that."

https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/trump-kim-conclude-historic-summit-in-singapore-live-updates-today-2018-06-12-live-updates/

"At a press conference after their meeting, Trump said Kim had agreed to destroy "a major missile engine testing site."

"That was not in your agreement," Trump told reporters. "I got that after we signed the agreement. I said, 'Do me a favor. You've got this missile engine testing site. We know where it is because of the heat.' It's incredible the equipment we have, to be honest with you. I said, 'Can you close it up?' He's going to close it up."

https://www.npr.org/2018/06/12/619247404/trump-says-north-korea-will-destroy-missile-site-but-which-one

It appears there has been reporting on Trump's report that Kim told him privately he would destroy a missile test site, but nothing on Chosun's more recent report that the Tongchang-ri is the one that will be destroyed.

Chosun's recent update is supported by this one statement:

"Kim promised Trump during their summit on Tuesday to dismantle this facility," a diplomatic source said. He said that Kim presented the offer as a kind of surprise card to Trump, who is known to like showy outcomes.

I expect the MSM hasn't been able to independently confirm which facility may be destroyed so has not made an update.

**38north is monitoring satellite images of the site and report no evidence anything has been done or started as of 7 hours.**

It's a show of good faith, but this isn't too significant of a concession.

North Korea's rocket engine test site is just a concrete structure that can mount a rocket engine.

> If I could make a personal speculation, I think this time it's for real. You have a president who does unconventional things and doesn't care for the status quo and add to that, he has pretty much consolidated power within the legal boundaries (reps are now afraid to anger Trump), so his word goes. And he appears determined to write his legacy on the Korean peninsula issue.

Well, NK destroyed [Yongbyon in 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongbyon_Nuclear_Scientific_Research_Center) and the agreement looks pretty similar to the 1993 [Joint statement](http://nautilus.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/CanKor_VTK_1993_06_11_joint_statement_dprk_usa.pdf) (pdf) so it is not exactly that we've seen a similar situation before.  However, Trump is a republican and so it is probable that at least a Republican congress will not sabotage a peace process. 

> On the other hand, Kim seems to be quite a departure from his dad and grand dad in terms of how he conducts diplomacy as well. 

Interestingly, on German TV [(Video, German)](https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/video/video-413337.html) a IR professor mentioned that Kim changed the NK propaganda from "military" to "military and economic" development. (And claims that they even dropped "military" this year.) So it may be, that he indeed tries to follow sort of a Chinese path.

TITLE: Russia secretly offered North Korea a nuclear power plant, officials say

COMMENTS:
SS: Similar to the failed agreement between the US and DPRK in the 90s, last year the Russians offered DPRK to build a nuclear power plant in exchange for nuclear disarmament. This is in line with Russia's attempts at building economic ties via energy with the Korean Peninsula.
---
Which actually, is not bad for South Korea either. South Korea needs energy at the cheapest price if possible. If Russia can provide energy for South Korea via a trans-peninsular pipeline, then that would be a huge gain for South Korean industry. South Korea is the second largest importer of natural gas, and Russia may want to have a good customer who does not give a damn about Ukraine. Moreover, a SK-Russian agreement may have a restraining effect on NK. Mr. Putin won't forgive NK if they suddenly cut off one of his major sources of revenue.

TITLE: North Korea Threatens to Resume Nuclear Program, Slams Sanctions

COMMENTS:
I guess I'll step in with an SS:

The question of sanctions relief is going to be a huge issue between the US and ROK in the coming weeks/months because many proposed inter-Korean projects like reconnecting rail lines and follow-on initiatives like reopening Kaesong industrial plant or resuming tourism at Mt. Kumgang would be in violation of UN sanctions. It's not clear exactly how South Korea plans to move forward with these projects, whether it will unilaterally lift sanctions, or seek sanctions exemptions from the UN.

Also, there's little indication that North Korea has actually paused its nuclear/missile program. They stopped tests but haven't dismantled anything significant, and activity has been observed at weapons facilities.
---
US has midterm congressional election in a week. This play is probably aimed towards that as well?

On an unrelated note, I hate it when Anglophone journalists use the word "slam" in headlines. The word is so overused and a trick to getting an emotional response out of you. This isn't wrestling.
---
You're the real MVP. Just popped in to see if there was an SS.

Well, Trump isn't really a reliable source for information. If Trump says there is good progress, then it foremost means that he has to tell his base something that makes him look good, especially regarding the upcoming midterm elections.

TITLE: North Korea has increased nuclear production at secret sites, say U.S. officials

COMMENTS:
Not surprising. Giving up nuclear would be the dumbest thing North Korea can do considering how the US dealt with Iraq and Libya.
---
Now they're dealing with Trump, who is willing to throw allies under the bus to look good. I don't think an ally under threat is as strong a deterrent anymore.
---
SS:  U.S. intelligence agencies believe that North Korea has increased its production of fuel for nuclear weapons at multiple secret sites in recent months — and that Kim Jong Un may try to hide those facilities as he seeks more concessions in nuclear talks with the Trump administration, U.S. officials told NBC News.

While the North Koreans have stopped missile and nuclear tests, "there's no evidence that they are decreasing stockpiles, or that they have stopped their production," said one U.S. official briefed on the latest intelligence. "There is absolutely unequivocal evidence that they are trying to deceive the U.S."
---
Better put a hold on the engraving for the peace prize there Bob.... shits lookin sketchy

> Uh the US already tried invading it before, would have succeeded too if it wasn't for China.

You seem to have a shaky grasp of the history of the conflict. Were you unaware that North Korea started the war by invading the south, or do you think following an enemy in an active engagement past an original border counts as an invasion?  
  
>You think so? I think it's weak to not see the connection.

Honestly, not trying to be rude, but does this actually pass for an argument where you come from? Bald contradiction?  
  
You're wrong because the US chose *not* to invade because of the conventional ordinance already aimed at Seoul, in the mid-nineties. This is on record and an established fact. Are you honestly having problems recognizing the difference?  
  
People in this sub tend to support their opinions with facts. You don't seem to belong here, to be honest.

TITLE: North Korea making 'rapid' upgrades to nuclear reactor despite summit pledges

COMMENTS:
Just looked at the original analysis at [38north](https://www.38north.org/2018/06/yongbyon062618/), and the key sentence is:

> Continued work at the Yongbyon facility should not be seen as having any relationship to North Korea’s pledge to denuclearize. The North’s nuclear cadre can be expected to proceed with business as usual until specific orders are issued from Pyongyang.

So, NK never said that they would immediately halt work in Yongbyon and they did not halt work there. 

And a general reminder, "denuclearize" is a word that was specifically chosen to avoid any meaning.
---
> There was no guarantee that North Korea would uphold their end of the bargain, and here's the evidence that they are doing just that - ignoring any "obligations" they might have had under the vague and useless agreement signed at Singapore

The problem is that there was no bargain, and North Korea never said it was going  to stop work on the reactor, so this is really a non issue. You seem to be trying to impute bad faith to North Korea for failing to honour commitments it never in fact made. You seem to indirectly acknowledge this yourself by putting g "obligations" in scare quotes, refering to said "obligations" in the conditional sense (as in "may have undertaken"), and characterising the agreement as "vague and useless".

> The United States can show a commitment to such a deal by lifting sanctions on a particular commodity that North Korea needs (e.g. coal). Soon after, North Korea needs to show evidence of some kind of solid step toward denuclearization

That's not how these things work. If North Korea is actually going to give up its nuclear weapons - which I personally think is unlikely - it would only do so after a comprehensive agreement has been signed that spelled out the obligations each side was undertaking, not as the result of some piecemeal for for tat process in which the potential benefits are vague and potentially fleeting. We are a long way from any such agreement, and for one to even be possible you need to believe that the US has something to offer North Korea of commensurate value to it's nuclear weapons, and that North Korea believes it can trust any promises Trump might make.
---
>They do. There are no new NK missile and nuclear tests. 

Sure, but this article clearly says their nuclear activity has not ceased (in a combat sense). The strategic development of a nuclear weapons center is an offensive maneuver, plain and simple, in case that's not clear. I don't think anyone thinks that just having NK stop testing nukes was enough for the United States. If they do, it's news to me. Any kind of move to resolve the situation completely from the United States must include a deal where NK no longer has nukes. The US just wouldn't agree to anything else, and agreeing to anything else would be a poor strategic choice IMO. 

EDIT: [Here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/05/23/pompeo-north-korea-united-states-summit-kim-jong-un/636311002/) is Pompeo stating in clear terms that the US would make no deal in which NK did not unilaterally denuclearize.

>Do you expect SK to shut down their nuclear plants and Moon drop his plans for nuclear subs?

No one said this. You're strawmanning. Me personally, I am in favor of allowing any country that develops nuclear tech to pursue it for energy reasons. Also, I don't see why SK needs nuclear subs right now given the United States has plenty.
---
**Submission Statement:** The article talks about how North Korea, despite it's pledges at the June Singapore summit with Trump, is making continued and rapid infrastructural improvements at the Yongbyon nuclear plant, according to a satellite-image analysis by the monitoring group '38 North' (link to the indepth analysis in the article or [here](https://www.38north.org/2018/06/yongbyon062618) ).

The Yongbyon powerplant is North Koreas only known nuclear reactor used to produce the fuel for its weapons program. While other experts say it is expected that work on the reactor continues until Pyongyang orders to shut it down, the monitoring group 38 North says it “underscores reason why an actual deal is necessary, not just a statement of lofty goals.” in their [Twitter announcement](https://twitter.com/j3nnyt0wn/status/1011780442423545856).

Despite any clear commitment from North Koreas side, South Korea is pushing forward diplomatic efforts and plans a two-country railway line. Albeit "progress on the nuclear issue and the lifting of sanctions would have to come before any joint rail projects".

---
Calling N.Korea an “extraordinary threat” and extending sanctions a few days after the summit doesn’t feel like a sign of good will. 

Also I don’t think it’s the USA that brought N & S Korea this far. I wonder who else Kim has been visiting for briefings all this time before and after the summit.

Do you seriously think pausing military exercises is enough good will for the American side? And I wonder who’s [idea this deescalation is](http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1458508.shtml). 

If you seriously think the US “fire and fury” of A brought Kim to the table you’re greatly mistaken.

SS; satellite images show 'rapid' construction at the Yongbyon facility. Upgrades have been completed to the secondary cooling loop, new buildings have been erected next to the cooling tower and upgrades to the Engineering room for the experimental light water reactor (ELWR) seem complete. It is unclear whether the reactor is operational and the group caution:

>Continued work at the Yongbyon facility should not be seen as having any relationship to North Korea’s pledge to denuclearize. The North’s nuclear cadre can be expected to proceed with business as usual until specific orders are issued from Pyongyang

The managing director of 38 North said on Twitter

TITLE: Seoul wants US, China to declare end to Korean War

COMMENTS:
SS: South Korea has allegedly asked the US to make key concessions to overcome the current standoff in US – North Korea negotiations. Seoul has allegedly told Washington it wants:

* a formal and official end to the 1950-53 Korean War (to be announced at the upcoming UN General Assembly); and
* a partial lifting of sanctions on North Korea.

These are both concessions which Pyongyang wants, but Washington has so far been reluctant to deliver, without seeing material progress towards denuclearization first.
---
An end to the Korean War improves SK's security position while weakening that of Japan, the US, Russia, and (arguably) China.  What is SK willing to offer?

To be fair, though, Moon has a great sense of timing.  Given that China, SK, and Japan are on the same side of this trade war, Russia was never a formal diplomatic participant in the Korean conflict, and Trump has staked a fair bit of political capital on Korean peace, now is the best time Moon could ask for such a thing.
---
Could you please elaborate on how an end to the Korean War (i.e. not actual reunification) would erode China's security position?  I'm only seeing the Chinese position strengthen from less US military involvement on the peninsula.
---
I mean who except Trump & co. didn’t see this coming?
---
I'm gonna say maybe the South Korean democratically elected government with popular support should have more say over ending their war than some guy from New Zealand obsessed with Kim Jong Un. Korean political decisions should not be up to the "US getting what it wants"...

Well yes naturally, Wikipedia would be the place to go for amalgamated information on the topic as a whole, but I just wrote a quick article explaining the basics of the program as a whole and then a brief run down of the missiles. Had I included every single missile including things like the 화성-1 and other artillery rockets, then yeah it would have been more detailed but then you might as well have just gone to read the Wikipedia page, which, fair enough, but you can’t criticise an article for not being as detailed as Wikipedia unless the article stipulates specifically that it aims to be just as detailed as Wikipedia - people rarely go to read full wiki articles for that very reason, too much information and technical jargon, so I wrote an introductory piece to explain the basics and anyone who is interested in the topic is one more person who can feel more prepared to read more in depth.

Well naturally I appreciate the constructive criticism, however there is a difference between just ‘cutting the fat’ of a factual wiki page and writing a factual article. However I will, of course, take your criticism into account whilst writing future articles. I would recommend there are better ways to provide such criticism than commenting a single sentence calling an article ‘underwhelming’ - so of course I am sorry you were not significantly ‘whelmed’ 😂 Anyway cheers for the advice

Without nukes the U.S will surely invade north Korea. If Kim knows his history he should be aware that the U.S promise of "we won't invade you" is hardly reliable.

I must ask why NK should continue to denuclearise when the US has continued to encourage sanctions? It should be an equal effort by both parties.

COMMENTS:
WOWEE! What an amazing scoop, to report that unnamed officials told the Washington post that north korea is Definitely building new missiles. just amazing that US officials KNOW this.

Pompeo himself said in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he knows that NK is still producing fissile material.  If I were NK I would be producing missiles right up to the point that I had to sign a denuclearization agreement.  Keeping the pressure on the international community with the only bargaining chip they have is the most logical thing to do.

TITLE: Opinion: What I Learned Leading America's 1st Nuclear Inspection In North Korea . News

COMMENTS:
Interesting, especially: 

"After our team returned to Washington, the Clinton administration issued a public statement that there was no hidden facility, nor were the tunnels suitable for one without significant modifications that would take years to complete.

But there remained concerns about other suspicious sites in North Korea. While the Clinton administration also planned to inspect them, those visits never happened with the election of President George Bush and advisers, such as John Bolton, who chose to confront the North Koreans about suspected cheating. As a result, the 1994 agreement collapsed and North Korea continued its slow march to becoming a nuclear power. Indeed, North Korean negotiators later joked that Bolton was the father of their nuclear weapons program.

In short, the trick for any American president will be to judge whether that uncertainty warrants breaking the deal or whether U.S. security is better served by keeping it."

But there are no nukes in SK or Japan. If this writer did any damn research, he would have known that. There haven't been nukes there in years. We got rid of the SK nukes during the first Bush administration and the last of the Japanese nukes back in the 70s. They're asking for the total removal of American military presence in SK and are intimidated by a missile defense system, and that's a non-starter.

“Interesting,” if you can overlook the whole mutually assured destruction thing.

This is true. China hates NK but needs them as a buffer state between US-allied SK. But they also don’t want NK starting shit because that would suck for them.

TITLE: North Korea has increased nuclear production at secret sites, say U.S. officials

COMMENTS:
This is standard operating procedure for NK at this point. 

When sanctions on NK become too debilitating they make a show of their military/nuclear prowess. The world gets worried and they beg NK to bargain with them. NK demands less sanctions in exchange for ramping down their military. While NK reaps the benefits of looser sanctions they continue their military expansion and research underground until they are caught then they repeat the cycle - sanctions, bargain, underground.

If you are Kim, how do you convince the US that you are going to denuke?  Insist on 3rd party observers (IAEA).  If you are the US, how do you ensure the NK is serious and is following through?  You insist on 3rd party observers.  If you just want to con the people, you don't do that and you call any evidence of continuing activity fake news.  You want to know what a real sign of denuclearization is?  IAEA officials on the ground with full cooperation from NK.

it could easily be more "fed his uncle to dogs" imperialist propaganda.  military stock plummeted after peace began looking like an option.  I've heard they are just doing maintenance.

also, it doesn't mean North Korea is really planning a sneak attack.  it could be that they still don't trust the U.S. given how Trump has flip-flopped multiple times.  after the summit he called North Korea a great threat again, with no provocation.  I haven't trusted the U.S. with this this whole time and I'm a U.S. citizen.  I wouldn't expect North Korea to either

From the prospective or the rest of the world:

Kim starved millions of his citizens while accepting billions in aid from the West, including the UNITED STATES! Punishes dissent with hard labor and/or death. Has forced abortions, low literacy rate. INVADED its neighbor to the south. Threatens Australia with nuclear strike. Kim Jong un kills his relatives and their families. Has attempted multiple times to invade South Korea. Also has military drills to mock invade other countries. Has not been attacked by any country since the armistice yet still attacks other countries. Has artillery aimed at the South ALWAYS. ABDUCTS international citizens from sovereign nations. Has no civil rights. Public EXECUTIONS! Death penalty for political reasons. All-pervasive and severe restrictions on the freedoms of thought, conscience, religion, opinion and expression, peaceful assembly. No freedom of movement. The list is almost endless.

TITLE: Trump Says North Korea Is No Longer a Nuclear Threat

COMMENTS:
Exactly no one believes this

Funny it has come to the point that the best case scenario is the President of the United States is lying to the entire world. Because the worse case scenario in this specific instance is he actually believes what he just wrote. 

It would be intersting to find out that some of the things everyone laughs off and takes for granted he's lying about, he actually believes is true. 

After listening closely to the entire post-summit press conference, I honestly think he's actually sincere about some of the fantastical things he keeps saying over and over again to us. 

This guy is a 72 year old essentric billionaire with some mental and personality disorders who's never been  confronted with them, let alone treated. He's lived his entire adult life in a fantasy world where no one says no to him (or at least gets away with it). 

I have a feeling in his own mind he's convinced himself he made world history by "saving the lives of 30 million people".

They weren't a nuclear threat to begin with, and they aren't now. They are never going to use their nuclear weapons for anything but a deterrent, because they know that using them otherwise is a guarantor of retaliation.

TITLE: The case for Russian engagement in the Korean peninsula

POST: The case for Russian engagement in the Korean peninsula

Submission Statement:

Russia is today a "former" great power trying to restore its past glory. Yet, they are hindered by demographic, economic and political difficulties which are hard to overcome. They are aging fast, they are dying fast and they have enemies everywhere. Some western analysts are saying that China and Russia are getting closer than ever, and that it is a big threat which needs to be addressed. They are correct to a certain degree. But they need to realize that Russia is actually more afraid of China than Europe or the USA. They share a massive land-border and if Russia fails to modernize its economy, they will become essentially a vassal state to China. The recent Sino-Russian alignment is nothing but the result of immediate concerns and has no solid foundation. The real big player and threat is China. Therefore, I would like to argue that Russia must be lured to our side by providing her with tangible benefits, and Korea could play a key role in making that happen.

First, it is necessary to note that the "Korean Question" is one of the most crucial flashpoints in East Asia. North Korea must be restrained but they won't unless they get something in return. However, last year has been a phase of great pacification by giving momentum to diplomacy and negotiations. Now, the US and North Korea are vying for some kind of compromise. In the process, South Korea has repeatedly advocated for a Russian engagement. We have made explicit our plans for railroads and pipelines. So, what does this mean?

South Korea is the second largest importer of natural gas in the world. Russia needs to diversify its customer base. They are almost entirely relying on Western Europe and their relations are sour at best. South Korea can provide cash for oil/gas and we can invest in Russia to build factories and create jobs. On the other hand, Korea can make its industry more competitive by lowering energy costs and therefore generating more wealth for the country. Should South Korea become richer and stronger, we could afford to pay more for US forces and we could buy more US weapons.

South Korea can serve as a gateway for Russia for foreign markets too. Russia's Far East will have more jobs and more factories, more goods. We will bring them via railway to our markets and we can re-export them to the outer world.

If Russia gets a regular continous and reliable source of income by establishing closer connection with South Korea, by having North Korea as a road, then Russia will have more than enough incentives to restrain North Korea's behavior. Russia has a land-border with North Korea, and Russia has the willpower to engage militarily if a third-rate power crosses in their path.

A Russo-Korean (South) cooperation with the benediction of the US will serve as a good encircling web against China. It will enrich South Korea, it will enrich (to a certain degree) Russia and reduce their dependency of China, it will restrain North Korea by making them content to have a rent revenue. All the parties involved would be satisfied and reduce the risks of armed conflict. Therefore, I'd argue that South Korea needs a new Nordpolitik focusing on Russia, and that the US/EU should seek a rapprochement with Russia to counterbalance the immense threat that China poses to the whole world.

COMMENTS:
Fuck Russia and China lol. Both are anti democratic cuntholes
---
Interesting post! However Russia almost give the impression that it is not interested in building real close relationship with any country other than some former USSR member states. As you said, their current friendship with China is shallow and they know they need to hedge against China at some point, but they completely ignore the possibility to develop tied with Japan by signing the peace treaty.

TITLE: China deliberately building 113 coal power plants near the Korean Peninsula

COMMENTS:
This thing is going to get a lot worse. I mean a lot worse. They're building all these cheapest coal plants with no pollution controls whatsoever right on the Chinese eastern coast line which is off the western coast of Korea. And China just fairly recently completed their planned move of hundreds of pollution creating coal plants and factories away from Beijing and Shanghai, and into the same area where they're now building even more new power plants in the 100's. Their logic is that the seasonal easterly wind will blow across to Korea, away from China. So it's like Korea is turning into China's huge trash dump.

And you won't find any sympathy or guilt from the Chinese. My hate and my contempt for China grows every day. I hope they rot in hell.

These are two VERY different situations. EU member countries are still sovereign states that have agreed to a certain set of common regulations and goals (of which they routinely break anyway). Hong Kong is completely under China's thumb and China only allows them a facade of political independence because they don't want to tip the boat and cause an economic crash.

TITLE: Were the Four Commanderies of the Chinese Han dynasty actually on the Korean peninsula?

POST: Is there any convincing evidence that the Chinese Four Commanderies ever existed in Korea, which means ethnic Chinese ever colonized and settled in Korea?

Supposedly there would be very little genetic imprint from these colonies as Sima Yi ordered the evacuation of most Chinese settlers living in these areas as well as the Liaodong peninsula just north of Korea

COMMENTS:
Both Bakje and Koguryo held territory in mainland China for well over a hundred years according to Chinese records. You can read the bottom passage here which [quotes the relevant texts](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Baekje).

Linguists like Vovin, Robbetts, Unger, and Janhunen all basically agree that both Bakje and Koguryo spoke Koreanic languages. If those nation states aren't "korean" then what are they? Manchurian? Chinese? Korean language is about as related to Chinese or Manchurian as Spanish is to Swahili or Hebrew.
---
sigh...

It makes no sense that you said you are a US citizen.
---
Its a topic of controversy in Korea, with the Nay crowd pointed to written records that point to a distinction between a separate Nakrang state in western NK and Nakrang the Han commandary northwest of the Yalu River.

But mainstream conservative position is that the han commandary was in North Korea, then it became an semi independent state (note that the Han dynasty broke apart and its hold on provinces faltered), which then got reconquered by Goguryeo.

But I dont think this reay matters in the grand scope of things despite the nationalism from both sides. Korean kingdoms controlled large swathes of land in China too, and we dont lay claim to chinese land we had 1500 years ago.
---
Overall analysis of martial history between Korea and China lends to evidence that Chinese campaigns in Korea ended up in not much ground gained and rather massive casualty numbers for China.

In the Battle of Salsu in particular it only took a few cavalry units numbering in the thousands to butcher nearly half a million chinese. I think it might be one of the most embarrassing engagements in all of military history. (btw the wiki page that says they were drowned by a river has been debunked by historians, and if you know the geography it's pretty clear drowning there would have been impossible.)
---
Yes, basically [most of what is North Korea today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Commanderies_of_Han), though half of them (the 2 southern ones closest to South Korea) were conquered by Koreans within 25 years and the northernmost one was pushed back to current-day China within 100 years or so. It's interesting to see parallels with the [Roman presence in Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Britain): virtually the same time period and duration (both around 400 years from around the beginning of the first millennium) and similar territorial pattern (half the peninsula, half the island). Speaking of parallels with Britain, you might be interested in my comment about [parallels between the English-Greek/Latin relationship and Korean-Hanja relationship](https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/8iv9t6/do_educated_koreans_still_learn_chinese/dyuxe5n/).

As for genetics, a study found that Koreans have 20% Chinese DNA and Chinese have 10% Korean DNA (https://heritageofjapan.wordpress.com/yayoi-era-yields-up-rice/who-were-the-yayoi-people/making-sense-of-dna-data-and-origins-of-the-japanese/).

Unimportant. Trump is unlikely to get his way from the nationalistic members of his own party. Trump is also more concerned about seeing whether he can milk a trade concession or a photo-op from South Korea's rapproachment with North Korea.

All of that statistics apply to South Korea also. If US wants to reduce their forces by half and only have troops in Japan thats diminishing their influence. If they want to put all those troops into Japan for one thing Japan wouldn't accept it and secondly no skin off of South Korea's back if US wants to shift all the cost to Japan right next door.

The average american overestimate their leverage value. Good thing military leaders are smarter.

As I've been saying for a while Trump is going to be so busy with investigation in the next few years that all SK-NK has to do is make minimal effort to please Trump and have him sign the treaty which Trump will do in order to make himself look good in the shit storm that's about to fall on him this year.

That's what the reserve is for, that's what you are activatable for after your base service. There is no point in maintaining a big active force without being involved in actual conflicts. The US has a big active paid military force because they are active all over the world in conflict zones. The US has no forced military service tho, they pay their recruits, they work on incentives to make it attractive to be in the military.

There is no "deterrent" value anymore these times - we don't live in 1940. If NK tries anything excessive towards SK the whole world goes down on them because of the global economical value of SK. It's done...
---
See people like you don't seem to know the price of freedom. Never experienced a big war or conflict, and just assume that things will always be peaceful like this. China is literally putting Muslims in camps. Other countries do much worse. Having this sort of stability in the Western world and in much of the other parts of the world doesn't just exist or happen. Do you really think because we live in modern times, that a country doesn't need some sort of military to protect itself? Naive at best.

Your whole "if the South gets attacked, the world will rescue it" is how Korea got screwed so many times in the past (never being able to defend itself.

COMMENTS:
Interesting this:

> A 2018 Ipsos national inclusiveness survey asked respondents in 27 countries what they think makes someone a “real” national. One question asked respondents whether immigrants who obtain citizenship and can speak the native language fluently are “real” nationals. In South Korea, 64 percent said yes. Another question asked whether an immigrant who married a native of the host country is a “real” national: 40 percent of South Koreans said yes.
>
>These numbers are comparatively high. For example, in Canada, a country with a strong multicultural identity, 71 percent said obtaining citizenship and speaking a native language are sufficient for national inclusion, and 43 percent said marrying a native is enough. By contrast, in Japan, a country whose policies on immigration and nationality run closer to the South Korean past, these numbers are considerably lower at 25 percent and 15 percent.

No, I've never even been to Korea. I was browsing ebay one day, and happened to notice a set of slides taken in 1952 Korea.

US soldiers were the only ones with access to Kodachrome slide film back then, as it had to be sent back to the US for   developing by Kodak, so they are the ones who took these color photos. My page has also branched out into albums of Japan and Hong Kong, as I did happen to visit them in '72. I have hundreds of followers of this page in Asia-many of these photos have been seen in TV news segments, books, and museum exhibits. It's an expensive hobby-I get outbidded frequently on ebay-a single slide of a '50s street scene in Korea or HK can sometimes go for several hundred dollars-I'm having to slow down lately.

welcome to /r/Korea: you don't agree with my worldview? fuck you, Reddit is what *I* want it to be

It's about time a foreign press looked at this issue honestly, instead of transferring word for word, South Korea's official English translated speeches and interviews which are designed to mislead the world. This government says one thing to the world, then says completely different in Korean. The result is that you get completely wrong impressions which South Korean government wants you to have.

Main Article:
-----------
>How Seoul Tacitly Endorses Pyongyang’s Brutality
>Moon Jae-in’s English statements sound nice, but his Korean speeches are akin to surrender.

>Since President Trump and Kim Jong Un’s summit in June, the two leaders have issued a series of statements in English. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has weighed in too, with vague words promoting hope for denuclearization and a better life for the North Korean people. Yet Mr. Moon tells a different story in Korean.

>Consider the speeches the South Korean president delivered in North Korea last month. At a dinner on Sept. 18, he declared he was “truly astonished by Pyongyang’s development.” He didn’t say how this “development” has had any positive effect on the North Korean people. Outside Pyongyang, North Koreans suffer. One third of North Korea’s children are malnourished while the regime focuses resources on nuclear warheads, missiles and luxuries to keep the elites content.

>In his speech, Mr. Moon expressed hope that inter-Korean collaboration could “span across the continent to reach Russia and Europe, and across the sea to reach Asean and India.” He made no mention of the U.S. He also told Mr. Kim that if they “put their heads and hearts together,” they will find ways to develop the “military, economy, society and culture of South and North Korea.” Yet some 80% of North Korea’s military, 1.2 million strong, remains forward-deployed, poised to attack. North Korea’s long-range artillery stands ready to strike from the Kaesong Heights.

>Mr. Moon also recalled that during his first in-person meeting with Mr. Kim, the two crossed the military demarcation line “hand in hand, like two affectionate lovers.” That’s nice, but since then Mr. Kim has done nothing to reduce the threat his country poses to its neighbor. And he continues to abuse more than 100,000 men, women and children in his notorious political prison camps.

>The day after the dinner, Mr. Moon spoke before thousands of North Korea’s “core class,” gathered for a gymnastic and artistic festival. He used Mr. Kim’s exact locution in averring a joint commitment to a Korean Peninsula “without nuclear weapons and nuclear threats.” The truth is that the South has been nuclear-free since 1991. It’s the North that needs to give up its weapons. To Mr. Kim, denuclearization of the “entire Korean Peninsula” means removing South Korea from the safety of the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Mr. Moon effectively announced support for Mr. Kim’s goal of ending the U.S.-South Korea alliance.

>Mr. Moon also said his heart was “warmed and throbbing” at the sight of the country his North Korean brethren were building. He expressed admiration for North Koreans who maintained “the nation’s pride” even in tough times, possibly a reference to the famine of the 1990s. The truth is that when life-supporting aid to North Korea from allied communist countries stopped flowing in the ’90s, the regime failed to reform. Whatever precious resources it could obtain were given only to military and political elites. Those ranking lower in North Korea’s songbun system of social classification were condemned to starvation, their access to food, medicine and other aid severed. The regime blamed the U.S. and told its subjects that, despite the suffering, they maintained the nation’s pride throughout that “arduous march.” Mr. Moon’s words lent support to this fallacious tale.

>The South Korean president stated that the two leaders had agreed to the principle of jaju-wonchik, or unification through self-determination. This principle is derived from North Korea’s juche ideology of self-reliance. A quick Korean-language internet search of the term will bring up North Korean propaganda websites such as Uriminzokkiri and the Korean Central News Agency. “Unification through self-determination” also excludes outsiders, especially the U.S.

>Mr. Moon’s speeches may read like peace-building. But to those familiar with North Korean ideology, a speech tacitly endorsing juche only validates Mr. Kim’s brand of totalitarianism. It’s a statement of support for North Korean ideology and all that goes along with it, including nuclear weapons. Mr. Moon’s speech gave legitimacy to Mr. Kim’s corrupt and horrific rule.

>Opposing the Pyongyang regime’s repression of the North Korean people and its threats to the South has become increasingly difficult with Mr. Moon in office. His government has reduced funding for organizations that promote human rights in the North by more than 90%, stopped balloon launches and loudspeaker broadcasting across the Demilitarized Zone and has been censoring the content of USB thumb drives smuggled by activists into North Korea. It is hard to imagine how Mr. Moon will ever move from warm praise of Mr. Kim to addressing the dire human-rights situation of North Koreans.

>Mr. Scarlatoiu is executive director of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea.

TITLE: September Pyongyang Joint Declaration is Munich Conference of 21st century

POST: Their basic strategy is Stick-and-carrot strategy. And President Moon Jaeang(Disaster) agreed on open Han river. That means South Korea allows to open direct path to Seoul. I predict that they will soon invade South.

COMMENTS:
Actually no, it is much worse than Munich. Chamberlain threw another country under the bus. Moonie threw his own (at least nominally) country under the bus.

I would compare it to Treaty of Versailles, with South Korea as Germany.

South Korea is disarming. Land fortifications are being dismantled. Note that Korea is no longer able to conduct military exercises near the border. Remember how Germany was forced to demilitarize Rhineland after Versailles? 

To imagine that this country is doing all this without actually losing the war... Sheer disgrace.

TITLE: Results of the 5th Inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang | Mansudae-Korea

COMMENTS:
>With what we know at this point, it does not seem like any significant concession has been made on either side which moves us closer to denuclearisation.

I don't understand why should South Korea make any concession. The development of nuclear weapons by North Korea itself destroyed a relation between South Korea and North Korea and any faith that South Korea had in North Korea. It was a breach of spirits of previous summits including the 'historic' summit of 2000. President Kim said North Korea wouldn't develop nuclear weapons, yet they did anyway. South Korea already made a big concession by ceasing the military exercise with the US and should not reward a bad behavior of North Korea with more concessions. 

Denuclearisation is the first step that North Korea needs to take, so they could re-gain a trust from South Korea. It should not be done in exchange of a reward or a concession.
---
I understand that KJU wants the US, South Korea and other nations to guarantee his regime and he is using the 'denuclearization' as his bargaining chip. However, South Korea which desires the re-unification cannot allow that happening. If you were in the shoes of South Korea, you would understand that KJU and his monarch are ultimately obstacles to the road of the re-unification. It is a folly to permit the existence of the hereditary dictatorship of North Korea in exchange of denuclearisation when the nuclearisation should have not happened according to the previous agreements.
---
The goal of this whole new detente policy from MJI and his administration is not reunification. In fact, it is the normalisation of diplomatic relations. Increasingly, reunification is polling badly within SK because of the immense economic burden it would become
---
Weston, I agree that the end game of Moon administration here is recognizing North Korea as an independent nation and establishing a normal diplomatic tie with North Korea. 

The problem is that the Moon administration is selling this whole negotiation as a step towards the re-unification and they justify all the talks of financial aids and investments in North Korean infrastructure that Moon promised in the name of the re-unification. Although, it is true that re-unification has became more and more unpopular, there is a good number of people who support the idea.
---
The issue is, that in this current climate, the DPRK is by all accounts, a nuclear state. Their argument is that their nuclear program is required as a defence against the US. If you were in their shoes, dismantling your nuclear force before the United States agrees to a peace deal would be idiotic, because you're removing your defence. So there is no way any concessions will be made on denuclearisation by Pyongyang because a significant reciprocal action is made by Washington

You're pretty much 'homeless' in North Korea whether or not you are allotted the housing by the socialist system. Materialistically you are 'homeless', and even in a legal sense you are 'homeless' because you don't own your house, the government does.

None of it was propaganda or "staged" purely for tourists, it shows the ordinary and unordinary sides of life; people going about their lives, whilst being mobilized for given state duties. Still, it challenges "conventional" depictions of the country and allows us to remember that North Korea is not just a regime, a bomb, a war or a man, but a people, whom despite unfavourable circumstances endeavor to get on with their lives.

For those who say it is not a "true" impression of North Korean life, I will be posting another gallery of rural photos in poorer areas tomorrow. Enjoy.

The way they are treated in South Korea is similar to how rural/provincial South Koreans were treated by Seoulites just a few decades ago. It will take time (decades) but if North Korea's economy improves and there is more cultural and economic flow/integration then reunification in the future will be easier. Definitely not something that's going to happen overnight.

I honestly don't really see the difficulty in reunifying socially and culturally.

North Korea seems well organized that social and cultural unification will be a quick and efficient process.  But, SK will have to sacrifice some for the process.  People should really accept that North Korea is socially and culturally behind 30 years for the time being and avoid antagonizing the "backwards" North Koreans who really couldn't help it

You’re comparing limited war to total war. While yes, there were actions along the border by South Korea in the early parts of the war, the North did this as well. The fact remains that the transition to total war was led by the north not the south. 

The last portion of that chapter was taken from primary Soviet sources without presenting the appropriate American and South Korean primary sources. I am not discounting it’s accuracy but it would be a relevant inclusion if he was going to argue that the South started it all; which he isn’t arguing because it’s not accurate to say that the South started the conflict. From a post-modernist standpoint, trying to pin conflict creation on one side or another isn’t a sound argument and oversimplifies the dynamics occurring in both regions at the time, which the author discusses in his previous chapter. 

Similar to Sino-Soviet warfare in the last part of the 20th century, neither side crossed the threshold into total war but they did occasionally dally in limited war (mostly in 1969). Whereas the north crossed that threshold and began a major offensive that triggered the beginning of the war.

TITLE: All Hype and No Substance - the recent report from CSIS about "discovering" North Korea's missile bases

POST: As much as I personally dislike Trump and that I myself don't believe North Korea will fully denuclearize anytime soon (it is currently doubtful, if ever)**, this recent article from the New York Time about the recent CSIS report is ALL HYPE AND NO REAL SUBSTANCE.**

&#x200B;

First, the obvious thing - **the photos from the CSIS report dates back to March 2018 (they literally say so on the images), before the first inter-Korean summit in 2018 even occurred.**  Most if not all of North Korea's token overtures about de-nuclearization occurred AFTER the Panmunjom Declaration (April 27 2018). **For that matter, it was not until the SEPTEMBER 2018 Pyeongyang Joint Statement that Kim Jong Un even gave an official promise to explicitly not conduct nuclear or missile tests - Kim has kept his promise to Trump so far (surprisingly)**.

&#x200B;

Missile Base Photos from CSIS - **March 29, 2018**

1st summit between North & South Korea in over a decade - **April 27, 2018**.

Trump - Kim Summit - **June 12, 2018**.

&#x200B;

Trump and Kim didn't even meet at the time that the photos for the missile bases were taken. In fact, North Korea and South Korea didn't even have their first summit for the Panmunjom Statement back then.

&#x200B;

More importantly however, **in both of the November 2018 CSIS reports that the New York Times refers to, the main specifics in the reports are almost completely based on supposition and lacks any recent data or sources - most of their source references date back to the 1990s, for god's sake. So why is a report largely based on references from 20 years ago being used to tie in with Trump's foreign policy, who's only been president since 2017?** There was only 1 article from 2018, and that was the article " North Korean Missile Base Shows Operational Focus,” from Jane's. Except this is stating the obvious - of course North Korea would maintain operational missile capability; missiles are North Korea's only viable deterrence against the USA given America's past history of regime changes (cough Gaddafi cough), and North Korea hasn't even promised to dismantle its ballistic missile program in any of the 2018 Joint Statements.

Here are the links to the CSIS reports below - please, go take a look at their source reference footnotes and their dates:

[https://beyondparallel.csis.org/north-koreas-undeclared-missile-operating-bases/](https://beyondparallel.csis.org/north-koreas-undeclared-missile-operating-bases/)

[https://beyondparallel.csis.org/undeclared-north-korea-sakkanmol-missile-operating-base/](https://beyondparallel.csis.org/undeclared-north-korea-sakkanmol-missile-operating-base/)

&#x200B;

**And finally, perhaps the most laughable thing about this is the fact that THE REGION OF SAKKANMOL WAS A KNOWN MISSILE SITE YEARS BEFORE THE CSIS REPORT.**

&#x200B;

**In the past couple of decades, there have been multiple instances where missiles were fired from the region around Sakkanmol, enough so that back in no later than 2016 - over 2 years ago - there were NEWS ARTICLES pointing out Sakkanmol as a site for missile bases.** The link for proof is below - it's in Korean though, so I'll translate the relevant paragraph.

[https://news.joins.com/article/20329452](https://news.joins.com/article/20329452)

>이에 앞서 북한은 지난 3월10일에도 황해북도 황주군 삭간몰 일대에서 원산 동북방 방향 동해상으로 스커드 계열로 추정되는 단거리 탄도미사일 2발을 발사했으며, 당시에도 비행거리는 500㎞로 전해진 바 있다  
>  
>**Translation:** Prior to this, North Korea previously fired 2 short range ballistic missiles presumed to be Scud variants from the North Hwanghae Province, Hwangju County, **Sakkanmol region** to the East Sea in a northeast direction on March 10, and the flight distance is reported to be 500km then as well.

And the date of this news article? ***July 19, 2016***.

&#x200B;

But wait, there's more -  here's a couple of photos from Google Earth on ***April 23, 2017:***

[http://archivenew.vop.co.kr/images/3b94b39e8b1afee49a1b8c67ce774e0d/2018-11/marked/13024711\_change\_sakganmolgoogle.jpg](http://archivenew.vop.co.kr/images/3b94b39e8b1afee49a1b8c67ce774e0d/2018-11/marked/13024711_change_sakganmolgoogle.jpg)

Does this look familiar? They were taken at the area presumed to be a missile base in Sakkanmol. You know, the one that CSIS discovered from March 29 2018 photos - except **even Google beat them by a year**.

&#x200B;

**The fact that one of the authors of the reports is Victor Cha should tell you something -  Victor was the man behind G.W. Bush's foreign policy towards North Korea, i.e. he was the jackass who couldn't predict shit and basically twiddled his thumbs while allowing North Korea to go fully nuclear**. Victor Cha is to North Korea what Donald Rumsfeld is to the Iraq War - during his tenure under the Bush administration, Victor had made no serious attempt to really militarily pressure North Korea (having bombers fly over doesn't count since everyone before him did too), no real attempt to address North Korea's nuclear progress in spite of sanctions, etc.

&#x200B;

There's a more detailed criticism about the recent hype about the report from CSIS, except it's a Korean article. If you have the time, I recommend reading the link below - I'd translate it, but this post itself is already getting too long. I personally think that this news media is at times bit more left wing that I like, but the arguments made are valid.

**All this recent report does is basically regurgitate something that's already been known. For that matter, of course North Korea isn't going to dismantle its missile sites right now - North Korea never promised to dismantle its ballistic missile program in the Joint Statements, and it's the only thing North Korea has that can hit the USA.** Personally, I'm more interested in South Korea's current attempts to lift US restrictions on solid liquid fuel for Korean rockets, which is extremely useful for ROK space programs....and possibly any potential ROK development of ICBMs.

Just curious ... how would you translate "독기어린 치맛바람?"

I'm not sure if you realize this, but the line about the "swishing skirt" isn't a western news media translation - that's straight from North Korea's English language news media.  I can't find the specific example you cited, but Park's "swishing skirt" routine is old hat in North Korean English news:

Well ... exactly.  The NYT put that expression in quotes to set it apart and highlight just how bizarre and over the top North Korea gets while spewing its rhetoric.  If you rephrase the way you suggested (female busybodiness), it normalizes it.  Which begs the question, why should western news outlets normalize North Korean rhetoric?  I say leave it as is and let the world know how far out in left field North Korea is.

Don't get ahead yourself there. Your post was about the 'hypocrisy' that US would intervene NK ICBM missile program but not South Korea's. The situation in Middle East has a lot more countries involved and I am not knowledgeable on that part of the world to form an opinion.

So back to the Korean peninsula my home. You simply lack facts. It wasn't until late 2017(notice the timeline?) South Korea reached an agreement with US to increase the missile range up to 800km from 550km, which was increased from 300km in 2012. South Korean government proposed 1000km but that would irritate Beijing which will unnecessarily heighten tension in the peninsula(even East Asia as a whole once China gets involved). You see these military agreements are there for a reason. If the US didn't give a shit, SK may have already developed nulcear weapons(why not they got the resources and technology) right after the northern neighbor's first nuclear test in 2006. But that would be incredibly irresponsible of US and the international community understands it.

On the other hand, we've got a nation with a leader literally worshiped as god. And this kingdom with nuclear weapons is testing ballistic missiles(ICBM:range >5500km)  to reach the American continent. And these guys don't give a shit about International agreement or sanctions up until now since the God himself wants his nation rich like the neighbor. It wasn't far long ago this peace loving Kim family conducted a lovely campaign with saying 'our missiles will be able to reach any part of the part' so let us be.

If you had any sense of the situation of the Korean peninsula, you would've already known that US only reacts when NK throws a tantrum. At the end of the day, they're the ones who started all this mess.

**U.S. spy agencies: North Korea is working on new missiles**

U.S. spy agencies are seeing signs that North Korea is constructing new missiles at a factory that produced the country’s first intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States, according to officials familiar with the intelligence.

Newly obtained evidence, including satellite photos taken in recent weeks, indicates that work is underway on at least one and possibly two liquid-fueled ICBMs at a large research facility in Sanumdong, on the outskirts of Pyongyang, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe classified intelligence.

The findings are the latest to show ongoing activity inside North Korea’s nuclear and missile facilities at a time when the country’s leaders are engaged in arms talks with the United States. The new intelligence does not suggest an expansion of North Korea’s capabilities but shows that work on advanced weapons is continuing weeks after President Trump declared in a Twitter posting that Pyongyang was “no longer a Nuclear Threat.”

The reports about new missile construction come after recent revelations about a suspected uranium enrichment facility, called Kangson, that North Korea is operating in secret. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged during Senate testimony last week that North Korean factories “continue to produce fissile material” used in making nuclear weapons. He declined to say whether Pyongyang is building new missiles.

During a summit with Trump in June, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to a vaguely worded pledge to “work toward” the “denuclearization” of the Korean Peninsula. But since then, North Korea has made few tangible moves signaling an intention to disarm.

Instead, senior North Korean officials have discussed their intention to deceive Washington about the number of nuclear warheads and missiles they have, as well as the types and numbers of facilities, and to rebuff international inspectors, according to intelligence gathered by U.S. agencies. Their strategy includes potentially asserting that they have fully denuclearized by declaring and disposing of 20 warheads while retaining dozens more.

The Sanumdong factory has produced two of North Korea’s ICBMs, including the powerful Hwasong-15, the first with a proven range that could allow it to strike the U.S. East Coast. The newly obtained evidence points to ongoing work on at least one Hwasong-15 at the Sanumdong plant, according to imagery collected by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in recent weeks.

“We see them going to work, just as before,” said one U.S. official, who, like the others, spoke on the condition of anonymity in discussing sensitive intelligence. The exception, the officials said, is the Sohae Satellite Launching Station on North Korea’s west coast, where workers can be observed dismantling an engine test stand, honoring a promise made to Trump at the summit.

Many analysts and independent experts, however, see that dismantling as largely symbolic, since North Korea has now successfully launched ICBMs that use the kind of liquid-fueled engines tested at Sohae. Moreover, the test stand could easily be rebuilt within months.

Buttressing the intelligence findings, independent missile experts this week also reported observing activity consistent with missile construction at the Sanumdong plant. The daily movement of supply trucks and other vehicles, as captured by commercial satellite photos, shows that the missile facility “is not dead, by any stretch of the imagination,” said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. The Monterey, Calif., nonprofit group analyzed commercial photos obtained from the satellite imagery firm Planet.

“It’s active. We see shipping containers and vehicles coming and going,” Lewis said of the Sanumdong plant. “This is a facility where they build ICBMs and space-launch vehicles.”

Intriguingly, one image, taken July 7, depicts a bright-red covered trailer in a loading area. The trailer appears identical to those used by North Korea in the past to transport ICBMs. How the trailer was being used at the time of the photograph is unclear.

Lewis’s group also published images of a large industrial facility that some U.S. intelligence analysts believe to be the Kangson uranium enrichment plant. The images, first reported by the online publication the Diplomat, depict a football-field-size building surrounded by a high wall, in North Korea’s Chollima-guyok district, southwest of the capital. The complex has a single, guarded entrance and features high-rise residential towers apparently used by workers.

Historical satellite photos show that the facility was externally complete by 2003. U.S. intelligence agencies believe that it has been operational for at least a decade. If so, North Korea’s stockpile of enriched uranium could be substantially higher than is commonly believed. U.S. intelligence agencies in recent months increased their estimates of the size of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, taking into account enriched uranium from at least one secret enrichment site.

The Kangson facility was first publicly identified in May in a Washington Post article that cited research by nuclear weapons expert David Albright. Some European intelligence officials are not convinced that the Kangson site is used for uranium enrichment. But there is a broad consensus among U.S. intelligence agencies that Kangson is one of at least two secret enrichment plants.

Several U.S. officials and private analysts said the continued activity inside North Korea’s weapons complex is not surprising, given that Kim made no public promise at the summit to halt work at the scores of nuclear and missiles facilities scattered around the country.

The North Koreans “never agreed to give up their nuclear program,” said Ken Gause, a North Korea expert at the Center for Naval Analysis. And it is foolish to expect that they would do so — at the outset of talks, he said.

“Regime survival and perpetuation of Kim family rule” are Kim’s guiding principles, he said. “The nuclear program provides them with a deterrent in their mind against regime change by the United States. Giving up the nuclear capability will violate the two fundamental centers of gravity in the North Korean regime.”

Pompeo, at the Senate hearing last week, sought to assure lawmakers that the disarmament talks with North Korea remained on track and that the effort to dismantle the country’s nuclear arsenal was just getting underway. He brushed aside suggestions that the administration had been deceived by Kim. “We have not been taken for a ride,” he said.

But some independent analysts think the Trump administration has misread Kim’s intentions, interpreting his commitment to eventual denuclearization as a promise to immediately surrender the country’s nuclear arsenal and dismantle its weapons factories.

“We have this backward. North Korea is not negotiating to give up their nuclear weapons,” Lewis said. “They are negotiating for recognition of their nuclear weapons. They’re willing to put up with certain limits, like no nuclear testing and no ICBM testing. What they’re offering is: They keep the bomb, but they stop talking about it.”

Why the simplistic dichotomy between good vs. bad? We should judge both for their actions.  It really is sad that people seem willing to overlook concentration camps with emaciated political prisoners and disgusting human rights abuses in the North. Kim Jong Un is a scoundrel who has it in his power to free these people who are undergoing torture. If reports are even slightly accurate, some of these people were born in the camps while sometimes three generations of a family had their freedom taken away. It is so disappointing that in their hatred for Trump so many people seem to have completely forgotten how North Korea treats its own people. And yeh, I pretty much despise Donald Trump. I support opposition to him in almost all ways. But I will never whitewash what a disgusting regime rules in Pyongyang.

It is hard not to be cynical here..

Trump does have a huge amount to gain personally (and I think we all know at this stage that is enough for him) here. With 2020 looming and his re-election show revving up a few levels across the States he will be only too aware that positive news (however shallow or otherwise) from the upcoming summit can be capitalized upon and once again showcase his great strengths of peace keeping. In his state of the union address he basically said the Koreas would be in a full blown war were it not for him.

NK can use this kind of self-indulgence in its favor here and seek way more concessions that it may otherwise be in a position to do so.

What do you mean "without logic"? Talks about improved relations often lead to improved relations. Without such talks, there are no improved relations. There's reason to believe that these talks won't work out, but there's no reason to believe there's no possibility of these talks working out. Let people get optimistic if they want to.

Yeah I can't understand these anti nuclear policies. When we found out lead in paint was poisoning people we didn't phase out paint, we invented safer paint. Same thing with cars, they've continuously gotten safer. All the evidence says we are capable of building nuclear containment systems that would have held up even under extreme duress like the Fukushima daiichi plant suffered. And frankly in a small country like Korea there's so little space for solar or wind power that they have no choice but to use small footprint power generation. And because they don't want to pollute the air any further nuclear really seems like the best option. Korea isn't even earthquake prone like Japan or Taiwan!

Things said in the editorial are not accurate. The Taiwan government already said they will effectively ignore the referendum result and continue to retire nuclear power plants. No policy change.

South Koreans getting the government they deserve and voted for.
What has this government done that has been done right? Anything? I can't really think of anything other than the fake peace deal where they got to set up the friendly photo op sessions with a smiling fat dictator. But the nuclear missiles aren't going anywhere.
---
Just wait until the brownouts and blackouts hit Korea also. And then see the shocks of electricity bills - the government cannot subsidize the low prices forever with tax money, so they're going to have to raise the prices pretty soon. We've already lost so many high paying jobs due to the mothballing of the plants, but that's going to snowball in the future if businesses are saddled with higher costs to use electricity. In turn, higher electricity bills will lower South Korea's per capita purchase power income as well. Korea will also end up spending more money importing more oil, natural gas, and coal to compensate for the losses so more import bills. The country is getting poorer, not to mention this has only made the coal power plants to work harder pumping out more air pollution.
---
It's important to note that the Fukushima daiichi was an old model plant that was being phased out when the worst luck hit. It wasn't an example of what we can expect to go wrong from a nuclear future, it was a warning that we need to always move forward when it comes to adopting new technologies.

Also Taiwan is full of earthquakes, and South Korea is not.

>Satellite images indicate North Korea is deceiving Trump

I'm no fan of Trump ... but it's silly to suggest he's being deceived about this.  The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has - bar none - the most sophisticated satellites in the world.  Trump gets briefed by them regularly and gets the best information you could ever get as far as intelligence gleaned from satellite imagery.  Trump surely knows more than CSIS regarding what's happening with North Korea's nuclear weapons development.

So why does Trump say stupid shit like his efforts have led to neutralizing the North’s nuclear threat?  I suspect that is just Trump being the blowhard that he's always been.  Or maybe he thinks he's pulling a fast one on Kim Jong Un and is planning on playing "gotcha" at the next summit.  Who knows?  Whatever the case - he's being provided the intelligence and knows the truth regarding North Korea's nuclear weapons development.
---
I don't mean to be condescending but you should perhaps reflect on this. You jumped straight in implying this report was an attempt to smear Trump yet you presented zero evidence and were wrong about the source of the data. You then claimed that the NYT was not showing Trump respect by referring to him as 'Mr.'. You came here with an agenda yourself and attempted to discredit the article and the NYT.

TITLE: [serious] Koreas ways in nuclear energy

POST: Greetings from Germany,

first of: I am not really interested in any clarifications by major news outlets or political parties. I would like estimates and general feelings from actual citizens. Thank you.

I just have seen the Movie "Pandora" from 2016. At the end the movie mentioned that Korea is the country having the highest density of nuclear plants across the globe.

I never really got into researching social thought process and view of countries way closer to Fukushima than Germany and Japan itself.

Some documentary in Germany finds very clear words for the distasteful way Japanese government and energy business handled and handles the entire topic.

I am very interested if someone could report for her/himself how they felt having a plant blow up pretty close to them. Or if they know any reports or diaries of Korean origin written and published over that time until now. They can be unobjective, full of fear or risk denial, I would like the full board of available emotions.

Thank you for taking your time to read this.
Thank you even more when replying in what form ever.

Have a nice evening.

COMMENTS:
Another German here. Purely anecdotal, but in my experience Koreans generally don't worry much about the risks of nuclear energy, but the general trend seems to be to move away from it slowly. I have a friend studying nuclear science and she says nuclear energy here has no future.

When Fukushima happened all my Korean friends told me not to go to Japan and not eat Japanese fish because it's so dangerous. I personally thought that had more to do with resentments against Japan than against nuclear energy.
---
I too watched that movie when it came out, but I honestly felt the anti nuclear message was too forced.

I know how dangerous nuclear energy is, but we don’t have any other way. No geothermal, no wind power, all the little creeks and rivers are riddled with hydraulic generators already, solar power is too weak. We’ve crammed this small peninsula with all we got and nuclear power still takes up more than a third of our generated power.
---
Pandora is now the most hated movie in Korea. 
When President Moon announced his anti nuclear energy policy, he cited the fact that he cried watching Pandora as a reason. 

Experts were quick to point out that the movie was no scientifically supported, and there was no real danger of a reactor " blowing up", as opposed to a leak, which was what happened in Fukushima. Even then, the Japanese reactor only melted down because of their disel generators being waterlogged. Korean SMART reactors are designed to withstand category 5 earthquakes, and are encased in a concrete pill shaped shell that contains everything essenstial to a reactor, and is completely safe even if tossed around. Newer reactors are safer, so we need to be building new reactors and decommissioning old ones. 

But Moon is doing the opposite. Halting construction of new reactors, and putting decomissioned reactors back into service because it turns out the energy demand cant be solved with renewables alone. This ironically increases risk of nuclear accident tremendously

So now Pandora is the movie that ruined Koreas nuclear energy industry, which was one of the best in the world. Because of Oandora we lost contracts in Middle East and losing the contract for Moorside in england. The president knows nothing about how industry ormeconomy works and time and time again made decisions based on fantasy, not fact. He said we will reduce Nuclear and increase renewables, like solar, and go eco friendly. The result is anti nuclear, and increasing coal and lng, which is not eco friendly, increases emissions and fine dust, while solar proved pitiful. 

Germany is always cited as example of successful anti nuclear energy policy but its been proven that Germany imports tons of nuclear power energy from France, and energy prices hike due to anti nuclear policy. Korea is 70% mountains. For solar panels we need to deforest Seoul size of mountains to get 1 reactors worth of power. Deforesting mountains causes floods and erosion, and monsoons ended up destroying solar farms in deforested mountains when avalanches of earth occurred. 

We have been developing pyroprocessing technology which recycled nuclear waste and reduces their half life. 

Please Germany talk some sense into the current government.
Pandora now became the movie that ruined Koreas energy future.
China is building 100 nuclear reactors on its eastern coast and even if 1 of them melts down all of Korea will be irradiated, so theres really no point de nuclearizing for sake of safety.
---
There's a lot of fear-mongering against nuclear energy here, on the news and in newspapers. Don't know why, but there is.
---
That is interesting, I actually expected there to be more serious interest towards that topic. Did never occur to me that the little things they said would be due to old resentments.

People are hopeful for a peaceful solution. That's very different from a deception. Nothing really has been given up by US/SK this time by trying a diplomatic approach.

People act like they're so smart by saying, "see I told you they were lying". But everybody knows that's a possibility. It's a just a matter of trying diplomacy.

Only the dumbest people simplify a complex situation.

trying the same kind of diplomacy after it has failed the last 5 or 6 times? Dont be naive, people are cynical for a reason.

The US military industrial complex is not interested in peace breaking out anywhere.  They are in the "war business" and that means they need to keep having enemies; here and there to ensure their ongoing profitability and viability.  They "invest heavily" in lobbying the House to ensure their goals and objectives are met and they need a large and growing military and they ensure the US has "enemies".

Of course: DPRK has to retain nuclear capability to have any negotiating power at all. Full decomissioning will likely only happen after reunification.

> there's no real reason for South Korea to keep fighting North Korea, at all. Only US has any reason because they want denuclearization.

So nobody in South Korea wants denuclearization? It really doesn’t worry South Korea at all that their northern neighbor, a totalitarian dictatorship with explicit ambitions to unite the peninsula, has access to a massively destructive “trump card”?

I’m sorry, but this is completely ridiculous. A correction would be that “**I** don’t want denuclearization”.

>  Best way to help North Koreans is for them to improve their economy and for them to change internally

How does this “internal change” happen in a country with a completely closed off and totalitarian political system? Economic improvements have not always correlated with increased political freedoms.

What a surprise /s

Wipe out is a bit extreme, but yes, they can cause a lot of deaths, injury and damage.  However, conventional weapons concerns and nuclear weapons concerns are not mutually exclusive.  The nuclear threat to the United States itself is relatively low, their testing wasn't quite as successful as you're making it sound.  That said, whether its South Korea, China or even Russia - the testing of large scale nuclear weapons is of concern.

TITLE: U.S. intelligence officials, citing newly obtained evidence, have concluded that North Korea does not intend to fully surrender its nuclear stockpile, and instead is considering ways to conceal the number of weapons it has and secret production facilities, according to U.S. officials.

COMMENTS:
Why do you say that people see Kim Jong Un as vulnerable? Wasn’t he the one threatening the world with nukes? Again, how much are you getting paid to post pro-NK/China/Russia propaganda? Are you paid by the word?
---
The US got "beaten" in the Korean War? My goodness sometimes I wonder what--or if--you read. The United States opted against using nuclear weapons to decide the conflict which ended in stalemate almost exactly where it had begun. The US never considered nuclear weapons in the Vietnam War, which the French started against the express wishes of the US at the time, when they wanted to stay out of it. The OSS trained and supplied Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh in the beginning, and it was the US--not China nor the USSR--whom Ho first went to for help. If North Korea had not invaded the South with Soviet assistance, there is no reason to assume the US would ever have gotten sucked into that war in the first place. They initially refused to support Diem, a fascist carbon copy of Syngman Rhee, and it was only after communist aggression in Korea that the US fell prey to Cold War ideology instead of treating conflicts on a case-by-case basis, as they had been in Vietnam up to that point.    
  
Libya had already fallen in the path of the Arab Spring and, after the Libyan UN rep asked the UN for intervention against the regime, citing crimes against humanity, the NATO (with the U.K., France, and Canada in addition to the US) strikes against the regime were a response to Gaddafi openly and defiantly slaughtering his own people in an active conflict.   
  
It's a stupid and ignorant comparison, but I'm sure North Korea is quite proud whenever they suceed in getting someone to repeat it mindlessly. If, for whatever reason, you *want* to promote North Korean propaganda designed to deflect criticism from what they are really doing and have been since the nineties, then you should be proud.  
  
If not you should consider reading more about what you have just demonstrated fundamental misunderstanding of. Try reading a book instead of the Hankyoreh--that would help.
---
It will be interesting to see how the US and SK admins handle this then.

And then if they up the ante (even just a little) on NK how does Kim and his regime react?

Trump and Moon (esepcially) have invested/gambled a lot in this and have a lot to lose if things go pear shaped. They will be scampering to paper over any cracks to begin with.
---
Bamboozled again!
---
unlike iraq, NK actually build the nukes. 

Libya would be a better comparison. Kaddafi was promised protection, gave up nukes, then the Americans killed him.

If they were going to trick somebody, they would have waited till they got some kind of aid which wasn't even at the bargain table in the first place. Just lifting of sanctions.. Stupid shit..
---
Unpleasant but not unexpected, considering there is no formal deal in place. Factually speaking, there is only an intent of denuclearization agreed upon between the parties, with a few good-will measures put forward for PR (KORUS stopping war games, NK blowing up a testing site and stopping anti-US propaganda).

NK was always going to drive a hard bargain. I don't think they would give up enrichment without any concessions.

Oh I remember when Koreans were all over the jesuischarlie movement on social media and then a korean candidate to a French singing audition was treated with racism and koreans suddenly turned their backs on the movement and many said they regret promoting it in the first place because the french dont deserve the sympathy. 

This and that makes me think. Jesuischarlie is pretty disturbing in that the way its framed, it almost guarantees it will recieve more attention than Iammohammed, despite many more non whites dying from terrorism (sometimes western military adventurism), yet its more buzz worthy story if a bread loving white french person died, rather than a middle easterner, African, or Asian

Sorta disappointed they did this. I woulda thought liberals would take a softer stance. To suggest that somehow the one off summit should  denuke NK completely and permanently is just setting expectations way too high, and frankly suggesting the summit should just fail.
---
China sanctions are all that really matter.  90% of NK imports and exports are with them.
---
establishment dems have a stake in keeping NK isolated as well. Much like most politicans in the US

Very few politicans like Bernie and others would be for actual communications and talks with NK. 

Trump's doing whatever he pleases which is why this is a good chance for Korea to get what it wants
---
Unfortunately Schumer is basically setting Trump up for failure on purpose for likely political reasons. Schumer is asking for concessions that North Korea is very unlikely to give, basically dooming the meeting and preventing Trump from scoring any political victory for the upcoming midterm elections. I have the feeling that if Obama were in office then the Dems would have much looser standards (and of course the GOP would be hardliners). 

We need peace on the peninsula but all the American politicians care about is notching a partisan victory in D.C.

No. And unlike China and Russia, we devote a lot more resources to actually being mission capable rather than looking pretty and marching perfectly. Waste of time and resources.

Precisely this. It's his guaranteed seat at the "take us seriously and don't you fucking invade us" table. There was absolutely no way Trump going all Chamberlain with Kim would make him stop developing.

I just asked Kim on Yahoo messenger, he said nah they're straight

Look. Getting a Nuke is North Korea’s only way to continue existing. They will try, no matter what, to get that intercontinental nuke. So yes they are continuing in development because Kim doesn’t have any other choice if he wants to stay in power.

TITLE: What would happen if we declared North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Russia and China as friends and genuinely treated them as such?

COMMENTS:
It would be absolutely disastrous. It'd give all our enemies and rivals free reign to kick us in the balls. America has to atleast pretend it cares about freedom and democracy in order for us to carry weight. If we just shacked up with people who use slave labor, run concentration camps, and persecute minorities for shits and giggles it wouldn't look good on our resume.
---
Policy isn't as simple as saying "country A is our friend and country B isn't".
---
Everyone probably thinks the US government spokesperson that says/announces this new policy is drunk/high and ignores it.  This is also probably the governments explanation unless your using magic to convince the US govt to make this change.
---
They'd take advantage of us, our allies, and the rest of the world.
---
Likely only Cuba works out for the better. Now in theory we could bury the hatchet with Iran, but outside countries would be livid. Specifically Saudi Arabia and Russia. There's a struggle between the Saudis and Iranians for political dominance in the region. I don't know if those two are capable of being friends. 

Now one of the key themes to Russian foreign policy pertains to buffer states. They love their buffer states. While Russia and Iran don't share a border, it's pretty close and connected by former Soviet states still within the Russian sphere of influence. Whether or not Iran would actually accept a "friendship" with the US is pretty much contingent on their loyalty to Russia. 

Israel is also going to be like "yo what the fuck?". But I can't see how any of this would be conceivable without some sort of momentous diplomatic "coming to terms" between Iran and Israel. Sure there was one time Israel sold weapons to Iran in the 80s, but that was the high point of their post-1979 relations.  

China and Russia, I don't think anything changes. They want growth, they want to be the kind of superpower America is. On principle, the US doesn't want this. But with China there's so much between the two economically that it's a mutual disinterest to fuck with each other. Russia on the other hand is a very different scenario. No major superpower would trust on blind faith that they'll stop at Eastern Europe and Central Asia. 

North Korea is a bit of an anomaly. The very essence of the regime is being anti-West. I'm cautiously optimistic about how Trump has dealt with them, but I'd hardly consider them even capable of being trustworthy.

If they don't (which I doubt they will but we can always hope) he will go on a twitter rant and put sanctions back on. I don't know what else could happen. He could theoretically launch a nuke but everyone in the white house would oppose him and I doubt he would want it either.

Blame it on Clinton and Obama.

Claim he never said that they would denuclearize.
---
I cannot see us doing anything like that unless we coordinate with China. No President would want to do that though as we would be sacrificing our alliance with South Korea (as we would likely still have to give North Korea to China as a buffer-state in some form).

More directly the strategy of this situation leads to a stalemate. Everyone will lose a lot if there is a war (though the North Koreans will lose more). Until Kim Jong Un dies, gives up his nukes, or is removed from power: the strategic situation leads to all sides being ready for defense but never attacking.

North Korea is like a school bully doing his best to extract as much lunch money from others.  In years past the US has gone along with it, giving NK food and fuel to temporarily placate them.  NK is unlikely to do anything beyond saber rattling with Trump.  Our military could incinerate all of NK in about 45 minutes.
---
"America is the bully" is a very recent development. The current administration has been more bullish on the world stage than any other president in recent memory.

Saying that the US "bullies" the PRK is misleading too. It's not like they're just sitting around, minding their own business, and generally being peaceable and friendly. The Kims are a family of brutal, unstable dictators that commit unspeakable atrocities against their own people for no reason. When the US gets aggressive with them, it's for a good reason.

I'm cautiously optimistic only because Un isn't as crazy as he'd like the world to believe. He might be an evil sonofabitch, but I don't think he buys his own hype like his old man did. His options are limited and severe. I don't think there will be a rogue state North Korea 100 years after the war, and I don't think he does either. 

That being said, nukes are a very, very good insurance policy against getting freedomized if you're not going to play ball with the US.

That would be the worst case scenario involving North Korea in general. I disagree that's a feasible outcome of the talks. 

Thankfully one of the leaders involved isn't completely off his rocker.

I know it seems like the Idiot-in-Chief might be crazy or stupid enough to kick things off, but rest assured that neither he nor this government have any intention of taking such a drastic plunge. Trump doesn't actually want to rock the boat, he just wants to stroke his own ego.

TITLE: Trump agrees to end military exercises with South Korea. Reactions?

POST: https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/12/trump-kim-meeting-press-conference-637544

Seems like another example of kowtowing to the Chinese, for nothing in return?

COMMENTS:
The decision to not do military exercises can be reversed at any time. It's not as big of a concession as people are acting, and it's kind of disturbing the way people are looking for ways for this to be a failure. I mean, should Trump have only ceased joint exercises in exchange for complete denuclearization? In exchange for halting exercises that could be reinitiated at any time? Come on, now.

We're trying to avoid war here. 

The only issue I had is that supposedly according to NPR, the South Koreans weren't in on this decision, and that's pretty fucked up. 

But I see this as a temporary decision intended to keep the dialogue going. The situation isn't the same as 5-10 years ago.

The irony to me is that over the last few years, Redditors and generally liberals were complaining about those war exercises (which I think have been consistently exaggerated as being provocative). And now after this meeting, people are suddenly repeating verbatim the line that we gave up these military exercises "for nothing".
---
It doesn't actually end military exercises with South Korea, it is more or less we will not perform large drills on the Korean peninsula as long as things are progressing positively. This does not restrict training with South Korea and it does not restrict the South Koreans in military exercises with the United States outside the Korean peninsula, like RIMPAC.

Keep in mind, the goal is for North Korea to no longer be a threat to the South and anyone else; if this step goes there then discontinuing drills on the Korean peninsula is fine. However, we have been here before and if History repeats, then it will not last long.
---
> The only issue I had is that supposedly according to NPR, the South Koreans weren't in on this decision, and that's pretty fucked up.

That's what stuck out for me as well. That seems absolutely crazy. Not only did SK have no say in it, they weren't even *told* about it.
---
Yea just normalized relations with NK and a pledge to denuke. Oh, and we will save millions of dollars not have the war games. There’s that too.
---
Our military exercises with SK were basically just a wastefully expensive dog and pony show to intimidate NK. Putting them on pause as a show of good faith during negotiations seems eminently sensible. I don't really see what the Chinese have to do with it, either.

TITLE: What do you think of Trump's sudden admiration for Kim Jong Un and when he saluted a North Korean soldier?

POST: I hate to be *that guy* but no other president would even dare to do this due to backlash. Why is Trump receiving little to no backlash from his supporters or party?

COMMENTS:
I think the saluting gesture was probably done with North Koreans in mind rather than Americans. It probably blew their minds in a way that we could not imagine. 

I stumbled across some youtube videos one night featuring north Koreans who escaped. They described the propaganda they were subjected to in schools and it was pretty insane. The US and all of the people in it are made out to be the most evil people imaginable, like I'm talking about stories of US soldiers smashing baby's heads with rocks and mutilating women's genitals. Heinous crimes against humanity. They are told that NK is keeping their people locked in so they can't be harmed by the evil Americans. (I think after the famine and more citizens were willing to, and succeeded in escaping, did many people find out this wasn't exactly true, so the propaganda isn't as strong now... but imagine being told this your entire life and then seeing the president of the US salute a NK soldier. BOOOOOOM HEAD BLOWN. I can almost guarantee Trump's gesture was deliberate for that reason alone.
---
Trump was at a meet and greet and went to shake the hand of a North Korean general.

Out of respect for our highest military official (Trump), the general saluted instead.

Trump returned the salute, which is what what higher ranking officers do when saluted by lower ranking soldiers.  Not saluting would have been a grave insult, basically declaring the general to be subhuman.  Trump would return the salute of even the lowest ranking private, to not return a salute... that's unimaginable.

Also I've read that there is report of change slowly but surely occurring in North Korea. Hopefully one day they will have their Berlin Wall moment. (though that's complicated since the DDR is vastly different from the DPRK.

Update: Well, I guess I was wrong about this summit

COMMENTS:
>North Korea *is* pulling our leg like they did in the past.
---
Anyone legitimately thinking anything will change is either ignorant of North Korea or delusional. 

Nuclear weapons for NK has done everything they wanted. It's provided them with a real seat on the international table and provided existential security. Prior to nuclear weapons there wasn't a real domestic deterrence to foreign invasion; the PRC and Russia were the only deterrence and they were foreign. If I was extremely optimistic then I'd expect that the DPRK missile program will stop which would convince the international community that the nuclear weapons are more of a domestic deterrence than an international security threat.
---
I see no harm in it. I don't see way that this could hurt us. I like the idea that people are talking instead of threatening each other.

Keeping expectations low.  Doveryai no proveryai (Trust, but verify) can be a good diplomatic policy and I'm sure the day-to-day people running the negotiations fully understand this.  The hand shakes and meetings between Trump/Kim are mainly just for show.

COMMENTS:
[The American public never really thought about the Korean War](https://www.historynet.com/interview-melinda-pash-why-is-korea-the-forgotten-war.htm).

>Korea has been called a “forgotten war” since at least October 1951 when U.S. News & World Report gave it that moniker. In reality, though, Americans did not so much forget the Korean War as never think about it at all. When the war first broke out, people worried that American involvement would usher in the same type of rationing and full mobilization that had characterized the Second World War. That failed to occur and within a few months most Americans turned back to their own lives, ignoring the conflict raging half a world away. Newspapers continued to report on the war, but with the entrance of the Chinese in late fall 1950 and the resulting stalemate in late 1951, few Americans wanted to read or think about Korea.

You do realize North Korea started the war and nearly won early; the U.S. prescience there wasn't enough for what amounted as a surprise attack and was eventually able to defend Busan till U.N. forces were able to intervene, turning the war.

>Did people expect China to enter the war? 

Chinese Civil War just ended and while there was a potential of them interfering, they choose to chance it by taking all of North Korea. Keep in mind that the NK forces were in full retreat with some regiments entering China, they had only a small strip of mountainous terrain left under control and China didn't like the idea of an enemy at the border. As for the American people, you need to remember that people were still getting news from radio or news reels at movie theaters; they really had no idea what was going on beyond what was presented in those formats... nothing like it is today.

Rhee was certainly an authoritarian and there was plenty of extra-judicial killing during his presidency, but he was no where near Kim Il-Sung in terms of democide.

The South Korean army may have been as brutal, but we'll never know as they weren't the aggressors and we're never moved much beyond the 38th. 

I'm definitely not arguing that South Korea was a paragon of democracy by any means, more along the lines of the better of two evils.
---
Pretty much the first big test of the United Nations are a viable multinational organization after the abysmal failure known as the League of Nations.
---
Pretty uneducated answer, to be frank. 

The reason the Korean War happened was because North Korea with support form the newly formed Communist China and the Soviets invaded South Korea. The UN responded due to these aggressions, and the US, being the military power of the world, led the cause. 

If anything the Korean War is amongst the most just wars in modern history. Allowing the communists to just obliterate an alien nation who had already suffered so much under Japanese Occupation would have been such a horrible mark on history.
---
> Regarding the latter, South Korea was a brutal, awful dictatorship not really any more humanitarian than the North right up through 1980 or so.

South Korea's Rhee and Park are nowhere anywhere near what Kim Il Sung was with his system of gulags and repeat human rights violations that exist to this day, even after his son and grandson have come to power

> Photo by Elizabeth Shim/UPI. SEOUL, Aug. 27 - North Koreans resettled in the South are viewing diplomatic engagement with the Kim Jong Un regime more favorably then they did a few months ago - before South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with the North Korean leader during a historic summit in Panmunjom.

> Jeong-cheol, a North Korean defector who spoke of his experiences during a speech competition hosted by Seoul-based Teach North Korean Refugees on Saturday, said many North Korea watchers are too preoccupied with politics and the North&#039;s weapons program.

> &quot;If we want North Korea to change, we need to change the way we look at North Korea,&quot; said Jeong-cheol, who like all the defectors who spoke Saturday was identified only by his first name.

> The Central Committee of the ruling Workers&#039; Party has decreed that North Korea will not relinquish its nuclear arsenal, which it termed a &quot;Precious legacy&quot; of the country&#039;s late leaders, according to local sources, despite an earlier pledge by party chairman Kim Jong Un to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.

> North Korea began acquiring the basic knowledge necessary to develop a nuclear weapons program in the 1950s, under Kim Jong Un&#039;s grandfather Kim Il Sung-the nation&#039;s founder-and producing plutonium in the late 1980s under his father Kim Jong Il, before testing its first nuclear device in 2006.

> &quot;The high-ranking party officials were listening to the speakers at the meeting because they were trying to determine whether Kim Jong Un really doesn&#039;t intend to give up nuclear weapons or if it was just part of a ploy to gain leverage in negotiations over the denuclearization process,&quot; he said.

COMMENTS:
Yes.   Shit all over Canada's leader, but empathize with North Korea's dictator.

*What does Putin have on you anyway?*
---
Well I mean Kim is a murderous dictator but at least he's not a *Canadian*. /s
---
So being a murderer is okay as long as you’ve seen it done by people you know? Flawless logic, Trump.
---
He was educated in Western countries, where people didn't walk around naked or murder each other for political purposes.

It's a dumb comparison.
---
I really want say that Trump is just placating Kim to make him more amenable to a deal that gets the North Korean people some relief, but Trump is just too flippy floppy to be sure anymore. 

In any case, say what ever needs to be said to try and get this deal to work, helping all those *millions* of people is worth letting kim dodge justice for now.

>Pompeo told reporters Monday the US was ready to make security assurances to Kim Jong Un.
"We're prepared to provide certainty that denuclearization isn't something that ends badly for them," Pompeo told reporters in Singapore.
"We are prepared to make security assurances that are different and unique than America has been willing to provide previously. We think this is necessary and appropriate," he said.
---
Sounds like maybe he was concerned that a) they were more loyal to the memory of Kim Jong-il than Kim Jong-un, and b) financial corruption meaning they will take advantage of upcoming deals with South Korea if the summit goes well and inter-Korean trade picks up. 

Why do you think he replaced them?

TITLE: Will striking a deal with Trump risk Kim's regime?

COMMENTS:
No. At the end of the day there are far bigger threats to the Kim Dynasty that striking a deal with Trump. Each year there are dozens of defectors that make their way out of NK. There are others who smuggle media into the country, breaking the infatuation that North Koreans have with their leader.  There are images and videos that are smuggled out of NK that all pose a threat to the slim international legitimacy that the dynasty has held. 

The truth his his nuclear ambitions and his own ego ruined his only potential option to hold legitimacy and that was nuclearization. You just  don't get to be a ruler that enslaves your own people and threaten other nations while living in peace. You either have to be a legitimate military threat or you have to moderate and now that nuclearization is off the table he only has one other option.

They won diplomatic validation on the world stage.

No U.S. leader acknowledged and treated any of NK's leaders as equals. Until #DOTARD did.  They figured out how to make him wiggle and dance on command.

They also know that as long as #DOTARD remains in office they will face no pressure to denuclearize.

> The Sanumdong factory produced two Hwasong-15 ICBMs, North Korea&#039;s longest-range missiles, but the U.S. official noted that Pyongyang still had not tested a reliable re-entry vehicle capable of surviving a high-velocity trip through the Earth&#039;s atmosphere and delivering a nuclear warhead. It is possible, the official said, that any new missiles the North is building may be for further testing of such vehicles and of more accurate guidance systems.

It's highly likely that most of that technical equipment was useful for things other than developing nuclear weapons. Can't blame them for not blowing it up.

I'm sure the hardware in question has only one, singular purpose, too. /s

Some of it may be valuable enough to sell, some may be able to be repurposed as is, and some may be able to be broken down for other purposes. It's easier to just assume the worst when it serves one's agenda, though. Never allow your enemy to change, and you can perpetuate a conflict forever.

TITLE: North Korea is moving ahead with its ballistic missile program at 16 hidden bases that have been identified in new commercial satellite images, a network long known to American intelligence agencies but left undiscussed as President Trump claims to have neutralized the North’s nuclear threat.

COMMENTS:
>White House national security advisor John Bolton – who has taken a hardline on North Korea in the past — said Pyongyang's arsenal could be dismantled in a year.

I am not so sure. Nuclear weapons are important for Kim because they keep him from being destroyed by other countries. I don't see him giving them up anytime soon.
---
If I were running North Korea (or any unstable country really) I would develop nukes as fast as possible and hold onto them for dear life.  Having nuclear capability instantly legitimizes your country on the world stage and has taken North Korea from a country of starving meth addicted farmers to a country of starving meth addicted farmers that you can't ignore.  

It's extremely dangerous for an unstable shithole like NK to have nukes, but it's one of the only things protecting them from foreign interference.  If you were a small, vulnerable, strategically important nation on America's bad side, would you feel safe?

There is no way on God's green Earth North Korea is going to give up their nuclear capabilities.

Especially when the President of the United States has demonstrated a lack of commitment to honoring nuclear disarmament deals-- just look at Iran. No way I would halt a nuclear weapons program as a part of a deal with the United States now if I were running a dictatorship with strained American relations.

To the people shitting on all positive signs: what exactly were you expecting? An instant surrender? 

That's not how any of this works.

This is a positive signal. Just a signal. No, it doesn't mean Kim's about to lube up, and assume the position. It just signals that he's still open to further negotiation and is willing to demonstrate this willingness.

Not American, but if I remember correctly Obama was criticised by liberals for his actions in Syria.

As an outside observer it seems to be a big difference between the two sides, less liberals will vote for a candidate they disagree with (Clinton), compared to Republicans who will bury their heads in the sand and happily argue completely opposing points on a day by day basis.

Too many people see an election cycle as something their side should 'win', as opposed to a process that should be for  finding out who is best suited to run the country.

This is a pretty clear win for North Korea. They knew that they could get Trump to sing the praises of their murderous dictator by being nice and licking Trumps boots for 6 to 7 minutes. They make some meaningless concessions, which Trump characteristically oversells, then North Korea "cheats" (as expected) and Trump looks like an idiot, further undermining US credibility and influence. Well played DPRK.
Trump does OK when he is screwing over (comparatively) powerless models and flooring contractors, but performs poorly in the big leagues.

South Africa and Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons for much different reasons.

A) South Africa gave them up because they had no enemies that they would use them against to justify the cost

B) Ukraine didn't build their nuclear weapons and gave them up under the promise that they would be recognised as a sovereign country and not threatened militarily by Russia (look how well that turned out).




NK has no reason to give up nuclear weapons, they've got multiple nuclear powered enemies and they've already seen what happens when you give up the nuclear weapons you already have.

As they should. They saw what happened to Gaddafi and now Libya as a whole, and logically did not want the same to happen to them

It's SOOOO easy to flatter Trump, as a dictator. You already appear great to him because you're what he sees as a strong leader. You then show him how much your people respect you (because you'll kill them if they don't) and put him in the nicest palace or whatever.

Boom - he loves you. You're everything he wants to be. It's why he has heaped praise on basically every dictator in the world and why he hates Democratically elected leaders that are pragmatic, reasonable and honest.
---
Yep, the only sovereignty respected by the West is that provided by nuclear arms.  Syria, Libya and Iraq all had nuclear programs, and all eventually became targets of Western aggression.  Pakistan on the other hand can shelter Bin Laden after the US has stated it will go after anyone providing safe haven, and then gets to move on like nothing happened.

TITLE: North Korea may have made more nuclear bombs, but threat reduced: study

COMMENTS:
North Korea only has nukes as a preventative measure. They only get used if someone invades.
---
Did you read the article? It doesnt matter how many nukes they have if they cant deliver them reliably. Thats like having dozens of bullets, but no functioning gun
---
That makes no sense at all
---
It is very dangerous to let North Korea have nuclear weapons. How to control it is a very big challenge we need to face and discuss
---
Not if Peace on the Korean Peninsula becomes a thing.

China has Nukes, America has Nukes, Russia has Nukes, India has Nukes, Israel has Nukes, the UK has Nukes, most developed countries could have Nukes in a matter of weeks if they really wanted to.

To me, the threat behind North Korea isn't the idea of those spooky scary Korean-types having Nukes. It's the fact that they shit themselves and threaten to bomb Seoul once or twice a year. Bear in mind, of course, they are still technically at war, they're just engaged in what must be the world's longest ever armistice agreement.

If the current trend of that whole situation chilling out continues, the fact that they possess Nukes would become no more or less threatening than other countries that do.

Now, I'm not sure how well the One-Nation-Two-Systems idea they subscribe to would work. They would have to loosen their grip for it to really stick, and if they loosen their grip, what prevents South Korean carpet-baggers from rushing North and North Koreans running South to have a go of it in Seoul, coming back and saying "So. Uh. Why don't we have that sort of shit here?"

I imagine it would have to be done slowly, carefully, and delicate, but eh. It could happen, as long as the political will to make it so is mustered up.

To quote an article in NK News "Denuclearize may not be possible. Peace is."

You know, it's worrying, but not for the reasons one might think.

Honestly nuclear proliferation is pretty much inevitable. This is 1950s tech we're talking about, any government that wants to develop a bomb can probably do it in a relatively short time frame. The delivery vehicles would be crude, but still enough for a credible local deterrent.

It is an open violation of Article 6 of the treaty.


 Each party "undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a Treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control".

Modernizing and upgrading their existing nuclear stock piles is not disarmament or cessation of the nuclear arms race.
---
Beyond the colossal expense, the program appears to be a flagrant violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty
---
Meanwhile the U.S just ignores it's own agreement to it. Also not that anyone cares but NK and China have repeatedly offered to freeze and end all nuclear programs in exchange for making the Korean Peninsula a [nuclear weapons free zone](https://nautilus.org/napsnet/napsnet-special-reports/engaging-dprk-in-a-verifiable-nuclear-weapons-free-zone-addressing-nuclear-issues-of-the-korean-peninsula/), which the U.S [rejected](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/world/asia/china-north-korea-thaad-nuclear.html) because then we can't practice our "regime change" drills if we agree to it. Drills like flying our now nuclear capable bombers near the North Korean border(the same bombers that flattened NK in the 1950's and blew up NK's dams, which was a war crime people were hanged for at Nuremberg but is just fine when the U.S does it).

Yes it is, they have no intention to negotiate that until:

"If the US is unwilling to replace the armistice agreement that ended the Korean War with a permanent peace that would ensure the survival of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's regime, Pyongyang will likely not proceed further with denuclearization talks, the source said."

Which seems unlikely as:

"The establishment of a legally binding peace treaty would require the approval of two-thirds of the US Senate."

> As CBS News correspondent Ben Tracy reported on Monday, President Trump declared North Korea no longer a nuclear threat following his first summit with Kim last summer, but since then the isolated regime has done little to move toward the goal of &quot;Denuclearization&quot; that was agreed to during that meeting.

> Kim hasn&#039;t tested a missile or nuclear device since long before the Singapore summit in June of last year, but Mr. Trump&#039;s administration said right after that meeting that they expected North Korea to take immediate steps to start getting rid of its nuclear weapons.

TITLE: North Korea is hiding nukes and selling weapons, alleges confidential UN report

COMMENTS:
No one saw that coming.
---
Last week, Trump praised North Korea for "tremendous progress" in negotiations, but the source told CNN this report indicates Pyongyang is trying to keep its nuclear and ballistic program ready to launch.
---
This is something people should talk about more often. This is why, no matter what, NK will always have nukes. This is why it's stupid to brag about denuclearising Korea. This is why, even with all the sanctions and embargos imposed by the UN and enforced by the entire world, NK preffered to starve its population and sacrifice its economy for nukes.  
A country with nukes cannot be destroyed.  
Even with all the might of the US, they won't attack for fear of NK wiping out Seoul or Tokyo or LA. The US is Mike Tyson and NK is a wimpy kid, but they both have grenades. If one attacks, they both die.  
Even with all the soft power and subversion in the world, the US or anyone else will never try a coup. Instead, it's now in their interest that NK is stable. If NK breaks into civil war, like Syria, who knows what will happen to the nukes? Imagine the Korean version of ISIS, but with nukes. Nobody wants that.  
That's why that idiot went out of his way to have nukes, it's the difference between life and death. And he won.

I think everyone (except Trump) knew that Kim was never going to give up his nukes.

After all, he only got them in the first place to ensure that he wouldn't be attacked or invaded by the USA, which has always been North Korea's bogeyman. 

Everyone knows that no-one attacks you when you've got nukes, and if you don't have nukes, the USA feels free to drone bomb or invade anyone that doesn't follow their empire's agenda

To be fair, he did get Paul Manafort to work as Chairman of his Campaign for him for 100% free.  It's a true Forrest Gump tale, you know that part at the end where he mows the local high school football field for free and also sells US interests to the Russians.

Ask anyone of his campaign about it now, you know getting your Campaign Chairman to work for free, and they don't want to talk about it.

Wonder why that it is?  This is true Art of the Deal stuff here.  Campaign Chairpeople are usually paid $70,000-150,000 annually.

I’m not sure this is about nukes and rogue nations.

This is about US global dominance and influence. 

China is spreading its influence in Africa and Asia, Russia is pushing westward, and North Korea is seen as a simple fix to bring US dominance back into the black (since it’s clear there will be no progress in the Middle East).

Oh, and USD as a reserve currency is also under attack with the EU trying to circumvent Iran sanctions, and India and Russia agreeing to NOT use USD for recent weapons purchases.

Even US allies are not on the US’s side.

I don't really understand this mentality. Like at all.

Country wants to integrate into world system, potentially loosening hold of dictatorial power and opening up economic opportunities for the populace. 

Said country also wants peace treaty after 60 years of intense war production and defense against largest imperial state in history that has continuously run a propaganda and intimidation campaign against the dirt poor country. All this after losing 20% of their population and every man made structure in the country in what basically amounted to war crimes.

Why would you be opposed to ending this war aside from a knee-jerk reaction of "lol NK"?

TITLE: Japan's nuke experts ready to help defang North Korea

COMMENTS:
North Korea is believed to have extracted plutonium used for weapons from spent fuel at the Nyongbyon reactor. Japan plans to send over experts on uranium enrichment at the Rokkasho reprocessing plant in Aomori Prefecture, the sources said.

Out of concern that areas around the nuclear facilities in Nyongbyon and Punggye-ri, in the northeast, could be contaminated, Japan also plans to provide decontamination technology used at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant after the triple core meltdown sparked by the March 2011 quake and tsunami, the sources added.

People need to go back just a few weeks and listen to Kim. There is absolutely no way he will ever give up his nukes, yes maybe one or two to get some sanctions lifted, but in his words, if he gives up his nukes he will be defenceless against the west and China and Russia.
---
I think he's just parroting what his father said for decades. I suspect the turnaround is due to a drastic change in circumstances. Food supply, perhaps. There were also reports that their testing site literally collapsed. With the fact that they're so cash strapped, any of these occurrences could predicate a total change in direction.

>The overall importance of the Sohae missile site has also likely diminished for Pyongyang, Mr. Narang added, since North Korea, apparently satisfied with its missile design, had shifted to mass production last year.

>Furthermore, Pyongyang has moved in recent months toward solid-fuel missiles that can be fired from a mobile launcher with almost no advance warning—making the need for a rocket launchpad unnecessary, Mr. Narang said. “It has shown an increasing preference for mobile or pop-up test sites rather than static ones” like the one at Sohae, he said.

>Mr. Bermudez, the 38 North analyst, called the move a positive sign, but added: “The question is whether it will be a meaningful development in the long term. That depends on whether they continue to disable and dismantle their ballistic missile production and testing facilities.”

Yeah, and I think it's important that we recognize when something good actually happens during this administration. Obama could have cured cancer and folks on the right would have accused him of grandstanding and complained that he didn't cure Alzheimer's. If Trump does something good, I'd welcome it. I don't want the country to crumble, I want it to succeed, regardless of who is responsible for the success.

Not that I'm thinking Trump will do much that's good. It's more of a hypothetical.
---
What seems to be meaningless here is the news and people’s opinions.  There is so much effort in the news to discredit your opponent and manipulate popular opinion and call t news that nothing released by any “credible” news source means anything anymore.  We don’t know if this is genuine or the beginning to peace and yet the rhetoric from both sides is so predictable and biased that it should make us all sick.  We have de-evolved as a culture into the emotional and intellectual equivalent of teen moms/reality tv stars, screaming “me me me” into a mirrored camera lens we are pointing at our own face in a room full of people who agree with us and never stop clapping.  Trump is a narcissistic asshole.  But that doesn’t preclude him from achieving anything good.  Obama seems like a nice guy but that didn’t stop him from committing atrocities with drones.  Unfortunately we can’t see things as complex or nuanced anymore and will flatly deny anything that doesn’t reflect our arrogant undeserved confidence in every thought that ever crosses our hive mind.

Dear god I miss the idea of moderates who can work together and do something that matters. 

Hey, World full of people, try to open your mind.  Hey, journalists, try to report news, not your political views.

There is no peace treaty just a commitment towards denuclearization from North Korea and the end of war games by the US.
Kim got the prestige of meeting the US president 1 to 1, concessions from the US, legitimization of his regime while keeping the same commitment he declared during a previous summit between the Koreas.

Trump actually hasn't acheieved anything other than praising a murderous dictator and conceding war readiness by stopping war games in the area.
---
Don't get your hopes up this has fuckery written all over it

I was expressing amazement that the whole thing didn't blow up or turn into a narcissistic ego fest. I'm sure the real heros are actually the diplomats that make the first step possible.

If he bothered to prepare, we would be a bit more comfor with this. But since he admitted that he will just feel his way through it, it is merely a photo op with a deranged dictator. We don't hate diplomacy in any way. We do hate that Trump has destroyed out State department and considers himself a diplomat with zero prep or experience.
---
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that Kim Jong-Un sends whole generations of families of his own people to starve and die in concentration camps for minor crimes or speaking out against the state.

Here’s to hoping the NK leader takes the path that China chose in the 70s rather than just using this moment to legitimize his murderous dictatorship on the world stage.  I really hope that good and peace comes out of this.

There is ***Zero*** chance they agree to and comply with denuclearization though... I have a bridge to sell anyone that believes that.

> "Describing the summit as a 'historic' occasion, KCNA reported Monday that Kim would be exchanging 'wide-ranging and profound views' during the meeting on issues including 'building a permanent and durable peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean peninsula' and 'realizing the **denuclearization of the Korean peninsula**.'”

Just in case anybody missed it, that would include the southern half of the peninsula as well. And how likely is it that will happen?

No clue really, but the U.S. pulled nukes out in 1991 ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/10/19/us\-decides\-to\-withdraw\-a\-weapons\-from\-s\-korea/3759ee3f\-e9bf\-4944\-bfdf\-2f9ea727b546/?noredirect=on&utm\_term=.96d6741ddb66](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/10/19/us-decides-to-withdraw-a-weapons-from-s-korea/3759ee3f-e9bf-4944-bfdf-2f9ea727b546/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.96d6741ddb66))  


**denuclearization of the Korean peninsula** has historically meant removal of some U.S. assets (us being a nuclear power) and/or a peace treaty.

No Trump has repeated brought up the cost savings in the long run to pull troops out of Korea.

It will be spun as a cost saving measure but the reality is SK is a prosperous nation that can defend itself. US doesn't want to risk American lives and cities for disaster and have Koreans figure their own problems.

It will be Peace with Honor, Korean style.

That's misleading as it only refers to the trade in goods... Canada imports $26 billion more US services than it exports to the US, thus when you look at total trade in goods and services the US has a surplus with Canada.

They do have one, but besides the physical able to, or unable to fly from dprk to singapore with that, politically it was brilliant.

If he took the DPRK Airforce One, the people wanting the throne would likely destroy the plane on landing/takeoff, but since it's a chinese one, they are going to get under some serious problems if they are going to assassinate that way. I think it was the better move by him in this case.

> The United States announced a complete end to its arms embargo on old war-time enemy Vietnam in May 2016 during a visit to Hanoi by former U.S. president Barack Obama, which paved the way for Hanoi to be able to buy a full range of U.S. weapons and military equipment.

It will be interesting to see if they have a joint presser tomorrow, would be great for both sides progression to unity.

I think that is very unlikely, considering right now Donald Trump has no desire to field questions from the Press.  After all, the whole point of this public display is to distract from Michael Cohen's testimony. Why would they allow him to receive questions that would almost certainly be about that?

TITLE: North Korea's Kim says ready to denuclearize, discussing concrete steps

COMMENTS:
It doesn't really matter. Now the redhats can come scurrying out of their trailers, dropping the syringe and spoon and wading through a sea of empty domestic beer cans on the floor to start screaming about how daddy denuclearized North Korea, and where the fuck is his Nobel peace prize. Of course, only the type of person who could worship a "billionaire" conman as the hero of the working class could honestly believe that one could be so skilled at negotiation that you could realistically say to someone "I'm such a great negotiator, I want you to remove the one thing guaranteeing that I will never come over there and murder you, and I want you to do it to make *me* look good, let's make this happen". 

Imagine living down the street from a man that only a few years ago broke in to a neighbor's house and raped and killed her, and got away with it. And now he's calling up your wife to negotiate getting rid of all the guns in the house because it makes HIM feel unsafe. That's North Korea and the US right now.

If you actually believe Kim is going to denuclearize, then I think you're deluding yourself.
---
So he says he is ready to do something. Isn't that where we left off 8 months ago?

This is deja vu, I swear they said the same crap last time they met.
---
What a stupid fucking opinion
---
NK has promised/said they'd denuclearize like 19 different times now since 1990.
---
Aside from the fact that they promised to do this over a dozen times previously, it was only a few years ago that another dictator who "did the right thing", stopped supporting terrorism, gave up his nuclear weapons, and got into the good graces of the west by helping in efforts against terrorism after 9/11 was rewarded with a literal knife up his ass by those same western countries. You can guess who that was.

If you want to know how likely denuclearization is, ask yourself how likely you would be to accept a request to disarm yourself from a convicted murder that lives next door, so that he can have the option of killing you in the future if it suits him.

TITLE: Trump in "no rush" to denuclearize North Korea

COMMENTS:
I think we could easily de-nuclearize North Korea if we gave in to some of their demands, increase their aid, and work to stabilize their country - the government is indeed cruel but there is no real way to fight them on this, they are truly a "hermit kingdom" and any attempt to remove them by force would result in a military catastrophe resulting in an enormous amount of civilian deaths in the North and South alike, just as in the first Korean War. In addition it would be hell to pay with China and I think any country would has right to be super pissed if someone started a giant war next to their borders without their permission. If anything I think North Korea is China's responsibility, but they do not seem to know what to do with them either - it would be foolish of them to turn on a heavily-armed nation right at their border that can hold its own against intense international pressure. Perhaps you could say it was wrong of them to fund North Korea in the first place, though when you consider the political realities of the Korean War the Chinese had a right then to prevent a political enemy from potentially encroaching on their borders. Though I am no Trump supporter I actually approve of his North Korea policy, but he is only making a good decision for once because he is so easily manipulated by other charismatic kleptocrats. This quite reminds me of Nixon's visit to China, another extremely strange incident and indicative of why bad actors can make good decisions when the political will is behind them.
---
Indeed. The way I see it - Denuclearizing North Korea may be impossible. Even under the sanctions regime, they've kept on plogging on forward, haven't they?

Peace on the Korean Peninsula may not be impossible. If we could achieve that, the threat presented by North Korean nukes decreases. 

*Hopefully* if the war ends (Still technically at war and all that) North Korea would be a bit less militarized and crazy. If they attempted some sort of "Two-Systems-One-Country reunification" deal, I believe the crazy would decrease even more.

If North Korea is just another calm, economically vibrant country, operating as some sort of partner in a union with Seoul, does it really matter if they have nukes? I mean, yes, in theory we want as few Nukes on the world as possible.

However... In this instance in specific? The threat presented by them if North Korea relaxes a bit and becomes a respected member of the international community and peace is the first step to that. It will also open the door for more trade and cultural exchanges with South Korea and The Western World, which will further deescalate things. 

Eventually, it may simply reach a point where people shrug and say "Oh, yes, I suppose the Korean Alliance has some nukes, too. Not as many as Russia and America, of course! They are the big ones!"

It's funny. I'm not a fan of Trump. He went *too* hard on my country during the NAFTA Re-negotiations. But you know what. If he can sort out Korea, that's amazing. I'm actually kind of worried now that if he looses in 2020, his successor might go right back to "Blockade and rattle sabers at North Korea" and all this momentum towards peace (If not Denuclearization) will be lost.

---
It wasn't Trump that blew up the North Korean peace deal during the Clinton administration.  It was congressional republicans.  Newt Gingrich, Graham.  Trump is just nakedly, incompetently, dangerously continuing down the road they started.  This is just what Republicans do.  And on this issue in particular, Trump couldn't have fucked it up this bad with out them.  Every republican you have ever seen is for this.  This isn't Trump, this is just what the party of Lincoln has been since before I was born.  It just used to be wrapped in the shiny paper of respectability, and tied together with a ribbon of plausibility.  But this is always what was in the box. And never anything else.

> The North Korean leader on Tuesday reiterated his determination to achieve complete denuclearization and also called for economic development in his annual New Year&#039;s address, stressing the need to strengthen the North&#039;s defense.

> While Kim&#039;s address included conditions for further talks with the US, Seoul welcomed the speech as a sign of the North Korean leader&#039;s willingness to improve inter-Korean relations and achieve denuclearization.

> With Kim highlighting the need to turn further attention to economic prosperity in his speech, North Korea is also likely to continue to bring up such economic projects as a main agenda - even more than it did last year.

TITLE: North Korea’s Kim Jong Un renews commitment to denuclearization in New Year’s speech but warns U.S. not to “misjudge our patience”

COMMENTS:
I hope he knows that he's not the only reason we have nukes. I'm not saying nukes are good (or bad), but it's a complex issue.
---
Nuclear War?
---
But you are the only reason he has nukes.
---
That's a different guy. I'm just trying to add the convo I guess? You right tho, I stretched it a bit
---
Needless to say, I most certainly do not wish for nuclear war. There should be a bit of expectation of behavior from whomever has been elected to sit in the President's seat. I can understand the whole "tell it like it is" that got Trump elected but, c'mon.

Tbf it makes no sense from a North Korean’s perspective to give up their nukes.

Ukraine gave up their nukes because the US and Russia told them they would respect their sovereignty and we all know how that turned out.
---
The appropriate precedent is Libya. After Qaddafi agreed to give up his WMD programs, the French and British bombed the country to bits and he got killed in some sh*thole. 

Bolton even said that he wanted to apply the Libyan model to NK. If I were Kim, I would like that.

Moon was elected in May 2017 on a platform of warmer relations with the North. Months after that, fuckface was still tweeting about fire and fury and little rocket man. The summit was a publicity stunt, a photo op to feed trump's ego so American press would marvel over him for a few days. He secured no policy or diplomatic victory from it and the world would be no different had the meeting not taken place.

> North Korea said Thursday it will never unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons unless the United States removes its nuclear threat first, a bombshell statement that could rattle a fragile diplomacy between Washington, Seoul and Pyongyang to defuse the nuclear crisis.

Bombshell statement that mirrors pretty much everything NK has ever said about the topic. They always talked about denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. It's insanely naive to think anything else would be on the table. There's obviously not much if anything to like about NK, but they're absolutely spot on with their assessment that nukes are their greatest asset when it comes to making sure they're not attacked or liberated or however you want to call it.

He is offering help to SK since one of its representatives is in Paris. It's not like they jumped in the circle out of nowhere. NK denuclearisation is a win for everyone and France has the expertise as a nuclear power to participate in a common effort.

COMMENTS:
That's because regular ICBMs can still do a lot of damage. But the bigger picture here is the potential of a diminishing North Korean threat. A united, peaceful Korea could be bad news for Japan.
---
and yet its always been one of Kim's criteria for the full denuclearization of the ***whole Korean Peninsular***, even if US media choose to completely ignore that reality.
---
They don’t completely ignore that reality, it’s more that they report conflicting news each day. 
“Kim shuts down nuclear research facility”
“Nope, facility still running”
“Psych, he’s actually shutting it down”
“Not really, there’s a report of continued activity”
---
I'll tell you what Kim's demands are.

1) Peace treaty with the US.
2) Termination of the ROK-US Alliance.
3) Withdrawal of US troops from South Korea (and possibly Japan too).
4) Promise not to come back no matter what happens next.

Which begs the question... What happens next? 

(Be really honest...)
---
almost certainly nothing, because US leadership (Trump, Congress, media, the rich who own the politicians) will refuse to allow the US to submit to, or even agree to,  ***any*** NK demands, and hence the whole thing will stall.

Kim will point at the USA and say "See, they refused to work towards peace on the Korean Peninsular as Trump promised", and he'll be right. Which as probably been his intention all along.

TITLE: Moon calls for swift resumption of NK-US denuclearization talks

COMMENTS:
The best course for... probably everyone, is a semi-unification of the Koreas. Two friendly nations working together with a mutual defense pact.

That negates the need for SK to have US protection, and for NK to have nukes.

There's nothing stopping the two nations forging their own integration and friendship path.

Whether Moon and Kim can pull it off is another question entirely.

I am somewhat of the opinion that the US' continued bluster is aimed at pushing them together rather than forcing the win-lose scenario you note.

Moon is good cop.

Pompeo is bad cop. 

Trump is... either depending on his mood.
---
> the US' continued bluster is aimed at pushing them together

So Trump is playing 4D chess again ?

I don't think anyone is buying that theory any more, most never did.

All the indications from the US, and the Boltons, neocons, Republicans etc  are that they are ***demanding*** that win-lose scenario, and mandate nothing less than 100% denuclearization of North Korea, all without the USA making any sacrifices in any way
---
Why the denuclearization will never happen.
---
It's not really complicated enough to call 4d chess.

The Pentagon is full of strategists. There's bound to even be factions within there where different groups advocate different strategies.

If you'll indulge a bit of **pure speculation** tied in with real events...

The US did some new things since Trump. Perhaps he favoured a different faction's ideas over another?

It is true at every level of human interaction that one really good way to unite people is with a common 'enemy' to at the very least, complain about. Whether it's a shitty boss, or an external threat, if you want people to look past their differences and work together, there's not much more effective than a common enemy.

The US, via the UN cut off shipping with huge penalties (no docking elsewhere for 3-6months), it told Chinese banks directly that they'd be cut from SWIFT (effectively removing them from the global finance markets). 

Add the dick measuring guns-at-high noon 'my button is bigger' twitter fight.

And you get: Kim's first trip to Xi.

Xi probably said something like "my hands are tied, your best option is to deal."

Friendless, Kim probably turned to the only other potential ally, the ex. 

Moon, good cop, probably listened very attentively and mirrored Kim's complaining about Trump. Who knows? I wouldn't exclude the possibility that Moon joined in with genuine bitching. An NK-US nuclear exchange is an existential threat to SK too. It would be completely normal for him to go on a few rants - especially insofar as it aligns with his, and his country's long held goal of reunification - or at least frienship.

And a friendship of sorts is born. United by the external pressure of some asshole across the sea.

It's unlikely we'll ever know for sure if my speculation is close to the mark or on a different planet - but it's plausible, don't you think?

TITLE: U.S. ready to resume North Korea talks, seeks denuclearization by 2021

COMMENTS:
Seoul and Pyongyang have tried many many times to declare peace but Washington doesn’t allow it to happen.
---
Ending the sanctions was implied with the "ability to sell..." part of my comment - I'm sorry that I wasn't clear that the reason they can't currently do so is because of the sanctions.

As for a peace treaty, the only nation they need to talk to in order to have a peace treaty is South Korea.  They *could* unilaterally declare an end to the war today, and I'm sure SK would be just fine with that.
---
Kim's game isn't to get the US to give up nukes - it's to get concessions from all the powers that have levied sanctions against them.  In short, money, food, and the ability to sell the only thing they have an interest in exporting: weapons.

The idea that a greedy, short-sighted and power-hungry person like Trump would ever give up even a single nuke while he's in office is laughable.  His only complaint about nuclear weapons is that the US doesn't actually use enough of them.
---
Are you sure a peace treaty and an end to the sanctions that are crippling their economy aren’t the goal?
---
Kim is going to trick Trump into denuking and then Russia and China are going to swoop in and take advantage of the dumb ass leadership currently running the most powerful country in the world.

> WASHINGTON/SEOUL - The United States said it was ready to resume talks with North Korea after Pyongyang pledged on Wednesday to dismantle its key missile facilities and suggested it would close its main Yongbyon nuclear complex if Washington took unspecified actions.

> The January 2021 completion date was the most specific deadline set in what is expected to be a long process of trying to get the North to end its nuclear program, which may threaten U.S. allies South Korea and Japan as well as the U.S. homeland.

> U.S. officials said the ambiguity about what Washington was supposed to do for the North to close its nuclear complex at Yongbyon gave Kim room to argue that Washington had not done enough for North Korea to follow through on its pledges.

Kim has NEVER suggested the DPRK would agree to unilateral denuclearization. The “total denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” does not mean he was just going to give up his nukes for nothing. It means they expect YUGE concessions from the United States and the South Koreans in regards to military forces. All of the people that think that real progress has been made on the issue of North Korea are either foolish or they are reinforcing the lie for political purposes. This administration’s dealing with KIm and the DPRK are a sad joke.

I guess if you just want everything your way, and aren't willing to offer anything in return, then its kinda pointless even trying to "negotiate".

Trump and the US just want Kim to roll over and hand over all his nuclear capability, without offering anything in return, so I guess that "negotiations" like that aren't ever going to go anywhere.

> &quot;The reaffirmation of North Korea&#039;s commitment in the Panmunjom Declaration to work towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula is a signal that Kim Jong Un may have finally heeded the message that only a change of course can bring a secure and prosperous future to the people of North Korea,&quot; Johnson said.

> North Korea said it would import 200,000 tons of food and produce about 400,000 tons of early crops, but that it would still be left with a gap and from January would cut daily rations to 300g per person from 550g. The release of the undated two-page memo by the North Korean mission to the UN comes ahead of a second summit next week between Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.

I wonder if they are they trying to squeeze Trump here because they perceive that the walls are closing in on him and he's in a more precarious negotiating position.

A top secret U.S. military assessment found that North Korea is still evading U.N. sanctions by transferring oil at sea, and that a coalition of U.S.-led forces deployed to disrupt the movements has failed to dent the overall number of illegal transfers, three U.S. officials familiar with the intelligence told NBC News.

The finding underscores the Trump administration's struggle to maintain economic pressure on North Korea amid a diplomatic bid to persuade Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear and missile arsenal. The smuggled fuel provides a crucial lifeline for the regime's economy and armed forces.

The U.S. Pacific Command assessment, labeled "Top Secret," found that the presence of warships and surveillance aircraft deployed by an eight-nation coalition since September has forced North Korea to adjust its tactics at sea, including transferring oil farther away from the Korean Peninsula and often in other countries' territorial waters.

The  North Koreans are also resorting to smaller vessels to avoid recognition by the coalition's warships and surveillance aircraft, the officials said. The assessment found that while attempts to transfer oil have not decreased, the coalition presence has forced North Korea out of the East China Sea and into more logistically challenging areas to the north and south. That shift could ultimately affect the pace and number of the ship-to-ship transfers, raising the cost of smuggling for North Korea, according to the three U.S. officials.

A U.S. defense official said the U.S. began surveillance flights over the East China Sea to disrupt these illicit transfers on Oct. 19, 2017. Since then, the U.S. has conducted more than 300 surveillance flights. Allied nations began flights on April 30, and have flown more than 200 surveillance flights to date.

Since October 2017, there have been 30 instances when smugglers halted ship-to-ship transfers when observed by coalition naval forces at sea, according to a U.S. defense official.

"We've increased pressure and have been collecting information on these illicit transfers and then feeding them back to our interagency partners for financial, law enforcement and diplomatic action," the official told NBC News.

In September, the U.S. and its allies expanded surveillance of North Korea's smuggling, with an eight-nation coalition, including Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand, deploying warships and aircraft to better spot sanctions violations.

The move came after a surge in ship-to-ship transfers this year, with North Korea obtaining black market fuel at sea — often with the help of Chinese and Russian counterparts. The smuggling flouts U.N. sanctions that strictly limit oil imports. A U.N. Security Council resolution in September 2017 put a cap on refined imports at 500,000 barrels a year for North Korea.

A leaked report by U.N. sanctions experts in August, based on U.S. intelligence, found the number of transfers surging, with vessels turning off the transponders that show a ship's geographic location. Between January and May, North Korean ships made 89 deliveries of refined petroleum to the country's ports, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said in July.

A senior Defense Department official recently described an escalating cat-and-mouse game with North Korea, as Pyongyang adapts its tactics to avoid being spotted by U.S. and allied aircraft and naval ships.

"It's a sustained effort but I would tell you the North Koreans are learning, evolving, getting better so the ship-to-ship transfers are taking place farther away from the Peninsula," Randy Schriver, assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs, said at a discussion this month at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. "So they're getting better with their own attempts to evade, and we're evolving as well in terms of our sustained effort to disrupt that."

The head of U.S. Pacific Command, Adm. Phil Davidson, told a small group of reporters last month that the U.S. has stepped up its participation in the coalition, recently dedicating two ships to the mission and increasing surveillance flights by 50 percent.

Another effect of the North Korean ships moving into waters belonging to other nations is those countries can share their intelligence about the smuggling with the international coalition, the three U.S. officials said.

Schriver said coalition vessels and aircraft have not carried out forced boardings of ships but have gleaned information that allows governments to uncover the smuggling networks.

"What's equally as powerful as boarding a ship is taking a picture of the hull, getting information about the ship involved in the illegal activity, and that allows you to get to the insurers, the networks, the people financing the operation, and so we've been successful with a camera as much as we would be if we were to proceed to boardings."

The crew of a Canadian naval ship taking part in the sanctions monitoring, the HMCS Calgary, reportedly saw several ship-to-ship oil transfers in recent months during its deployment in the East China Sea, with suspected blacklisted vessels taking part in some cases.

The mere presence of a Western warship prompted some smugglers to quickly turn and flee the area, Canadian media reported.

"We noted in a few instances that the transfers would wrap up quite quickly and they would have to escape. So our presence disrupted several of the transfers," said Cmdr. Blair Saltel.

Having survived decades of economic sanctions, North Korea has honed techniques to skirt international prohibitions, using shell companies, illicit financing, stealthy shipping movements, and partners in China and Russia to smuggle in prohibited goods, experts and former officials said.

Well they have human rights regardless of whether North Korea observes them or sends them to political prison for their grandparents failure to clap for kim or something.

They are simply pulling what they think are heart strings. NK chooses nukes over their kids and it is sad sanctions are what makes their choice obvious. What's best for the children of Korea is de-escalation which has thankfully had progress made particularly at the border. However, without progressing towards a non-nuclear Korea the famine and disease their children suffer will be much more as a result of the internal prioritization of world ending weaponry.

The sanctions are preventing major infrastructural projects in North Korea. The North and South want to reconnect their rail and road networks. They also want to reopen the industrial complex in Kaesong. Major shareholders from Samsung, LG and Hyundai visited Pyongyang last week as part of the South Korean delegation, looking for investment opportunities. All of this would create lots of jobs in North Korea and help reduce poverty, but it's currently not possible due to the sanctions.

TLDR 

They have continued their nuclear program, and also increased their efforts to bypass the sanctions "massively" by covertly using ships to transfer cargo at sea instead of at their own ports. 

They were also caught transferring weapons tech to Syria and to the Iranian backed rebels who started the war in Yemen.

Good.  North Korea is in its "faux peace" phase, and that's fine.  Unless the US is prepared for an actual war, which frankly we shouldn't be, then we should try to milk this "peace" phase for as long as we can get North Korea to go along with it.  As long as we don't fall into the naive trap of thinking this is anything other than North Korea's plan, and recognize that it ends exactly when and how North Korea wants it to end, we might just be able to make things decent in the region for a generation.

" The explosions were carried out simultaneously within a four-minute time frame "

Was is simultaneous or over 4 minutes?
---
Wow, they blew 10. Congratulations Koreas on another step toward peace.
---
Detonating these guard posts is actually part of a much wider military agreement between North Korea and South Korea. Other things include demining the area near the JSA, disarming the soldiers at the JSA, setting up no-fly zones along the DMZ and ceasing all military drills close to the DMZ or maritime border. 

These steps have been put in place to prevent a minor clash or provocation on the border that could escalate into an all-out war. They're actually important steps to ensure a peaceful environment on the peninsula while the negotiations are ongoing.

EDIT: removed mistaken accusation of sarcasm.

TITLE: North and South Koreas to each withdraw 11 border guard posts by November, launch joint military committee

COMMENTS:
Come on guys, drop the American politics for a minute. This is really good news! I still don't see how the peninsula can unify via diplomatic means, but if the threats of annihilation have stopped, that's actually a huge step forward.
---
It's sad that the opinion on this issue is split down the political line, when it really shouldn't even be a partisan issue. It's the same situation in Korea as well, the main difference being that it's the conservatives throwing shade at every development of the peace talks because President Moon's party is liberal.

That said, no one wants unification at least in the foreseeable future. The South doesn't want the economic and social burden, and the North doesn't want to give up power and control. The goal of the talks is peace, which is not an unrealistic goal and the progress so far seems promising.
---
This new peace is coming right along. It makes me think there is hope in the world.
---
No one has to admit defeat, and why do you think declaring peace is "at the expense" of NK people? The other option is to not declare peace and those people will be in the same situation if not worse. Hopefully, NK gradually opening up to the rest of the world will also bring more freedom and information to the people.

Too late. It was already done back in January bud.

Neither side won peace.

In fact, this conflict has entered a really bizarre and terrifying new stage; South Korean President Moon Jae In might actually be actually be the one to drag America into a war (or even more strangely, an alliance) with North Korea.

How? 

Moon Jae In has pledged to form a one-country/two-system "confederation" between North and South Korea.

Why is that a bad thing?

Remember when Donald Trump suggested forming a "joint cyber security command" with Russia? Remember how quickly that plan crashed and burned (because it was so obviously an opportunity and invitation for more cyber espionage and election meddling that got Trump elected in the first place)?

Well, a North Korea/South Korea "confederation" would be that times a hundred.

It will leave South Korea massively exposed to North Korean infiltration, political manipulation and extortion, and make it extremely tempting and easy for Kim to use the South as a gigantic human-shield for whatever he does next.

(There's also the fact that Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea, admitted to his East Bloc allies that confederation was a strategy to "peacefully" conquer South Korea)

Even more recklessly, Moon is upholding the ROK US Alliance (which he has the right/power to unilaterally terminate) knowing full-well the risks and knowing full-well Trump is too incompetent/distracted to understand what's happening and do the right thing. There's so many ways this could turn into a catastrophe. 

If North Korea tries to exploit this "peace process" to effect a takeover, and the South Koreans ask the US for help, then the ROK US Alliance charters/treaties will legally obligate the US to go to war with NK to defend the South.

If Kim restrains himself and bides his time, the ROK US Alliance might dissolve eitherway once a confederation deal is signed, as well as any US or International agreements with North Korea.

(Because a "Korean Union" or "Korean Federation" or "United States of Korea" would constitute a successor-state that might not be bound to the same agreements with the *former*-ROK and *former*-DPRK)

If the Alliance charters/treaties are grandfathered into the new "Korean Federation", and Trump is too stupid and lazy to pull us out, then the US would be defacto/proxy allies with North Korea via South Korea (as there is no way to be allies with *half-of-a-state* against its other half; it's all-or-nothing). The security implications for the US are really frightening.

Eitherway, Kim Jong Un might not only get to keep his nukes, but he actually might get to *peacefully* take over South Korea as well (and it will not be possible for the South Koreans to break free of him without a war.)

This "peace process" is a disaster in the making.

(And more strangely enough, it's actually mostly Moon's fault rather than Trump's)

NK shouldn't denuclearize and won't. Their nuclear program means they can finally defend themselves against any external threat. Which is why they're now orienting towards peace, they no longer need to pour their entire economy into defense and looking strong. Everyone knows they are nuclear armed.

COMMENTS:
But trump said they're not a danger any more..*!*

Funny how North Korea hasn’t in my recollection taken any land from anyone by force nor have they claimed any land by intimidation. Yet China is always pulling shit like this nowadays. They build an island in the South China Sea so they can claim international waters as their own. Tibet, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are very touchy subjects in relation to their independence. If we talk to the Dali Lama we have done a foolish and dangerous thing. That in itself implies that China thinks they can tell us what to do and is muscling for Top super power nation and leader of the world. We have poured tons of money investing in these thugs and little shits like them. Then we pay a steep price. Now we have Russia and China jointly working on military exercises.
---
China can tell us to stay out of their way. The West really tried to bring them down in the Opium Wars. We couldn't. We stood by and watched them build their communist system, because we can't control them. I think it's one of the best things about China. Different culture that owes nothing to anyone. That's why they were never colonized/ruined and made to rebuild themselves at our direction. They play a different game than we do, and the West has taken waaaaay more land than they ever have.
---
I understand that you see American imperialism as being the pre- eminent problem in the world however I would counter it is the imperialistic attitude of the wealthy, not just the United States that is the real problem. To reference or imply the Opium Wars of 1839-1844 and the establishment of Communism in 1947 as being the fault/responsibility of the United States imperialism is a little off. Russia, France, and most notably England all had an interest in this. It was England that paved the way for the other nations to get similar economic and trade considerations.

The US and NoKo had worked together on this from '95-'05, encompassing some 33 joint missions and over 200 remains delivered back to the US.

I feel like there’s a misconception about what our military is capable of. It’s certainly not easy, and I can’t imagine an extreme enough circumstance that would justify it in the worlds eyes, much less China and Russia, but a response to a nuclear attack would certainly do it. 
If anything I’ve said comes off as aggressive or hostile, I enjoy a good discussion too! Rare as they are these days on the internet...
---
You need to take out all the hundreds of artillery sites in a massive first strike, otherwise Seoul is at risk.  That's been protecting North Korea since before their Nuclear program.

I'm not going to say you're wrong about the degree of zealotry in North Korea, but I'm not necessarily going to say you're right.  They have a larger army than Iraq and Afghanistan combined, and their soldiers have been indoctrinated.  

I just think it's a big mistake to believe that the US could go in and level the military and bring the country around in 15 minutes.  Why hasn't it been done by now, if it was that easy?

This is a debate we're not going to agree on, but I've actually appreciated the discussion, I don't disagree with everything you've said.

TITLE: North, South Korea hold military talks amid U.S. plan to stop drills

COMMENTS:
I can't tell if you are serious? The reason North Korea started developing nuclear weapons is because America went back on a deal they had arranged all the way back in 94. America has routinely lied on the world stage well before Trump.
---
Oh, both are changing.  However, the US (generally speaking but with Trump who knows) will honor its word and treaties.  North Korea on the other hand routinely disregards them.
---
Curious to know why you think it's North Korea that are changing, as opposed to the other countries involved?

North Korea's official policy for years has been that their weapons program is a response to aggression from the US. North Korea have stated for a long time that they support denuclearisation of the peninsula, but America have been the ones that weren't open to that option. I don't think North Korean policy is changing, they are just getting what they have wanted for the last few decades.

> SEOUL - North and South Korea held military talks for the first time in more than a decade on Thursday, as two-star generals from both sides met just two days after U.S. President Donald Trump floated his plan to halt joint exercises with South Korea.

> The talks came two days after Trump said he would stop &quot;Expensive, provocative&quot; war games with the South, following his historic summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump&#039;s move had caught South Korean officials off guard, but they said a halt in the drills was needed while dialogue with the North was underway.

> Kim Do-gyun, the South&#039;s lead negotiator who is in charge of North Korea policy at the defense ministry, told reporters before departing for the DMZ that he and Ahn would explore ways to ease military tensions and the schedule of a ministerial meeting.

TITLE: North Korea state TV airs footage of Trump saluting North Korean military officer

COMMENTS:
This is fucking hilarious.

Officer: Hello Mr President, nice to meet you *tries to shake hand*

Trump: OH WOW IT'S A MILITARY GUY *reflex salute* THANK YOU FOR SERVING MY COUNTRY

I wish Fox News would treat Trump like they treated Obama. Where are the allegations that he's secretly a North Korean agent, or that he's betraying the country? C'mon guys, this is more hilarious than all of Dubya's goofs put together.

edit: Yes, I know NK dude saluted first, you can stop telling me to watch the video. Trump goofed because he didn't have to salute him back.

I willing to chalk this up to the same shit that causes one to say "you, too" when the waiter says "enjoy your meal." That being said, conservative outlets lost their shit when Obama bowed too low to a fucking allied head of state. If you're looking for the culprit in the case of the divided Americans, it's not Obama and it's not even Trump - it's the fucking conservative pundits who spent 8 years firing up their base with a steady diet of bullshit and cocksuckery.

> As Trump acknowledged that denuclearization would not be accomplished overnight, the North suggested Wednesday that Trump had moved away from his demand for complete denuclearization before U.S. sanctions on the long-isolated country are removed.

> The Singapore agreement does not detail plans for North Korea to demolish a missile engine testing site, a concession Trump said he&#039;d won, or Trump&#039;s promise to end military exercises in the South while negotiations between the U.S. and the North continue.

TITLE: North Korea's three new military leaders are loyal to Kim, not policies

COMMENTS:
This is a weirdly optimistic way to view things. North Korea has no real incentive to scrap their existing nukes (unless it turns out they secretly know they don't work or something equally unlikely), and they have extraordinarily strong incentive to keep them; that is, a genuinely existential risk from their perspective. The recent invocation of Libya as an example just made it all the more obvious. The fact that the top military brass are more likely going to do whatever Kim wishes doesn't change the fundamental logic even if true.

I find it incredibly weird that so many people have decided lately that N Korea is going to agree to do something that they'd have to be completely insane to actually do, especially when making vague promises has long been part of their normal MO.

Edit: and that doesn't even get to the question of how well anybody outside their government actually understands who is in charge there. Reminds me of all the kremlinologists in my youth who'd analyze things like who stood next to whom at the May Day parades to try to figure out who was on the ascent and who was on the way out. None of it was all that reliable. It's reading tea leaves.
---
North Korea has been hosting visits by celebrity sports figures since long before the current Kim took over though, and they've tried to get others too. Muhammad Ali and a bunch of others went in the 90s, for instance. Both Kim and his father are huge basketball fans, and would probably happily accept a visit from any well known NBA player, or even someone like Eric Clapton. His father tried to get Michael Jordan to go, but Jordan was not interested.  I don't really think Rodman's visits have any policy implications at all.

I also don't see any indications that Kim is insane. A sociopathic asshole, perhaps, but a rational actor. So far, he seems to be playing the diplomatic game much more effectively than Trump is, since he has already achieved a longstanding policy aim (direct negotiations with a US president) without giving up anything at all. Never thought I'd see that happen.
---
Aren't they all? Until they get tied to a post and shot, of course.
---
> Both Kim and his father are huge basketball fans

No doubt, but Un seems to have a bit more exposure and willingness to embrace Western culture than his father, you can see that with how his brother was basically excommunicated/assassinated for the whole Disney World thing.

>I also don't see any indications that Kim is insane.

What is being presented as anti-China feelings are really waves of discontent towards Korea’s immediate neighbors. I think potential elements of xenophobia are being missed in the articles analysis
---
Not the same question actually.

46% of south koreans think China is the biggest obstacle to peace and 33% think it's NK. This only leaves 21% for all other countries united.

The question you're refering to is whether they think that a given country wants korea reunification or not, which is completely different.
 
You can want peace and be opposed to reunification, especially if you're a neighboring power, so this might be why they think those countries are opposed. Similarly, 50% think the US doesn't favor unification, which is significantly less but still pretty high.

Also koreans have historic reasons for being wary of Japan.

> Japan&#039;s defence ministry has requested a record budget as it seeks to counter North Korea&#039;s nuclear and missile threats and respond to growing Chinese air and naval activity in the region.

> In its annual defence review, Japan said North Korea continued to pose a &quot;Serious and imminent threat&quot;, having conducted three nuclear tests and launched 40 ballistic missiles since the start of 2016.

> Trump has used North Korean nuclear and missile tests to encourage Japan and South Korea - home to tens of thousands of American troops - to buy &quot;Highly sophisticated military equipment&quot; from the US. Abe has cited Pyongyang&#039;s race to develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles as proof that Japan must bolster its defence capabilities and loosen some of the constitutional shackles imposed after the second world war on its self-defence forces.

> Japan is refusing to alter its hardline stance towards North Korea, claiming the regime poses a &quot;Serious and imminent threat&quot; to its security, despite a lowering of regional tensions following Donald Trump&#039;s summit with Kim Jong-un.

> Some of the tests involved long-range missiles that flew over northern Japan - albeit at very high altitudes - while North Korea also possesses several hundred medium-range Rodong missiles that are capable of striking Japan.

> Japan has stepped up joint military exercises with the US and other allies, including Britain and Australia, and increased orders for military hardware from the US. The white paper was released before the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and his cabinet are expected to approve a defence budget that includes initial costs for a US-developed land-based missile defence system, Aegis Ashore, which will be deployed specifically to counter the threat from North Korea.

He's still building nuclear development facilities. I think there's plenty of doubt.

There is doubt that Trump's photo op did anything but strengthen a dictator.
---
By glad handing him and treating him better than the leaders of the powerful nations that are our true friends, Canada, France, Germany and Mexico, Trump gave North Korea a legitimacy that no President since Eisenhower would have dared to do, and in so doing disrespected the troops who died there fighting to contain the Kims' agression. Kim was able to tell his people that he got Trump to do his bidding by cancelling the joint excercises without getting a single thing in return. I am still waiting for those coffins they hauled to the DMZ to be filled and returned, flag-covered, to Hawaii and the 50 other countries who fought by our sides there, including Canada, France, Belgium, Colombia, Greece, Ethopia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Philippines, Thailand and Turkey, with India, Denmark, Norway and Sweden provided medical assistance. Iran, under the Shah, fought by our sides as well. When will those dead be sent home as well? Trump is the worst deal maker in American diplomacy.

So the country that talked about giving up nukes in the past and didn't comply in any way issued a statement that they would "work towards denuclearisation" without giving up anything and now they are no longer a threat? 

Trump goofed. He should've prepared for the meeting, because then he would've known that this summit, even though it was historical for the POTUS and the supreme leader to meet in person, achieved nothing so far. Opening a diplomatic channel is something I aplaud Trump for. But if he doesn't use it then it is nothing more than a meaningless gesture.

Unless the US works out an Iran deal with NK, this is just a smokescreen.
---
Trump a few months ago: North Korea is literally about to nuke the whole world!

Trump now:  North Korea, what a great place!  I'ma buid some hotels there!

Trump in 3 months: I have ordered the invasion of North Korea because...blah blah blah.
---
You forgot “get Fox News to tell the rubes this every day until the election”

So we’re back to where we were the minute before trump took office and started making twitter threats to NK? And we’re supposed to be happy that Dementia Patient of the United States talked, well, himself down off the ledge?

Hey; at least we don’t have some pesky document to reference here. We have Kim’s word and nothing more. Not a problem for a president who doesn’t believe in contracts.

South Korean here.

American Democrats - stop criticizing blindly. This means so much more to us than you think. Please think beyond your domestic struggles, because this meeting embodies the hopes and dreams of some eighty million people, and please know that I, in no way, support anything Trump is doing to your country.

But we need this. Might be the only good thing he does on the world stage. If this succeeds, we can stop this war that has shackled us for seventy years, extend our railways into North Korea and beyond, and directly alleviate the sufferings of millions of people.

Long-term, the growth of the middle class in North Korea will only accelerate the fall of their authoritarian system. We MUST rebuild and make North Korea prosper for unification to be possible.

Agreed. As soon as it was implied that a war with North Korea would be a 'small war' I knew it would be nonsensical. 

This is a work of fiction and nothing else.

The American military has been cool to the idea of starting war with Iran. I expect that military officials will be even colder to war with North Korea, and so act as a restraining influence.

The question that millions of lives depend on, is whether this influence will be enough. Iraq happened, despite the judgment of the military-intelligence complex, which leaves the possibility of a second Korean War. 

I don't think it will, but the unthinkable is still the possible.

TITLE: Does North Korea have better options than rapprochement with the U.S. (and meeting the U.S.'s terms of giving up its nukes)?

POST: An old adage of statesmanship is that you never give up your weapons if you do not have to.  What if North Korea had followed (or follows) this path:

1)  Halt all bellicose talk.

2) Offer formal apology to South Korea (and possibly reparations) for the various naval hostilities the North has engaged in the past 25 years, including the 2010 ROKS Cheonan sinking. 

3)  Resume as much as possible, without U.S. involvement, amicable relations with South Korea, including relative visits, opening attractions on the border for South Koreans tourists to visit, openly reducing military personnel on the border.  North Korean objective: to *talk past* U.S. officials and interface directly with South Korea.

4) Engage in large-scale expansion of economic ties with Chinese.  Ease restrictions on northern border for business and travel in both directions, though not so much that large scale migration of Koreans north would ensue (which China would not want in any event.)

China is lukewarm about North-South reunification because of the prospect of U.S. military troops stationed in North Korea.  Seems that a broad rapprochement between North and South Korea while North Korea simultaneously evidences distrust/dislike of the U.S. would be welcomed by the Chinese.

North Korea could gradually and calmly put forth the narrative that the departure of the U.S. from the Korean peninsula in the next 20-25 year is best for all parties. 

Granted U.S. sanctions would remain in effect.  But would North Korean actions (above) compel the Chinese to further ignore the sanctions and undertake large scale investment in North Korea--with the inevitable result (10-20 years) that North Korea become the respected actor on the world stage that it wants to be?  And North Korea still has its nukes?

COMMENTS:
I think it is really premature talking about an US troops withdraw. US bases in South Korea are strategic because those are the primary bases in Asian continent and are the closest to Russia and China.
---
In my opinion it would be best to start with a drawdown of North Korea's conventional forces (paired with gestures in kind by South Korea and the United States); the fact that they now possess a modest nuclear arsenal means that North Korea no longer requires their large conventional deterrent to safeguard the regime's survival, so if they're serious about wanting to pursue normalization, that's a place to start along with dismantling their capacity to construct new nuclear weapons. If (and this is a big if) things get to the point where there's no longer a heavily militarized border and the notion of a pan\-Korean confederation isn't just a blue sky pipe dream but a realistic and actionable proposal, then we can potentially discuss dismantling the warheads themselves. Sanction relief and economic development aid would inevitably have to occur at some point in this process, but it's best to hold off on that as long as possible to insure against the possibility of North Korea cutting and running once again.
---
Sounds like Kim/NK made great wins in your post. He gets to keep his nukes and get a good relationship with the US and possibly have them terminate the NK sanctions.
---
Thanks for comments.  I was not aware that the U.S. was OK with North Korea retaining nukes.  (I am not a foreign policy expert.)

>We are still very far to consider N.K. a respectable actor on the international stage. 

Entirely correct, "we" being, of course, the U.S.  The nation that dictates around the world how countries should act (or tries to) and throws around the epithet "terrorist" at a wide variety of actors that it dislikes.

My thinking is that a North Korea self-initiated program of "rehabilitation" *could* seek to reach that goal while omitting the U.S. from the process.  

Certainly it would take much longer, especially with the U.S. led sanctions in effect.  But international support for those sanctions might gradually wane, year after year, upon evidence of North Korea's new path.

(And it seems an open question as to whether North-South reunification will come about.  At this juncture it seems far easier for the North Koreans to adopt the Chinese economic model (with its social controls) than to contemplate moving toward South Korea's full fledged capitalism.)

The upshot here is North Korea *ignoring* the U.S.--something that would considerably irk our self important nation.  I surmise the Chinese would find much to like in such a policy.
---
The US will never stop sanctions preassure on North Korea. As soon as they give up their nukes the focus will be on their human rights record to keep sanctions on them. This is what has been done in regards to Russia; Sanctions on Russia has existed for over 40 years now, sanctions remain whatever the government in Moscow looks like because the end goal of the US is to weaken states the US regards as enemies through sanctions. The pretext of the sanctions matters almost nothing but the US will never end sanctioning the likes of Cuba, Iran, Russia and North Korea. The geopolitical reasoning behind the sanctions will always remain.

TITLE: Other than the Trump-kim summit and the ongoing trade war. What are other ongoing events that are categorized geopolitical?

Well there’s China’s plan to wrap Eurasia into an Iron Girdle and pull some strings.

Some people are playing Soccer and getting angry about it.
---
Well I think getting an opinion article closer to the source is always good. If an event happens in Indonesia I might hear about it from Canadian News first, but then I’d go looking for Indonesian viewpoints, Australian, Filipino or Singaporean for context. Not just any one news source, but when geopolitical events happen you can sort of “Triangulate” them to get a better picture on them, try to get non-adjacent viewpoints (not nessecarily opposing viewpoints).

There’s a difference, opposing viewpoints like the USA/USSR but non-adjacent like how India was in the Non-aligned Movement (adjacent would be Western Europe or Soviet Satellite States). This can help you break through a false dichotomy of opinions, G Bushes “you’re either with us or you’re with the terrorists”. Seeking out those third options can help you dismiss the good-guy bad-guy schtick of propaganda and see countries following their own interests instead of lofty goals that serve as veils.

TITLE: Trump-Kim summit leaves Japan struggling with outdated strategy

COMMENTS:
This OP-ED piece is just trying to lay the groundwork for removal of American forces from Okinawa, from a Japanese professor. Completely glazed over the relationship Japan has with China also. 

North Korea fired a missile over Japan seven months ago. Japan’s strategy is not in question here.
---
The NK threat was one of the justifications for Japan's re-militarization.
---
On the other hand...

What if North Korea does make a deal with SK, ends the official state of war that has existed for the last 60 years or so, as well as giving up their nukes?

Japan should benefit from the elimination of the potential nuclear threat from North Korea. I'm not sure how that qualifies as "struggling with outdated strategy".
---
I am not sure if that is the case, though. Japan pays a very large percentage (80%???) of the cost of US military bases. Cost is the only factor mentioned by President Trump when considering reduction of military presence in South Korea.

But OP is right, the Japan hostage issue is no longer preventing a US/North Korea normalizing relationship in a few years. Japan can no longer paint North Korea as the bad guys. Abe needs to revise his story for changing the constitution.
---
Is a unified Korea a good thing for Japan, though?  The Koreans don't need especially long memories to come up with reasons to keep their defenses ready against the militarized island nation.

TITLE: Trump brushes off Kim's human rights record, saying a lot of others have done 'bad things'

COMMENTS:
We have no reason to believe he will disarm though. The language is much weaker than the six party talks, theres been no mention of CVID, or methods of verification. All we have now is Trump's word, and hes already told us that if it fails he'll ['make up some excuse'](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-says-if-hell-find-an-excuse-if-hes-wrong-about-kim-jong-un-2018-6?r=UK&IR=T) 

This is not an issue that can separated into bits and pieces, Kim's human rights record is a big reason *why* he wanted nukes in the first place. 

Edit: Also we cant forget that they've already agreed to slow down or stop their nuclear arms program in 94, 05, 07, and 12.
---
Of course he'd say that. The United States is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world. MLK said that.

TITLE: Evidently what was agreed to between Trump and Kim needs a lot of work before it becomes reality

COMMENTS:
>The Moon proposal—which has never been reported in U.S. news media—was first floated just 10 days before Moon was to arrive for a June 29 summit meeting with Trump in Washington, D.C. Moon’s special adviser on unification, foreign affairs and national security, [Moon Chung\-in](https://www.csis.org/analysis/impact-player-moon-chung), presented the proposal at a seminar at the Wilson Center in Washington as a [reflection of President Moon’s thinking](http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/799370.html). Moon Chung\-in said one of the president’s ideas was that South Korea and the U.S. “can discuss reducing the South Korea\-U.S. joint military exercises if North Korea suspends its nuclear weapons and missile activities.” He added that President Moon “was thinking that we could even decrease the American strategic assets that are deployed to the Korean Peninsula \[during the exercises\].”   
>  
>Speaking with South Korean correspondents after the seminar, Moon Chung\-in said there is “no need to deploy strategic assets such as aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines during the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises.” Military planners use the term “strategic assets” to refer to aircraft and ships capable of delivering nuclear weapons, to which North Korea have long objected strenuously.  
>  
>Moon Chung\-in suggested stripping those “strategic assets,” which had never been part of the joint exercises before 2015, out of the joint exercises, arguing that their addition had turned out to be a strategic mistake. “Since the U.S. has forward deployed its strategic assets,” he said, “North Korea seems to be responding in this way because it thinks that the U.S. will strike if the North shows any weakness.”  
>  
>Moon Chung\-in told South Korean reporters later that he was presenting his own ideas, which were not the official policy of the government, but that “it would not be wrong” to say that President Moon agreed with them. And a senior official in Moon’s office who insisted on anonymity in talking to reporters [did not deny](https://www.nknews.org/2017/06/seoul-distances-itself-from-adviser-comments-on-joint-military-exercises/) that the idea discussed by Moon Chung\-in was under consideration by President Moon, but said the office had told Chung that his statement “would not be helpful for the future relations between South Korea and the United States.”  
>  
>Another figure with ties to the new government, veteran diplomat Shin Bong\-Kil, [presented essentially the same proposal](http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2017/06/29/65/0401000000AEN20170629010551315F.html) at a forum in Seoul in late June. Shin, former director of the Inter\-Korea Policy Division of the ROK Foreign Ministry for many years and a member of the diplomatic team the Moon administration had sent to explain its policies to the Chinese government, had just returned from a conference in Stockholm in which North Korean foreign ministry officials also participated. Based on what he heard at the conference, Shin argued that offering to eliminate such elements from the joint Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises would provide what he called “huge leverage” to get North Korean acceptance of a nuclear and missile testing freeze.  
>  
>The same week that Moon Chung\-in made the proposal public, President Moon himself argued in an [interview with CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/south-korea-president-moon-jae-in-north-korea-otto-warmbier/) against the Trump administration’s demand for immediate “complete dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program.” Moon said, “I believe that first we must vie for a freeze of North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.”  
>  
>He was suggesting the need to substitute the “freeze for freeze” proposal embraced by Beijing, Pyongyang and Moscow, which would require a complete end to joint U.S.\-South Korean military exercises for a freeze on North Korean nuclear and missile testing—an option the U.S. military has rejected.

COMMENTS:
>The reason is that the Singapore process is, in fact, predicated on the suspension of both North Korea’s nuclear and missile activities and the combined South Korea\-U.S. military exercises and training, as well as the parallel pursuit of North Korea’s denuclearization and the signing of a peace treaty — exactly what Beijing has been advocating. 

[They know.](http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/t1568234.shtml)

The facts have proven that the China\-proposed “suspension for suspension” initiative has been materialized and now the situation is also moving forward in the direction of the “dual\-track” approach.

I would say that it also rests on Trump's (and Kim's) forthcoming tweets
---
So essentially we're at the same place we were before. Kim Jung Un is already misrepresentating the talks to his own people, saying sanctions were agreed to be lifted. 

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/donald-trump-north-korea-sanctions-lift-agreement-state-media-korean-korean-central-news-agency-a8396251.html

Meanwhile Trump agreed to lower military readiness in the region (without consulting even his own military leadership, much less allies) and elevate China's position in any trade talks as they're critical to getting any sort of concessions out of NK. All while Trump has come off desperate for a "win." All in all I'm having a hard time seeing these talks as anything but disaster for the US and their strategic position in the region.
---
Now it's back to the 6\-party talks to get his Russian BFF and Japan friend involved, atleast for denuclearization talks.

For real progress for domestic politics, it's back to 4\-party talks to get a Peace Treaty signed.

COMMENTS:
You are correct. It's easy to get Kim to the table, because he wants to sit at the table with other world leaders. It would legitimize his rule further, demonstrate again to his backers that he can get things done and is a powerful leader, and increase his hand next time he wants to shake down a world power.

Letting him come to the table is therefore something he wants, which makes it valuable enough to demand a concession for.

That's why you ask for preconditions and assurances before inviting him to the table.
---
> If successful there is millions of North Koreans who may get exposed to a world where they discover they've been starved by a regime and had family disappear for the sake of their elites. 

This is the narrative that has been fed to Westerners by the MSM. It's true that the NK is oppressive but the idea that NK citizens are entirely brainwashed and do not know a speck about the outside world is a lie. They know how prosperous SK is, they know about China, they know about America. The ruling power is just too competent at holding the country together for the population to do anything about it.

> That will be a zeitgeist within the country that could lead to a lot of turmoil and refugee crisis that the world may not be ready for. Has any nation prepared for millions of NK refugees in the event the country begins to wake up to the suffering they've endured by their own government.

No chance that would happen. It's looking increasingly likely that Kim will be able to reach a deal and we will see NK following China's model closely to reform the country. 

Observe where the wind is blowing, Japan is desperate to get a say in, Russian FM just visited Kim, Kim arrived on China's presidential plane. NK is already being courted by Major major powers. 

What you will be witnessing is Kim Jong Un going down the history with a comparison to Deng Xiaoping. He'll liberalise the country's economy and make it many times more prosperous while keeping in power. 

China doesn't make empty gestures, the fact that Kim arrived on China's presidential plane and the fact that Trump and Kim are willing to take a photo op means a deal has already been reached, perhaps weeks and months ago.

 >  Has any nation prepared for millions of NK refugees in the event the country begins to wake up to the suffering they've endured by their own government.

Not gonna happen, it didn't happen in China after Mao's death, it would not happen in NK. What you will see instead is a mini China 10-15 years down the line. 

> The other problem is hardliners within the NK government. 

Kim got rid of them.

> I'm very happy these talks are happening but I was under the impression these talks didn't happen for some very important reasons. My understanding was that no matter the outcome there is going to be dire consequences and nobody knows how bad it could get. Every President prior knew to kick this can down the road. I hope it works out but is this a no win situation and is that why previous administrations avoided this while Trump believes his negotiating ability will be enough.

It didn't happen because Liberal presidents are much more ideologically minded, for an American president to meet with NK leader as an equal gives NK immense legitimacy, something an ideological American administration would not do.

Trump did it because he's an anomaly, he cares less about "spreading freedom" and "American values", what he wants are deals that will 

1) GIve him a Win and publicity back home 

2) Money, for both him and his base
---
That's an interesting side of it. That makes me think this isn't about a successful talk. It's about what it would appear like to people in NK.  Kim can go home and say the great leader sat face to face with the American President as you said giving him legitimacy. He walks away looking like a powerful leader who took up the presidents times. It's like two people both with ulterior motives for these talks and neither of those motives are for what they are saying they're there for.
---
The only successful winner from these talks is Kim. Kim got legitimized and he will get to keep his missiles.

There is literally a reason why the last three presidents refused to answer the Kims' call for a meeting.

TITLE: Trump’s Singapore Summit Was a Bust—for the U.S.

POST: Understanding that I view the Trump presidency as an existential threat to world order and a diminishing of American presence on the world stage, nonetheless I believe it is far too early to label the Korean Peace process a failure or a bust for the United States. So we met with Kim Jong Un and he gains some prestige due to this meeting. How does that hurt the U.S? Does it eliminate sanctions or provide economic relief for Korea? Does it mean that other world leaders will come flocking to the Hermit Kingdom bearing gifts of whiskey or frankincense and myrh? We have put a halt on war games. That makes sense. Does anyone think South Korea cannot defend itsel from the North? The North has put all of its dwindling resources into nuclear weapons, their defecting soldiers have worms in them for crying out loud. The North Korean military is going to make the Iraqi Republican Guard look like world beaters. South Korea has a modern powerful military and while the civilian casualties would be enormous there is no doubt they could defend against a conventional attack by North Korea. There is no troubling give away here, it is merely a symbolic pause in our exercises with South Korea. The summit was historic, if denuclearization actually happens it will be worth withdrawing troops that are no longer needed in South Korea.

COMMENTS:
A realistic view of the Singapore Summit is needed, not one tainted by our disdain for either of the main protagonists.
---
The ballistic missile alert in Hawaii was a human error, but it is a sign how much North Korea has achieved its goal. A small country can challenge the super power by mastering nuclear weapon technology. It showed the North Koreans are capable, and no matter how you hate Kim's system, mind control or human rights violations, he can achieve the goals. This leaves the Arab countries in shame - despite their almost endless resources they are not capable of organizing and achieving at the level of the NKs. US can not allow any potential nations to gain inspiration from North Korea, the nuclear program must be stopped right away. This is the weakness of the world powers including US, and the biggest gains President Trump was able to get for national security.

We can draw some comparisons between this summit and Nixon's visit to China. United States did not recognize PRC until 7 years later after the visit. The signatures of heads of state on the document is important but it is only a start. Detailed work still need to be done. If that comparison can be made, we can expect North Korea grow into neither a friend nor a foe to the US, which is a good thing in the grand scheme of things.

Remember the full closure of this denuclearization issue will outlive Trump's presidency. Because of that, the issue is not an internet-age, instant gratification type of process. Let the media have their doubts, and allow Kim time to follow up on his promises. We shall see.
---
I view this entire effort as doomed to failure. Trump can't do it, but nobody else could either. The USA just don't have much leverage over North Korea, so there is no reason for them to give anything up unless something of much greater value is offered in return.

North Korea will not offer irreversible denuclearization. They might offer a "denuclearization" where they hide their weapons and don't test for a while, but that isn't really a concession. The weapons are already serving their purpose though their very existence, and testing will restart whenever it is deemed politically useful.

It's possible that Trump could score an incredibly foolish own goal here, but I think it more likely that this will all end with something not so different from the previous status quo.
---
So you see exactly why this is going nowhere.
---
Nixon visited China to exploit a rift between Communist giants (Sino\-Soviet split), effectively enlisting China as a quasi\-ally against USSR, which arguably turned the tide in the Cold War, and help end the Vietnam war conflict sooner.

Trump visited North Korean leader to essentially avoid a catastrophic escalation that could lead to nuclear war. It was almost like Trump preferred not to be there (he inherited an "Obama/Clinton problem") and basically sucked into President Moon's peace narrative which is too powerful to sweep aside and alienate a key US ally.

Nixon's visit to China was grand strategy and realpolitiks, while Trump's visit to North Korea was to de\-escalate tensions and start a dialogue that is fraught with uncertainty.

TITLE: No deadline for NK Denuclearization?

COMMENTS:
Threats need to be credible. It is very likely the US can and will raise tariffs over the lack of a deal.

For denuclearization there are few threats that will generate concession. Both the US and NK know this, so either the threat is below what would bring NK to denuclearize, or it is drastic enough to not be credible. 

In the former NK can just let the threat be enacted--more sanctions, more troops, whatever--in the latter NK will call the US bluff because it will need to be some kind of an attack. 

Because both sides are aware of this placing a time on concession to a threat is tantamount to already admitting a bluff or already declaring war.
---
We have no leverage with NK.  I mean what exactly would the consequences of not meeting this deadline be, more sanctions? Invasion? Sternly worded letters and tweets?

>I mean, as much as I would like N. Korea to become a better place to live for its people and for the shadow of war to leave the peninsula, is it worth legitimizing a rogue nuclear state?

Yes?

1. Complaining about the morality of non-sanctioned nuclear proliferation when we back Israel is bankrupt. Attempting to convince the world that nuclear weapons are unneeded and that attaining them is a high crime after Libya is bankrupt 

2. We've lost in Korea. We lost the war, we lost the sanction and encirclement, we lost turning their allies against them, we lost the diplomatic jockeying about their nuclear proliferation. We're never going to break this link in China's chain, a small prize anyhow for the damage that's been caused for it. It's time to drink from the bitter chalice and back up.

3. To respect North Koreas sovereignty and to allow for a peaceful solution that may not be to America's immediate advantage would do more to calm the fears of rogue state than any hard line, direct attack on NK's nuclear program

POST: I don't want to sound pessimistic but what happened to the previous agreements to denuclearize? 
https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/04/world/asia/04diplo.html

COMMENTS:
> The DPRK committed to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs and returning, at an early date, to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to IAEA safeguards.

That's from the [joint statement after the Fourth Round of the Six-Party Talks in Beijing, September 19, 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20070313233046/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2005/53490.htm).

In 2006, they performed [a nuclear test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_North_Korean_nuclear_test).

> The DPRK side reiterated that it will earnestly implement its commitments to a complete declaration of all nuclear programs and disablement of all existing nuclear facilities.

That's from the [joint press statement after the Sixth Round of the Six-Party Talks in Beijing, 20 July 2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20171001092443/http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/223847.html).

In 2009, they performed [another nuclear test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_North_Korean_nuclear_test).

And those are by no means the only examples.

So yes, they have agreed to denuclearize before, and anyone with even the slightest shred of historical knowledge will be extremely skeptical of the latest agreement.
---
Not in 2007, but back in the 90’s an agreement was reached that NK would stop development of reactors capable of producing plutonium and the US would supply fuel oil to tide them over until (safe) light water reactors could be built.  Also, there’d be a peace treaty and the trade sanctions would be dropped.   NK shutdown construction, but then the US backed out of its side of the agreement due to Congress blocking the oil and refusing to drop sanctions.
---
Us/ROK joint drills have been suspended indefinitely. Of course, that move is trivial to reverse if the DPRK doesn’t reciprocate with its own concessions, so I still don’t see what u/kolvindr is getting at.
---
Granting Kim legitimacy and getting the US to treat North Korea as an equal is no small concession.

It's been a policy goal of North Korean leaders for decades.

TITLE: Why the hell would NK ever denuclearize? (South Korean)

POST: As I South Korean, I've seen peace talks and 'reunification' hypes ever since the Kim and Roh presidency as well as the recently opened ones. Koreans (regardless north and south) are taught that reunification is their priority since they were young but thoughts are changing nowadays due to realistic approach on economic impact and the burden that South Koreans have to take.


North Korea being the hermit kingdom, where Kim's word is basically the party's voice a.k.a the 'law', how would an economic incentive really fuel the decision markers of the North to throw away their Nukes.

I'm pretty sure Kim has seen what happened to Kaddafi  when he threw away his nukes. They did get sanctions lifted and aid given and their economy did improve greatly in the short years after. And after that... well... you all know.

Also, as much as it is a dictatorship, the country can't just abandon their 'one great goal' of developing nukes with all the stuff they told their people of how it will stop the 'imperial Americans' from invading them. (Although I guess it is effective) It would make Kim look foolish when he demanded sacrifice for everything else just for developing Nukes

My guess is that, if this talk is really one for "reunification" and not one for just another bs peace talk, 
demilitarization can be only agreed when South Korea decides to abandon or lower US influence and it's troops (North has asked for troops to be removed numerous times prior to the summit). Which leads for China to be more open about the whole "unification idea" since US is out of it's immediate presence. But this wouldn't again make sense since the US has to back out it's line now to Japan, Japan arming themselves up and they would have a shitshow with Taiwan.

In sum, I don't get why the hell NK would denuclearize rather than keeping it's status-quo

COMMENTS:
There is no chance NK denuclearises. Some Americans actually think, after putting economic development in statis for 20 years to finally achieve a nuke and icbm that can sufficiently deter the US, that they would actually give it all up, for.. economic aid. Nothing but American delusion and fantasy.
---
I would also like to add. Nuclear Capabilities and Development is not only to ward off intervene from outside but also to deter any opposition from within North Korea as a scare tactic of the 'one thing' that can stop foreign aggression.
---
I find it strange you make the exceptional claim that the government is in danger if economic reforms dont happen "soon". Yet offer 0 evidence and expect people to believe it. The country went through a literal famine and didnt fall apart, and is currently growing at ~4 to 5%
---
Not sure why you would characterize that as an "American" delusion. The last three administrations and the core of policy makers have never expected the North to disarm, and refused to even meet with them. Sanctions and F off with them. Not really a US problem. Clinton considered a preemtive strike in the nineties under the assumption the North would achieve nuclear capability, and ruled against it because of unacceptable civilian casualties--from conventional ordinance.  
  
That's the deterrent--they didn't suddenly achieve it with nuclear capabilities, and that would not be the deterrent to a US strike now. The problem is the artillery bored into the sides of mountains.  
  
The delusion you speak of is primarily South Korean. Trump is a weathervane who has no idea what's going on but heard this might make him look good, but he has Mattis, Pompeo, and Harry Harris over there. These people know the history of the conflict well and have no such delusions.   
  
Did you miss when Pompeo and Bolton said there would be no aid on offer? Because it sounds like you missed that part.

TITLE: Hawks in White House said to team with media to sabotage North Korea talks

COMMENTS:
**SS:**

38North, a website dedicated to the analysis of North Korea,  says the intelligence about secret North Korean nuclear enrichment sites that was being fed to media sources was coming from figures within the Trump White House who were pushing their own agenda.

The article debunks a series of subsequent reports in the US press before concluding that the reporting of major media on the alleged deception of North Korea dismantling its nuclear sites has been misleading.

Until now I thought that Trump has surrounded himself with people who agree with his handling of foreign issues (excluding James Mattis) and therefore presented a united front regarding this. I believe that if this would derail the peace talks it would give the North Koreans the idea that they are dealing with an actor which wants to actively undermine the regime instead of someone who is willing to negotiate to secure their interests. This would make future talks much less likely.
---
> I believe that if this would derail the peace talks it would give the North Koreans the idea that they are dealing with an actor which wants to actively undermine the regime instead of someone who is willing to negotiate to secure their interests. This would make future talks much less likely.

I feel like they already believe this is true by sole virtue of John Bolton's presence in the administration. His past positions both on arms control (read: regime change) in general and North Korea in particular must make them think that genuine lasting peace is highly unlikely.
---
> Since the June 12 Singapore Summit between US President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the US media has woven a misleading narrative that both past and post-summit North Korean actions indicate an intent to deceive the US about its willingness to denuclearize. The so-called intelligence that formed the basis of these stories was fed to reporters by individuals within the administration pushing their own agenda.

Having a basic understanding of the situation led many of us to question North Korea's intent of actually denuclearizing. They built nukes to protect their regime from hostile powers. They don't want to give them up like Gaddafi did in Libya and have their government overthrown.  They wanted nukes as a deterrent and they have them as well as ICBM's that could theoretically deliver a warhead to the United States; giving away your deterrent is completely illogical. If you put aside everything else the media reported and simply know these underlying concepts it should be obvious why many of us never believed North Korea intended to give up their nukes. This isn't even to mention the countless times they have lied to us in the past.
---
> Those nukes were designed to do one thing; to scare either the US or South Korea into breaking its alliance with the other, and then to scare South Korea into a merger that would leave it open to a slow, gradual North Korean political-takeover.

North Korea is a brutal dictatorship based around a dynastical cult of personality. If North Korea and South Korea ever reunify it absolutely isn't going to be under the banner of the Kim regime. The idea that North Korea whom is a pariah worldwide, nearly completely isolated economically and diplomatically, and who is known for its criminality and how terrible it treats its people could somehow absorb and slowly take over one of the worlds most technologically advanced democracies is ludicrous. Even if South Korea wanted this (and I absolutely don't cede that argument) there is zero reason to believe the United States would ever allow it to happen. 

On the other hand a nuclear armed country has never had their regime overthrown by the United States. I'm going to go with Occam's Razor on this one. I don't know why you are so resistant to the idea that nukes provide deterrence and regime protection when it is a historical truism.
---
I don’t claim any expertise in the topic but South Korea voluntarily merging with the North under any circumstances except 1989 Germany analogies seems absolutely unthinkable. Why would they? It’d be like 1989 if Honecker stayed in power and the Stasi expanded across all of Germany.

TITLE: Backgrounder: North Korea’s Military Capabilities

COMMENTS:
This is one of CFR's periodic backgrounder articles, released now probably because of the upcoming Singapore summit.

It considers DPRK's conventional, nuclear, and cyber capabilities, including delivery systems. It also considers the motivations behind DPRK's military position, though it does not explicitly invoke US behavior as a driver.

Overall this shows improvement in the quality of CFR's backgrounders; this one has links to primary and high-quality secondary sources, as well as images and other features. 'Twas not ever thus. But I was disappointed by the shallowness of the final section (on DPRK's strategic motivations).

Not war. More sanctions that China will continue to help them skirt in light of the ongoing trade conflict. Overall, we go back to the status quo from before the summit.

I do. Even with such hawkish personalities in positions of power, war with a developed nation and a regional power is entirely unfeasible, politically and militarily. I'd be surprised by war with Iran, and absolutely shocked by war with North Korea. Not only are they relatively powerful in their own right, and a nuclear power, China is right beside them and likely to intercede again, and South Korea, our regional ally, is absolutely unwilling to go to war with their northern neighbors, at least publicly. Add to that the fact that the American public is extremely war-weary, and I doubt we'd go to war with them even if Bolton was president and Lindsey Graham our SECDEF.

Well, considering that "denuclearization" is a word that was specifically made up to describe whatever it may turn out is the long term future of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula may turn out to be, the tweet is devoid of meaning outside of dadaist hermeneutics. Therefore I guess something between Trump declaring his undying love for Kim in an uptempo K-pop song and nuclear war is the likely next step. 

However, considering that Trump apparently really likes sanctions, he will probably announce the "toughest ever" sanctions on NK. (NK will be somewhat amused by that, the thing is NKs entire economy assumes that there are almost complete sanctions against NK, so they don't loose anything from additional sanctions.)

US military base is a very sensitivity issue in Japan, and Japan has stated that US military does not have permission to use US bases in Japan as a forward-deployed first-strike asset or unilateral pre-emptive strike asset against NK, because it will put the entirety of Japanese homeland at risk for nuclear retaliation or short-range ballistic missile strike against Japan for hosting first-strike US military assets. The Japanese have stated that purpose of US bases in Japan is solely dedicate for peaceful defense of Japan and support of South Korea, but Japan wants no role for these bases to launch a unilateral pre-emptive strike against NK.

I think you are pessimistic.

A lot of groundwork did go in the build up to the second Iraq war. Groundwork for which the current POTUS has no patience.

And even them, it was just two years after 9/11, with most of public opinion in favor. The situation is pretty different.

TITLE: In private, Trump vents frustration over lack of progress on North Korea

COMMENTS:
**In private, Trump vents frustration over lack of progress on North Korea**

When he emerged from his summit with Kim Jong Un last month, President Trump triumphantly declared that North Korea no longer posed a nuclear threat and that one of the world’s most intractable geopolitical crises had been “largely solved.”

But in the days and weeks since then, U.S. negotiators have faced stiff resistance from a North Korean team practiced in the art of delay and obfuscation.

Diplomats say the North Koreans have canceled follow-up meetings, demanded more money and failed to maintain basic communications, even as the once-isolated regime’s engagements with China and South Korea flourish.

Meanwhile, a missile-engine testing facility that Trump said would be destroyed remains intact, and U.S. intelligence officials say Pyongyang is working to conceal key aspects of its nuclear program.

The lack of immediate progress, though predicted by many analysts, has frustrated the president, who has fumed at his aides in private even as he publicly hails the success of the negotiations.

“Discussions are ongoing and they’re going very well,” Trump told reporters Tuesday.

The accounts of internal administration dynamics come from conversations with a half-dozen White House aides, State Department officials and diplomats, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive ­negotiations.

Officials say Trump has been captivated by the nuclear talks, asking staffers for daily updates on the status of the negotiations. His frustration with the lack of progress has been coupled with irritation about the media coverage of the joint statement he signed on June 12 in Singapore, a document that contains no timeline or specifics on denuclearization but has reduced tensions between the two countries.

“Trump has been hit with a strong dose of reality of North Korea’s negotiating style, which is always hard for Americans to ­understand,” said Duyeon Kim, a Korea expert at the Center for a New American Security.

Trump’s interest in the issue has put a particularly bright spotlight on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has tried to wring concessions from his counterpart, Kim Yong Chol, a former spy chief viewed by the Trump administration as uncompromising and unable to negotiate outside the most explicit directives from Kim Jong Un.

A low point from the perspective of U.S. officials came during Pompeo’s third visit to Pyongyang on July 6 when he pressed North Korean officials for details on their plans to return the remains of U.S. soldiers killed during the Korean War, as they had agreed to do in Singapore. The issue had been discussed in several meetings and was viewed by the United States as an easy way for North Korea to demonstrate its sincerity.

But when Pompeo arrived in Pyongyang, the North Koreans insisted they were still not ready to commit to specific plans, according to diplomats familiar with the discussions.

The delay angered U.S. officials, who were under pressure to ­deliver given Trump’s premature ­announcement on June 20 that North Korea had already “sent back” the remains of 200 soldiers.

The sentiment worsened when Kim Jong Un chose not to meet with Pompeo during his stay as had been expected. Pompeo later denied that a meeting was planned, a claim contradicted by diplomats who said the secretary initially intended to see the North Korean leader.

Unable to secure an agreement on remains during his trip, Pompeo scheduled a meeting between the North Koreans and their Pentagon counterparts to discuss the issue at the demilitarized zone on July 12. The North, however, kept U.S. defense officials waiting for three hours before calling to cancel, the diplomats said. The North Koreans then asked for a future meeting with a higher-ranking military ­official.

“Leaving another U.S. official standing at the altar, waiting forlornly for the North Korean representative to show up adds insult to injury,” said Bruce Klingner, a North Korea scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “Pyongyang has reverted to its heavy-handed negotiating tactics.”

The Trump administration has maintained a strong public show of support for the negotiations, even as North Korea denounced the United States’ “unilateral and gangster-like demand for denuclearization” after Pompeo’s last visit and described the discussions as “cancerous.”

On Wednesday, Trump said he secured a commitment from Russia to “help” with the North Korea issue. “The process is moving along,” he tweeted. “Big benefits and exciting future for North Korea at end of process!”

But late last week in meetings with his aides, Trump bristled about the lack of positive developments in the negotiations. And on Friday at the United Nations, his ambassador, Nikki Haley, accused Russia of blocking efforts to discipline North Korea’s illegal smuggling.

Trump and his senior team “haven’t given up entirely” on the goal of full denuclearization, but they are worried, said one person familiar with the discussions.

Climbing down from earlier soaring rhetoric, Trump told CBS this week that “I’m in no real rush. I mean whatever it takes, it takes,” he said.

That more patient approach stands in contrast to earlier Trump administration demands for North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program within a year.

“Trump is too vested to walk away right now,” said Victor Cha, a North Korea expert who the Trump administration nearly selected to be the next U.S. ambassador to Seoul. “At least until after the midterms.”

U.S. officials lay some of the blame on Kim Yong Chol, who despite being North Korea’s chief negotiator has consistently stonewalled discussions by saying he is not empowered to talk about an array of pertinent issues.

That dynamic drew the ire of U.S. officials in an early July meeting in Panmunjom when he refused to discuss the opening of a reliable communications channel or even specific goals of Pompeo’s then-upcoming trip to Pyongyang, diplomats briefed on the meetings said.

The U.S. officials in the meeting, led by State Department official Sung Kim and the CIA officer Andy Kim, wanted to discuss Pompeo’s visit and make progress on returning the fallen soldiers’ remains. But Kim Yong Chol said he was authorized only to receive a letter Trump had written to Kim Jong Un.

When U.S. officials tried to raise substantive issues, Kim Yong Chol resisted and kept asking for the letter. Unable to make headway, the Americans eventually handed over the letter and ended the meeting after only an hour.

“[Kim] has a reputation for being extremely rude and aggressive,” said Sung-Yoon Lee, a North Korea scholar at Tufts University.

Kim Yong Chol’s negotiating tactics so frustrated U.S. officials that several expressed hope that he would be replaced as top negotiator by Ri Yong Ho, the North’s more agreeable minister of foreign affairs. The swap appeared possible because of the joint statement in Singapore, which explicitly named Pompeo as the top U.S. negotiator but referred to his counterpart only as a “relevant high-level DPRK official.”

“I think there is a debate within North Korea over assigning Kim Yong Chol or Ri Yong Ho as the counterpart,” said Cha, who is also a scholar at Georgetown University. “Ri knows the issues better and can speak perfect English. Kim is a former spy, not a negotiator.”

Ri greeted Pompeo at the airport earlier this month alongside Kim Yong Chol, but the former spy chief spent more time with Pompeo than any other senior North Korean official during the two-day visit, seemingly solidifying his position.

In the absence of progress on denuclearization, the Trump administration is likely to focus on the war remains.

At a meeting in the demilitarized zone on Sunday, the two sides agreed to recommence field operations to search for the remains of some 5,300 Americans still missing from the conflict in North Korea. Pompeo said this week that he believes the first sets would arrive in the United States “in the next couple weeks.”

U.S. officials familiar with the discussions said the North pledged to return 55 sets of remains on July 27, the 65th anniversary of the signing of an armistice that ended the war. But Pentagon officials, who sent transit cases to the demilitarized zone weeks ago, are wary of North Korea’s pledges given its previous cancellations.

One of Pompeo’s key objectives ahead of the Pyongyang meeting was to improve basic communications with the North, which had been spotty and unresponsive through intelligence and diplomatic channels, U.S. officials said. The two sides have established working groups aimed at improving the communication problem, a senior State Department official said.

Many of the president’s top security and intelligence officials have long doubted that North Korea would live up to any of its commitments. But given the lack of options outside of the diplomatic realm, some analysts said a tolerant approach still provides the best outlook.

“I worry that Trump might lose patience with the length and complexities of negotiations that are common when dealing with North Korea, and walk away and revert back to serious considerations of the military option,” said Duyeon Kim, the Korea scholar. “Getting to a nuclear agreement takes a long time, and implementing it will be even harder.”

The greatest irony of this is that Trump trashed the Iran nuclear agreement, which has very strict monitoring and controls, for "not being strict enough",  then he goes and declares North Korea no longer a nuclear threat, because Kim Jeung Un gave him nebulous personal assurances during their I'll conceived summit.

I'm also frustrated that "well, Trump's efforts are better nuclear war"  is becoming the response to his incompetence in international politics. All American administrations since the advent of the A-bomb have avoided nuclear war via competent foriegn policy. Trump's "seat of his pants, gut based foreign policy" represents perhaps the greatest threat to peace since the Soviets decided to test the US response to the Cuban Missle Crisis.
---
Absolutely fantastic commentary! Obviously the Trump administration has placed itself between a rock and a hard place. While it can be tempting to laugh at Trump for foolishly trusting the North Koreans, I think it's important to realise that the current paradigm of peace talks is still a marked improvement coming from threats of total war. Let's hope cool heads prevail on both sides.

SS: Although president Donald Trump publically holds an optimistic stance over North Korean denuclearization talks, in private he is frustrated by the lack of progress.

Even just a few days ago Trump has commented about how he has no timeline for denuclearization.  After the midterm elections Trump may return to his hawkish stance again.
Some experts fear talks of war will happen as they do not see Trump as patient enough to see through these talks.

TITLE: Wait Just a Second, What Deal did Trump Make with Putin on North Korea?

COMMENTS:
There's no indication in that article that he made any sort of substantive deal--he also left the NK summit declaring North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat. His casual proclamations are meaningless.  
  
The only thing Russia can do is to stop helping NK skirt sanctions. Putin would never admit that's what they're doing, but even if he agreed to something more vague, like "assistance in overseeing sanctions" or whatever, there's nothing Trump could offer in return that he isn't *already* trying to get fro Putin. What, "I'll try harder, Boss?"  This article seems like the author is a little light on material this week.

TITLE: Trump and Bolton spurn top-level North Korea planning

COMMENTS:
>**National Security Adviser John Bolton has yet to convene a Cabinet-level meeting to discuss President Donald Trump’s upcoming summit with North Korea next week, a striking break from past practice that suggests the Trump White House is largely improvising its approach to the unprecedented nuclear talks**.

>For decades, top presidential advisers have used a methodical process to hash out national security issues before offering the president a menu of options for key decisions. On an issue like North Korea, that would mean White House Situation Room gatherings of the secretaries of state and defense along with top intelligence officials, the United Nations ambassador, and even the treasury secretary, who oversees economic sanctions.

>**Senior officials from both the Barack Obama and George W. Bush administrations called the absence of a formal interagency process before such a consequential meeting troubling**. Peter Feaver, a former National Security Council (NSC) official in the George W. Bush White House, said his colleagues would likely have held "quite a few" meetings of the so-called Principals Committee of Cabinet-level NSC members in a comparable situation. A former top Obama White House official echoed that point, calling the lack of top-level NSC meetings “shocking.”

>Many Asia experts worry that Trump is, as one former Bush official who worked on Asia policy recently put it to POLITICO, “going to wing this summit.” The concern is shared by Japanese government officials who consider North Korea a threat to their security and worry Trump might cut a superficial deal that does too little to disarm Kim.

"Largely improvising" are *really* not the words I want to hear about the White House's approach to monumental nuclear talks with North Korea. Whether this is due to Bolton and Trump clashing, incompetence on the part of either, or a lack of seriousness about accomplishing something at the talks—the fact that Bolton hasn't called any cabinet level meetings or interagency meetings to discuss this is worrying.
---
>To suggest otherwise is to imply that those thousands of hard-working Americans aren't doing their jobs, and is quite frankly, an obtuse and idiotic claim.

All it takes to stop thousands of peoples work is for a higher up person to say "No we aren't doing that". 

At this point, the people leading the charge as to what the U.S. is going to be proposing during this conference is limited to basically to the oval office. The groundlings will have to follow suit when their plan if revealed, if it ever will. Especially in a neutered State Department.
---
The author is basing that statement on "half a dozen" sources from within the administration as well as international foreign policy experts that are clearly worried enough about the break from norms and the lack of methodical and organizational planning that's taking place to go talk to reporters about it. I think taking the word of multiple sources from the administration saying that they are seeing a shocking lack of communication and collaboration between Trump's inner circle and all the national security experts, cabinet members, and other agencies that typically are always closely involved with events like this is less obtuse and idiotic than claiming that everything must be smooth sailing and there's no way foreign policy leadership could mismanage and misplan things just because *you* can't imagine them doing so. I mean, the article literally lists all the things that the Trump admin are not doing that were standard procedure for planning an event of this magnitude according to members of the last 2 administrations. You should probably reread the rest of the article.
---
Firstly, "formal rules" for the talks wasn't mentioned. We're talking about formalized planning processes.

Secondly, the uncertainty involved with unprecedented talks like this means, if anything, you need to have *more* policy planning and *more* interagency meetings. Not less or none.
---
>Whether this is due to Bolton and Trump clashing, incompetence on the part of either, or a lack of seriousness about accomplishing something at the talks—


I'm sure it's all of these.

TITLE: North Korea slams US denuclearisation demands

COMMENTS:
SS: In a worrying sign that Trump's progress to "normalize" relations with Kim Jong Un may be on the verge of collapse, North Korea lashed out at the US for its "extremely troubling" attitude just hours after it held the latest round of discussions with Mike Pompeo, warning that it its “firm, steadfast” resolve to give up its nuclear programs may falter. 

Article: North Korea has accused the US of making “robber-like” demands in denuclearisation talks, in the
first public sign of serious discord since Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un met in Singapore.

After US secretary of state Mike Pompeo left Pyongyang on Saturday, North Korean state media
said the US had made unilateral demands that breached the spirit of the Singapore summit.

“We expected that the US side would come with productive measures conducive to building trust in
line with the spirit of the North-US summit and we considered providing something that would
correspond to them,” KCNA, the North Korean state-run media agency, said citing a statement
from the foreign ministry.

Mr Pompeo was making his third trip to Pyongyang and first visit since the summit. He described
the talks as very productive. But it was the first time that he did not meet Kim Jong Un during a
visit to Pyongyang, in another sign that the talks had not gone smoothly.

Mr Pompeo said North Korea was still committed to the complete denuclearisation of the
peninsula. But KCNA later criticised the US for pushing for “complete, verifiable, and irreversible
denuclearisation”.

CVID had been US policy until the Singapore summit, but was not included in the joint statement,
sparking criticism at the time that Mr Trump had gone soft on Pyongyang.

Following the Singapore summit, Mr Pompeo described suggestions that Mr Trump had taken a
softer stance by not including the phrase CVID as “ludicrous”. The North Korean statement on
Saturday suggested that the US had behind the scenes been pushing for CVID — something North
Korea resists because of the potential for US weapons inspectors to roam around the country.

“The US just came out with such unilateral and
robber-like denuclearisation demands as CVID,
declaration and verification that go against the spirit
of the North-US summit,” said KCNA, adding that the “shortest path” to denuclearisation would be
to “boldly break away from the failure-ridden methods of the past”.

In one exchange during the visit, Kim Yong Chol, the second most powerful person in North Korea,
who is leading the nuclear talks, referred obliquely to problems, telling Mr Pompeo at the start of
their second day that: “Thinking about those discussions [on day one] you might have not slept
well last night”.”

Mr Pompeo responded that he had slept well, but both men said there were “things” they had to
clarify with their leaders.

In another sign of discord, North Korea demanded
new approaches that included “a phased and
synchronous principle”. The US has previously
insisted that it would not agree to a step-for-step approach that would see North Korea be
rewarded at different points along the path to denuclearisation, and has stressed that economic
sanctions will remain in place until North Korea has completed the denuclearisation process.

The first signs of serious turbulence since Singapore will make it harder for Mr Trump to rebut
critics who say he was hoodwinked by Mr Kim. After returning to the US following the Singapore
meeting, Mr Trump provoked widespread ridicule for declaring that there was “no longer a nuclear
threat” from Pyongyang.

“Either some of us are taking crazy pills and hallucinating about the canyon between US and DPRK
interpretations, or this jig will be up soon one way or another,” tweeted Vipin Narang, a nuclear
expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who said the US would either be “living in
denial about NK nukes or . . . exploding at perceived betrayal and Kim’s ‘duplicity’.”

While the North Korean statement underscored the difficulties reaching a deal after decades of no
relations between the countries, the Associated Press said North Korea had also said it
would “wholly maintain our trust toward President Trump”.
---
This is going as predicted by what seems like a majority of those educated and experienced in state level matters.  Poor SK though, they’re so unsure of our current state, that they are willing to get back in bed with the Kim regime.
---
A little condescending towards South Koreans don’t you think? Why are you so sure you understand NK better than the typical person from SK, and who are these people “educated and experienced in state matters”?
---
I think most people saw this coming based on past talks. However, another way to look at it is that with the timing the Trump/Putin summit is coming up, and this gives them a viable area to work together on. (I've been arguing that the Russians manipulated this from the start.)

TITLE: US Officials Try To Sabotage North Korea Peace Deal

COMMENTS:
>using subservient media to launder their baseless claims that intelligence officials have evidence that North Korea is seeking to hide nuclear stockpiles and avoid decnuclearization.

I'd wondered about this.

On the one hand, it could make sense that the NK's would want to stash parts and materials just in case "things don't work out". Doing so would allow for a much faster restart of their nuclear program in the event of a failed peace deal.

On the other hand...

There are always those parties with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. Un-named intel officials might think they know NK "better than anyone else" and attempt a *de facto* pursuit of their own foreign policy.

A deliberate disinfo campaign would be one part of this pursuit.

This second possibility is quite disturbing. Why? It implies that, when it comes to foreign policy, there's a split between the current administration and at least part of the intelligence community... a split that extends beyond merely having a difference of opinion.

>Journalists have reputations that are built by having reliable sources. They most likely wouldn’t publish it unless it came from trusted sources. 

So your defense is you trust journalists on faith? Surely you remember Judith Miller's reporting in Iraqi WMD right?

>Besides, one of the main rules of journalism is to never reveal your sources.

This is not the issue at all. The issue is giving people anonymity in the first place when you have not even corroborated their story, and you are giving them a shield by allowing them access to your massive audience to push whatever false information they want to carry out their agenda.
---
This second possibility isn't all that new though.

Parts of the 'intelligence community' helped congress undermine Obama's Iran deal, they opposed any cooling of tensions with Russia, they opposed any disengagement from the disaster for US policy that is Syria and in many cases this opposition extended to leveraging the media.
---
Did any of the outlets actually see the evidence or are they just reporting like the Washington Post that they were told of the existence of evidence?

>Leaking classified information is illegal?

This doesn't address why journalists should allow officials to spread uncorroborated rumors.
---
Journalists have reputations that are built by having reliable sources. They most likely wouldn’t publish it unless it came from trusted sources.  

Besides, one of the main rules of journalism is to never reveal your sources. So idk why the complaint is really justified. Journalism can’t work if sources are outed.

TITLE: How does China feel about the US-North Korea detente?

COMMENTS:
From what I can see China is fully supportive of detente in Korea. To get a to a broader evaluation, let's look at the Chinese priorities with regard to the Korean Peninsula. 

1. China first and foremost wants stability. A war, state collapse, a refugee crisis etc. would be most unwelcome to the Chinese. Hence, they are unlikely to encourage adventurism on the side of the DPRK. This takes the form of heightened sanctions implementation in response to provocative actions by the DPRK throughout 2017. With the shift towards diplomacy, it would appear that cross-border activity has picked up again. 

2. South Korea is a key trading partner for China as a market, as a partner for technology and as an Investor. Any conflict that would affect the South Korean economy severely would be felt in China. 

3. China would favour economic development in the DPRK. The DPRK is a resource-rich country and has low wage levels. China's reform era was immensely successful and they see their development strategy as a model that the DPRK could follow in principle. 

4. Detente undermines the publicly stated rationale for the stationing US troops and high-tech surveillance equipment on the Peninsula. It would be a diplomatic win for Beijing if the US had to tacitly admit that it is stationing troops in East Asia to oppose China and not have the fig leaf of the DPRK. 

5. An extension of this is that a US incursion into the DPRK would be an extremely undesirable outcome for the Chinese. To me it is completely unthinkable that Beijing would sit idly by while a hostile army marches with hundreds of thousands of troops toward their border, with the prospect that they may make themselves at home for an indefinite time. The Beijing government sent 1 million troops against a the US back when it had a nuclear arsenal (and the military was pressing for it's use) when Beijing did not. 

6. Ultimately, Beijing also favours denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, but this not the highest priority aim and is mostly incompatible with other aims that are more important to China, mainly stability. 

To summarise, I think Beijing welcomes Korean detente for a variety of reasons.

Hardly, that would be like saying Canada and Mexico will become pro-China and anti US. It doesn’t make sense for them from a strategic standpoint. This is because China represents a huge portion of their trade balance and also there is no guarantee from the US that they will be protected from China. Why would the US protect them when it would take Billions of dollars to upgrade their military infrastructure. Rather, a more realistic scenario would be a balancing where not just these to countries, but a lot of countries will try to balance Chinese and US power against each other to get better deals.

People said the same thing about China right up until they flipped on their Russian allies. Why is the US protecting Eastern Europe the same argument about military cost arises. Stranger things have happened historically speaking  its also more so comparative to Eastern and central Europe's Russia relationship then the US with Canada and Mexico.

TITLE: Nine months later, has the United States gained any benefits from the North Korean nuclear "deal?"

COMMENTS:
1. There is widespread confusion about this - a deal is still being negotiated. There is no deal as of yet. So speaking of benefits is premature, as is the periodic media freak-outs about NK nuclear sites still showing activity (read: sites being maintained). Why would they stop when there is no deal?
2. And yes, there are benefits. NK has stopped testing nukes and making threats, and the American president has stopped threatening nuclear war on Twitter. Kim Jung-eun has even made internal and external declarations of denuclearization (however the NK regime defines it) and economic reforms. These are clear benefits, and America gave up almost nothing for it.

&#x200B;
---
And onto the wider topic at hand: NK.

&#x200B;

There are basically two schools of thought on the country  - the hawk camp that sees the NK regime as an evil aggressor bent on mischief and maybe even conquest ^(1), and the dove camp that sees the regime as reformable given time and engagement. ^(2)

&#x200B;

Truth probably lies somewhere in the middle, but my personal opinion is that the hawk camp has no realistic recommendations. The hawks basically consider all diplomacy with NK as a mistake, unless the regime makes significant concessions from the start whilst giving nothing in return. You can see why this is a problem. **And while there are many people who belong in the hawk camp, few people of any importance seems to actually believe in it** ^(3) \- including the "Mad Dog" James Mattis, former Secretary of Defense, Hong Joon-pyo, arch-conservative who ran for the 2017 South Korean presidential election, and Victor Cha, a hawkish US diplomat who was said to have been passed over for appointment as American ambassador to Seoul because he wouldn't support a possible war. Consequences of a war are too great.

&#x200B;

So if any action is to be taken, it would have to be diplomacy. And Trump is doing that, and so far has gotten somewhere - therefore he should not be mocked.

&#x200B;

=================================================================================

1. Usually, this hawk/dove divide occurs along conservative/liberal lines in America, but with Trump (very unexpectedly) taking the dove side, the battle lines have become blurred. We now have loyal conservatives cheering the NK diplomacy, and liberals who have a sudden, intense interest in NK human rights abuses and a myriad of reasons on why US shouldn't deal with them.
2. On the dove logic - we have to incorporate the Western-educated Kim Jung-eun's possible willingness to open up NK, as opposed to his father's infamous secretiveness, paranoia and attachment to Juche.
3. There are some people who truly believe in the hawk camp. Usually tends to be analysts, Japanese or Americans, and, of course, John Bolton - although he has gone quiet over his hawkish stance after his National Security Advisor appointment. But there are truly no "serious" South Koreans who would prefer war to diplomacy, and the hawk/dove divide basically comes down to that.

As a fellow South Korean, I wholeheartedly agree with your opinion.

I disagree. NK is not stupid and they know that they have to convince not only Trump but the US congress in order to get any peace treaty ratified. They need to denuclearize in order to do that. The problem is, what should be the price? They are trying to extract the highest possible price for what they are "willing" to give. That is what we are negotiating these days. So far, the US has not given anything substantial. No sanctions relief, no proclamation, no treaty whatsoever. NK would be very stupid to disarms first before any tangible compromise. Let's put aside all that nonsense talk about the nature of KJU's regime. We know they are a gangster regime already, but in geopolitical terms, the nature of the regime is irrelevant. Instead, we should try to think in their place. What would you do if you were in his place? Of course, NK will never be a Jeffersonian democracy nor an open society. We don't expect any of that. But if we could make them behave and play by international norms, whatever their domestic politics, then why not? that is diplomacy isn't it?

> By delivering on these two promises, he further consolidates his power up North, which makes any true change on the peninsula harder to achieve.

If you define "change" as Kim relaxing his grip on power and moving towards democracy, you are asking for far too much. You are basically asking for NK Glasnost when they were throwing nuclear tantrums in 2017.

You are not wrong about Kim Jung-eun. But the choice is binary now; strike a deal with Kim that benefits us and him (because he won't agree to it otherwise), or go back to confrontation. NK survived the dark, bleak years of all anti-American powers in the 90s and a great famine. I don't think NK will fall or buckle under a renewed bout of confrontation in this far more benign environment (China, world has more money to go around, etc).

For now, the goal should be to reduce NK's nuclear arsenal to a less threatening level, and coax NK into becoming a developmental dictatorship that has really taken root across the Third World. This will make NK far more predictable & vested in regional security.

TITLE: A follow up to my previous thread in regards to the North Korean situation.

POST: Which is here-
https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/96szci/why_is_it_that_people_think_that_there_will_never/

But,I have several more questions that relate to how there are some things in this whole situation that just bug the ever-living daylights out of me.

First off,we all know that China has an MDT with NK...so my billion-dollar question is **Why is China treated like they're extraneous? As in,if the U.S goes ahead with Military action they would turn a blind eye to it and China would just sit in the corner and sulk,so to speak?**

The media thinks like this,our esteemed "politicians" make this a quite *dangerous* assumption and I even see it here on reddit(especially here on geopolitics!) 

Let's be perfectly honest here,China has:

-An rapidly modernizing,vast military

-More powerful and dangerous nuclear ordnance

So,I don't think we need war with China anytime soon(In a manner of speaking.) 

So,why is it that people seem to think Xi/China won't give a crap,when we would,say cause him to deal with a refugee Armageddon(and his country possibly losing not one but TWO important trading partners to NK retaliation:SK and Japan...and I don't think they'll be too enthused about having U.S troops on their doorstep too.)

-And also,why is South Korea,of all people ALSO being treated like they don't matter? I mean,so yes,we all know that if things go tits up with NK,Seoul is done(so to speak..). However,do we really believe that the South Koreans will just roll over and give up? What do you think the U.S did after 9/11? We lost two buildings and 3,000+ people that day and look what happened to Afghanistan and Iraq...South Korea WILL be out for blood..North Korean blood,that is.(And if NK uses a nuke..then they're finished,full stop.)

Again,why(the media and our politicians,namely Trump and Bolton) treat them like they don't matter I have ZERO idea.

-And also..you guys aren't gonna believe this,but...In a way,If North Korea gives up it's nukes..then what on earth are they supposed to do if,say China sees them as a liability that they no longer need and decides to invade them?
(Crazier things have happened in the world.) With a huge army with museum-piece equipment? China would crush them in days! I mean,why can't we see the bigger picture?:We could use NK as more of a means to contain China(wishful thinking,but still..)

It's Like,we want to have NK give up the very thing that will keep them alive,without giving them even a suggestion on how to defend themselves if China decides to lose their minds and go after them.

And also,IF(maybe,and I hope to god I'm wrong about this,When) a war happens,then Korea in general,Japan(if and when NK decides to throw a nuke their way) and to a lesser extent,China..is it "over" for them,as in they'll be done as economic powers?
I mean,that has been something I threw around a bit back in the day,East asia ending up like Africa(As in the more worse off nations of Africa) and I see it as hyperbole,but...will they be THAT screwed? I mean,are we talking about 30> years of recovery?
Are we gonna be talking about G-6,or something?

I read a lot of dire predictions about a second korean war,And I'm thinking..it won't be good and that is a massive understatement!
I mean,is it me,Or do Just not a lot of people care about a second Korean conflict or what it will do to East asia?
It certainly looks that way:Lindsey Graham's remarks,the views of people that posted on some of mine and other NK-related threads on here and Quora that think that a Second Korean Conflict will just be a overnight affair...

If I was in either Seoul or Tokyo,I wouldn't be sleeping too soundly,that's for sure,but that's just me.


TL;DR:I have NO idea why everyone thinks SK and China are irrelevant(I'm pointing the finger at you Trump and Bolton) And I have NO idea why people think it's worth WWIII to stop NK's nuclear program.
SK and China are two nations that have made it VERY clear (especially and namely China)that they don't want any military conflict...and even if a conflict does happen,what can we do? East Asia will just be well...screwed and that'll be the end of it,no?

Why be scared/concerned over something we can't stop anymore than we can stop a Earthquake or hurricane?

COMMENTS:
>The media thinks like this,our esteemed "politicians" make this a quite dangerous assumption and I even see it here on reddit(especially here on geopolitics!)

James Mattis certainly doesn't think this way. Which is all that matters. And to be frank I don't think the American establishment (including Trump) is unaware of the MDT either. I mean if you and I are aware of this, is it conceivable that they don't know? 

DPRK is hyped up primarily for domestic propaganda. America isn't going to invade DPRK. After all unlike Iraq, DPRK *actually* has WMDs (never mind the MDT with China).
---
To be honest, North Korea is a side-show. The true target is Iran, and it was never about WMDs, or else NK would have been toppled before 2006, and Pakistan (which harbored Osama Bin Laden, sponsors terrorism, and has nuclear weapons) would have been overthrown by US.

​

North Korea is a convenient excuse to justify continued US military presence and weapon sales to SK and Japan, but is not a strategic imperative to end the tensions since NK, SK, Japan does more trade with China than with US, so only thing going for US is it's mafia protection racket to maintain hegemony and influence.

​

>**Why is China treated like they're extraneous?**

China is "irrelevant" because US thinks it can get away with precision missile strikes or airforce strike at select nuclear enrichment facility and nuclear arsenal stockpile without military retailiation by China.\* (they US will likely notify China ahead of time out of deference and respect to China, promise no US troops above 38th paralle, no seek NK regime collapse, no seek regime change, and no seek accelerated reunification of Korean peninsula).

​

There is theory amongst some Chinese analyst that NK's enrichment of nukes and testing nukes is a violation of the spirit of Sino-DPRK 1961 MDT, so therefore, China is not legally obligated to intervene to defend NK because NK is the aggressor state, that provoked foreign attack.

​

Indeed, China is publicly on record for opposing NK's nuclear program. So if a precision strike is limited on NK enrichment sites and nuclear missile facilities, it would follow in China's best interest since it's targeting NK's nuclear weapons, which China opposes.

​

To add more weight, White House by way of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is publicly on record on declaring the Four No's: "US does not seek accelerated reunification, no toppling of NK regime, no regime collapse, and No US Troops above the 38th parallel"

​

**Things get more complicated if it involves Regime Change.** This is where MDT really matters.

​

China is publicly on record on say that is US attempted for regime change/toppled regime (going above and beyound merely targeting nuclear enrichment and nuclear missile stockpile), then China would definitely intervene and prevent it from toppling NK regime and setting US troops on China's border.

​

>**As in,if the U.S goes ahead with Military action they would turn a blind eye to it and China would just sit in the corner and sulk,so to speak?**

​

Let's be more clear, what is Military Action?  Is it option 1 or option 2?

​

1. Is military action defined as precision missile strike and airstrikes against only nuclear enrichment targets, nuclear missile stockpile? (accompanied by US promise to China to not send troops above 38th parallel, any troops above 38th paralell will immediately withdraw below 38th parallel after denuclearization mission is done, no seeking regime change or regime collapse or reunification under SK rule)

​

Result: Then China will likley sit out.

​

OR

​

2) US launches a full-scale ground invasion of NK with the intent on regime change and accelerated reunification of Korea under Seoul-rule, with US troops on permanent settlement north of 38th parallel near China's border?

​

Result: China will not stand idly by and will send troops to intervene under MDT treaty.

​

​The honest assessment is that a precision air-strike is likely not able to eliminate all NK nukes (only a full-scale ground invasion and occupation of NK can guarantee all nukes accounted for and destroyed). So a limited strike is highly risky given a limited strike can spiral into a full-blown war, and given close proximity of Seoul and Tokyo to ballistic missile retailiation, it's lots of casualties. South Korea is adamantly against a pre-emptive first strike, so US risks alienating it's East Asian ally in the process of a highly risky attack that will likely not work, and reinforce NK's siege mentality, and give reason for China to re-introduce troops again into NK.

​

South Korea is having a large media campaign about embracing North Korea and letting the past be the past. According to polls even the South want reunification.

Next decade? No, China still has a decade left of +5% GDP growth according to IMF and WB. 

&#x200B;

China will only initiate conflict against Taiwan when it's fully industrialized, developed, and globalized. Even then, it will wait for an opportune time when US is quagmired in another global crisis in Middle East or Eastern Europe, and too distract to respond.

>I mean,so yes,we all know that if things go tits up with NK,Seoul is done(so to speak..)

​

I hear this a lot, specifically related to the munitions NK could dump on Seoul in a short period of time.

Just thought I'd throw the following information out there:

**Northrop Grumman developed laser defense systems that provide "defense against short-range ballistic missiles, short- and long-range rockets, artillery shells, mortars" by "generating a protective shield of about 10 kilometers in diameter".**

Basically the laser could shoot down everything NK fires at Seoul, short of ICBMS. But this was also from 2006, so I imagine the technology has matured quite a bit since then.

TITLE: IAEA: No indication that North Korean Nuclear Activities Have Stopped

COMMENTS:
I am genuinely curious to hear the reasoning as to why they would ever denuclearize at this point. 

1. North Korea is wedged between two great powers with an interest in controlling the peninsula or at least maintaining a balance of power. 
2. Nuclear weapons are the surest means of a nation's national security from outside forces.
3. North Korea can leverage these two points above in order to have a better position from which to engage China and the United States.
4. Additionally, now that nonproliferation efforts have (once again) failed, it seems likely that the international community will slowly normalize relations with Pyongyang. 
5. As it pertains to the two Koreas, it seems that a soft wedge has been placed between Seoul and Washington which places Pyongyang in a unique position to appeal to the nationalists in South Korea and nudge the two nations closer together--ostensibly under leadership from the North.
6. Iraq, Libya, and Ukraine demonstrate clearly to North Korea that nuclear weapons are a sufficient deterrent from outside military action, particularly regime change and territorial acquisition, and that great powers are drawn to easy targets.
7. Unlike South Africa, the only nation to independently develop nuclear weapons and later disarm, North Korea is in a very pivotal position geopolitically.  Disarmament could prove disastrous in future conflict and it would almost certainly mean subservience to one of the great powers in the region, likely China. 

If North Korea values geopolitical independence, one of the greatest tools to that end is its nuclear deterrent.  If North Korea values a dominant position on the Korean peninsula, it cannot be assured without nuclear weapons (that isn't to say it does assure it, just that it is a necessary condition for such assurance). I've heard people, especially on forums like this, argue that nuclear weapons serve as a bargaining chip whereby FDI and an easing of sanctions will be met with disarmament; but such a strategy is a bit idealistic and assumes certain personality traits of Kim that we simply do not know. 

Now I will say at the outset that of the seven points I mentioned, the fifth is the weakest and has the least evidence supporting it. I would appreciate any additional insight into the dynamic at play there, or whether it exists at all. My understanding of *Korean* nationalism is that it is a phenomenon based around the notion of a single, unified Korea as opposed to *North* or *South* Korean nationalism. Anyway, I hope to get some feedback on these points. Have a good one y'all.
---
The odds of a US military strike dropped significantly as North Korea acquired its nuclear deterrent though. Trump seemed to have rehashed Eisenhower’s old massive retaliation rhetoric but, like Eisenhower, soon realized how such a strategy lacks credibility. North Korea’s nuclear weapons have diminished the risk of a kinetic conflict with the United States, not raised them. If North Korea were still developing the capability to possess nuclear weapons (like in the run up to the 2006 or 2009 tests) and Trump were president, then the risk of conflict would be significantly higher. Fire and fury was no longer credible after NK had actually acquired its deterrent capability.
---
Precisely, no matter how much the media would want to push the narrative that a de-nuclearised NK would result in a peaceful way to deal with the regime, it's not a reality. North Korea also has no incentive to destroy their nuclear arsenal since by doing that they'll be opening the door for a potential military invasion by foreign powers. If anything, the entire spectacle of NK and SK leaders meeting and crossing the border was nothing but talk, as unfortunate as it may be. They're too different ideology wise to ever reach an understanding.

TITLE: Trying to Understand the North Korean Situation..

POST: Even though things have reached a stabilization point(for the time being,anyway),There are still some things that I still don't really get about the North Korean situation...And I'm hoping folks here can help me understand some things here..Or at least point me in the right direction where I can get some understanding of this whole situation.

**WARNING:Some of these questions may be stupid questions/hyperbolic,so I apologize in advance,but there is a LOT of crazy stuff being said about NK and their nukes...**

(Main questions are bolded)

So with that said,here's my heap of questions:

1-Given that NO ONE(and I mean NO ONE...I see that on this very subbreddit too) trusts NK or their intentions,Is war is the only way to stop NK's Nuclear program? is risking WWIII with China(and possibly Russia) and sending the world into a new dark age(Japan eating a third nuke,Seoul being brutalized by NK arty AND nukes? Hello global depression that makes 1929 look like a drop in the bucket!) the only way to end NK's nuclear ambitions once and for all?

**The media,our politicians(Namely lindsey Graham) and many people seem to think so. So what are we really gonna be looking at?**

2-Lindsey Graham..what on god's green earth is wrong with this guy? I mean,every single time he's spoken about NK...he's even more of a NK hawk than Bolton and Pompeo could ever be! I mean,does this guy have an special hatred of Korea/Koreans in general? it seems like this guy doesn't mind if the Korean peninsula ends up a wasteland for the rest of humanity's existence! I mean,he seems to want war with NK more than even trump himself!

**So,what is Graham's angle? He's said nothing about Iran,yet he seems to want to see the Korean peninsula turned into a hole in the ground that badly? What's with this guy? I well and truly don't understand this man at all..**

3-The capabilities of North Korea in general...are we really that hopeless and helpless to stop NK before Seoul gets turned into a killing field? Are our missile defense systems really that useless to the point that we may even see a nuclear mushroom over say,Los Angeles and/or San Francisco? Things are making it seem that NK holds all the cards and we can't really do anything about them.(Again,the words of the media,politicians and other folks elsewhere on the internet,not necessarily mine.)

**Are we really that screwed against NK and their missiles?**

4-The massive disconnect between public opinion and the Media/experts/politicians..Why is it that(namely) South Koreans think that war will never happen with NK in any lifetime? I mean,you have experts,politicians,the media all saying war could happen with varying possibilities/probabilities(And can still happen,especially if Trump feels like Mueller is gonna have him dead to rights..)..and yet there are those in SK who think war won't happen..at all.

If Trump decides to go berserk on NK,who's gonna stop him? China?Russia? the U.N? South Korea(lol)? Congress (lmao)?
No wonder they say that millions could die..it seems like SK will never see it coming when NK goes berserk themselves.
(And Japan is just as screwed..I mean,if our BMD systems are really that useless,then god help Japan,is all that I'll say.)

**So,why is it that people are that naive?**

5-Why is North Korea so oversold and feared,when you have...**Russia**,who has:

-Actively interfered with U.S elections

-Has far more dangerous nuclear weapons and far more reliable means of delivering them

-Has actually done more concerning(in a manner of speaking) things(invading sovereign nations,involved in the downing of a airliner,killing people on foreign soil,etc.) 


**And yet,we have to be scared of North Korea..why?**



TL;DR:
Again,I'm sorry if my questions are stupid and/or hyperbolic,but this situation scares me in a way(though not as much as a couple months back),and all I have is just question after question and there are some(if not a lot) of things that just don't add up.
I believe that to no longer be afraid of something,you must understand how it works,IMO.

So,I hope you guys don't attack me too much....

P.S:Anyone wonder why we have to be scared of things we can't control,like nuclear war?
why does the media/our politicians always have to do that to us? I mean,what do they want us regular citizens to do?

COMMENTS:
Okay so I'm in no way an expert but I've been to South Korea several times (technically also North Korea once, but only like 3m), had lenghty talks with lots of Koreans about the matter and I have formed somewhat of an assessment about the situation.

There is no chance that a war between North Korea (+ allies) and USA (+allies) will happen.

Western media tend to depict Kim Jong Un as a maniac who wants nothing more than to destroy the USA and basically the entire Western world, which is very much not the case. He has one goal and one goal only: To stay in his position of power, keep the tight grip on his people and eventually die wealthy and of old age.

The best way for him to reach this goal is not to break the status quo that has existed for the past 60+ years. A nuclear arsenal is North Korea's life insurance, their way of keeping any kind of foreign intervention at bay. He has seen what happens to dictators who don't have that capability (Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi). Kim Jong Un and everyone around him in the North Korean power circle are very well aware of their military inferiority to the USA and their allies. In a fictional scenario of a war they would probably wreck havoc upon Seoul (maybe also Tokyo which is less likely, I don't think their defense systems are that useless) and indeed kill hundreds of thousands of people before the combined forces of USA, Japan and South Korea raze the entire country to the ground within weeks. North Korea may have millions of fighting men and women, but they don't stand a chance against the superior weapon tech and (probably) tactics of the US + allies. Oh and also the thousands of nukes that US have.

The situation along the border is definitely tense. There's no reason to doubt that the North Korean army has thousands of conventional weapons directed at Seoul (which is a 1-hour drive away from the border and houses 25 million people). I have visited the border and Panmunjom, the place where Kim and South Korean president Moon have recently met. There is incredible tension to be felt, the whole border area is packed with South Korean and US military presence (28,000 US soldiers are stationed in the country, most of them near the border. The South Korean military is some 500 - 600,000 strong and naturally a lot of them are also stationed there). I've spoken to some US soldiers who guided us tourists along the border and they basically said that they operate at a constant state of being alert.

Still, no one there *really* believes that they will have to fight North Koreans at some point of time. For the reason I've stated above.

So, there will be no agression from the North Korean side. I also do not think that there will be actual aggression carried out by the USA beyond tweets. Why? Because they have nothing to gain there. US military strategists know just as well that North Korea won't trigger said war and they won't unnecessarily endanger US troops, territory or allies in any way. Trump will ultimately listen to *literally everyone around him* telling him exactly that.

Currently they are in a strong position in East Asia and have lots of influence there. The North Korean threat legitimizes the presence of some 50,000 troops in South Korea and Japan, along with the positioning of the THAAD system which allows US intelligence to monitor a huge chunk of Chinese territory. South Korea is an economically important ally to the Western world and it's best to keep it that way. If the US recklessly started a war with North Korea and provoked the destruction of Seoul, the whole world would condemn the US for that.

>risking WWIII with China(and possibly Russia)

Neither China nor Russia will lift a finger if it actually was happening. Yes, China wants to avoid sharing a border with a unified, capitalist Korea sprinkled with US troops, so they are doing their best to keep the status quo as it is.

Still, never in a thousand years will China start World War III over the insignificant little North Korea. Too much risk with too little to gain. It's all about business and even if Xi Jinping and Donald Trump are currently diving into an all out trade war, they still need each other economically. A war between these two and the immediate stop of imports and exports would permanently cripple most big companies on both sides of the Pacific. Not only that, the complete global enocomy would crash. Neither will Russia risk ruining their already crippled economy with a war over North Korea. It's politically and economically senseless.

So what will happen? Unification? Also probably not.

Both North and South Korea have recently said they desire unification. The thing is, both Koreas would only agree to reunification on their terms. The Kim regime will never accept a westernized Korea with Seoul as its capital, Moon as its president, US troops scattered across the country, capitalist mindset and way of living and the US looming over the country. The other way around it's even more implausible.

I'm not even starting on how expensive and extensive a reunification would be. Think of the German reunification and take it tenfold. There is still a distinct slope in education, income and living standards between former West- and East-Germany after 30 years. The difference between the Germanys wasn't even remotely as grave as the difference between the Koreas is now.

So there are two possiblities of North Koreas future.

A) Everything will stay as it is, Kim will surpass the next several US presidents, there will be some troubleshooting here and there with nothing actually happening, he will die in a few decades and his successor will keep on doing his thing. Maybe someday there won't be any aggression any more, both Koreas will exist peacefully next to each other, maybe the North will even be a little less isolated.

B) The country will internally crash in some way, either because of a civil uprising or an internal power struggle. Who knows.

I hope I shed some light upon the matter for you.

PS: Don't know about that Graham guy, sorry.

> Neither China nor Russia will lift a finger if it actually was happening. Yes, China wants to avoid sharing a border with a unified, capitalist Korea sprinkled with US troops, so they are doing their best to keep the status quo as it is.

Depends who starts it.

If the US was the first to initiate provocations and launched a full-scale ground invasion of North Korea, then China has stated publicly on record that it will intervene to prevent this.

On the other hand, if NK was the first to intiative provocations and launched a full-sclae invasion of South Korea, then China has stated publicly on record that it will NOT support NK, and will stay neutral.

Essentially, China will side against whichever side initiates war.

>  Still, never in a thousand years will China start World War III over the insignificant little North Korea.

Cursory look at the Korean war disproves this theory.

> Too much risk with too little to gain.

Depends who starts is.

If US initiates an invasion of NK, China would most definitely intervene just as it did in the Korean war. On the other hand, if NK initiates an invasion of SK, then China would not side with NK, and likely invade NK from the rear to establish a puppet state.

> It's all about business and even if Xi Jinping and Donald Trump are currently diving into an all out trade war, they still need each other economically.

Again, it depends who starts it.

China is legally obligated by the 1960 Sino-DPRK Mutual Defense Treaty to defend North Korea from an external attack by all means neccessary.

Why would China's word on 1960 China-NK MDT have any less weight than 1955 US-ROK MDT or 1950 US-JPN MDT?

>A war between these two and the immediate stop of imports and exports would permanently cripple most big companies on both sides of the Pacific. Not only that, the complete global enocomy would crash. Neither will Russia risk ruining their already crippled economy with a war over North Korea. It's politically and economically senseless.

This is the precise reason why US does not attack NK over it's WMDs.

How can someone be so smart, but so dead wrong about China's economy in other posts?

Good post. But I also like to comment that Pentagon wargames estimated it will take 56 days to completely occupy NK in the event of NK collapse.  So even if US achieves air superiority, it will take 56 days max. It will likely take double that amount (+100 days) against a unified strong NK, which is reasonable since NK has stockpiled enough oil/gas/rations for 100 days of full-scale war, sufficient enough time for the PLA Northeastern Theatre to mass mobolize across the Yalu river.

Pretty thorough summary there. I think your prediction is spot on. Continuation of the status quo is the most probable or some internal collapse because of a coup or some other internal development. We’ve kind of being waiting for that outcome with Cuba and NK and it never seems to materialize, but one day things may just fall apart and it may just be a whimper and not a bang, something no one really anticipated. 

Graham is very much a hawkish interventionist in the vain of McCain/Pompeo/Bolton. Bolton’s probably a notch above the rest. Always sees a military solution. You’re probably just not aware but Graham’s the same way towards Iran. Trust me there’s no inconsistency there. Google some of his comments on them. Bolton and Pompeo tiptoe around Russia because of Trump. 

Previous US admins have sought to isolate and alienate the North Korean regime through multilateral sanctions. Trump did a good job with the maximum pressure campaign while NK was provocatively launching missiles all over the place. But his stated goal was NK’s disarmament, which no one thought was realistic and its proven not to be. So he’s gotten a lot of credit for de-escalating tensions that he was at least partially responsible for ratcheting up (fire and fury). But we’re not on some kind if new course with them. But it’d be bad optics for Trump to admit he was snookered by NK. He’ll tout the release of the remains and they’ll keep plugging away on their nuclear weapons program.

US is in a pickle, with both China and SK adamantly against war on Korean peninsula.

Risking potential WW3 with China, against the wishes of it's strongest ally in the region (SK) is not a smart geopolitical move.

So Trump, sensing this, will likely play along with NK "denuclearization" with illusion of results, secure a Peace treaty, which allows US to set up an honorable exit from Korean peninsula so the Koreans can choose their own future. Trump is on public record stating he wants long term withdrawal of US troops from Korea to save the costs (Translation: Peace with Honor)

SK will see to it NK's economy improves so NK doesn't collapse and overrun SK with burden of immediate unification; set up future possible soft-unification as NK independently grows more modernized.

TITLE: North Korean propaganda changes its tune

COMMENTS:
Submission statement: This article from the BBC addresses recent changes in North Korea's internal propaganda efforts after the recent Singapore summit. The article notes that there is a steady drop in anti-U.S. messaging from the North Korean government, with a shift to a focus on internal economic reform and a more muted tone on issues concerning the U.S. However, the article also allows that North Korea might eventually see a change in its internal political messaging if relations between North Korea and the U.S. are to change or tensions to more visibly reappear. One aspect that this article does not account for is whether or not appropriate trust verification measures have been taken by the U.S. with North Korea or vice versa, or whether the nuclear or cyber weapons programs in North Korea (or hostile rhetoric against South Korea) will continue to pose a challenge, and how this might shape future messaging.

The article also quotes a tour guide talking about what he has seen, which is carefully limited and curated for outside consumption. Something like revising textbooks would be noteworthy, but it would still take generations to reverse the weight of seven decades of indoctrination. Posters are cheap--in every sense.  
  
The North has a history of alternating between belligerence (and outright acts of war) and charm offensives. It's far too early to draw any conclusions from this--they have yet to make any substantive concessions, nor even make a formal and verified declaration of their capabilities nor commit to how they are defining "denuclearizing the peninsula".  
  
Moreover, changing emphasis from the anti-US posture to economic development in no way necessarily includes their giving up the nuclear program nor the enormous amount of conventional ordinance they are using to hold Seoul hostage. They would of course prefer to keep their weapons and prosper anyway if they can--who wouldn't?

Have you read many classic books on politics? Kingships are far more rare these days but they still apply. Transfer and consolidation of power in these forms of government aren’t pretty. It often is very dirty and requires a lot of sacrificing of virtue for vice to establish your recognized authority. Sending messages, ousting political foes, giving agency to different power groups like generals and military officials, all are complicated webs that need to be handled. For instance when you’re a new leader, you have multiple factions to appease, and when you aren’t immediately granted mandate, you have many micro factions who want your seat on the throne. Sometimes sending a message in the most savage way is the most effective way of securing your seat. 

Keep in mind he was handed down his crown. So he’s not very likely to be a power crazed sociopath, but those who climb the ranks and vie for those positions from the outside are most certainly are, so you have to communicate and handle them with extremely heavy hands. Like I said, it can be very brutal and messy, but unfortunately necessity. Kingships aren’t like democracies with smooth transitions of power.
---
Reformation doesn’t happen over night with the wave of a hand. Its not like the movies. Multiple factions are in need of being managed and appeased. Things are also slow to change. Cultural norms, policy, institutions, and so on, all take time to change. All the while consolidating power and fending off coups.

TITLE: North Koreans discontent over abandonment of nuclear weapons

COMMENTS:
If this is opinion/view is widespread/popular/majority then arguments told to their leadership such as for example in non censored form "Give up your nuclear weapons and we will stop violating human rights of your people by right of work and economic development which we sabotage with hypocritical sanctions that have plethora of double standards...".

This kind of defeats argument/criticism against the regime about nuclear and missile program, their people may have not been acceptable of it at first after outside information started pouring in yet ag present they now seem to see the benefits/margins from and that in form of credible detterence against world superpower.

The mentality is likely, what happened in past doesnt matter much when present and future where its at and abandonment of this would be wasteful after completion/mature state of it even if it was considered by them as wasteful in past.

It would be ironic if Kim Jong Un gets deposed not because of the system he inherited that has flawed unfair rule, but because of nuclear disarmarment to get potentialy executed and the people exclaiming fuck you to the world. You want to disarm us? Come at us.

So will democratic countries go against the will of North Korean people if such happens?

TITLE: Top US commander in Korea: Material needed for North Korea to make nuclear bombs is still intact

COMMENTS:
Israel has never tested a single nuclear weapon. Anyone with a brain knows they possess fully working nukes.

Pakistan tested once, two decades ago. Still possess nuclear weapons.

The testing is done to validate design and build process. Once you have a successful test, you don’t need further testing on the same design. 

North Korea not conducting further tests doesn’t mean shit, it’s not the important part. They possess working design that’s all that matters as far as testing goes.
---
> Israel has never tested a single nuclear weapon.

I thought that Israel was responsible for, or at least involved with (they worked with South Africa during the apartheid), the [Vela Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vela_Incident), which was an illegal nuclear weapons test. Also according to some sources, this would not have been their first nuclear weapon test.
---
Buy mah commemorative coin!
---
Don't see a reason why they should destroy that material before they have a deal. Even if they do get a deal we all know the current US government can't be trusted so...there's that.
---
Strictly speaking, we don't *know* what the fuck happened during the Vela incident. The nuclear angle is most likely, though, and its likely South Africa was involved. 

Interesting little mystery, though. I look forward to the inevitable Doctor Who episode.

COMMENTS:

While that's been always assumed, I think it's not a total failure of foreign policy because the North Koreans are talking to the South. 

He may remain a dictator but if the goal is to find ways to improve the livelihood of North Korean citizens, abandoning any further talk cause they still have nukes seems premature.
---
I think the real takeaway from this article is this:

> The new US report highlights a growing threat from China and Russia, which are "more aligned than at any point since the mid-1950s".

A potential Chinese-Russian alliance has been the primary threat to American global hegemony for a while but the CIA Schlieffen plan of the last decade to first isolate and derange Russia and then take on China alone before it gets too strong with ground bases in Afghanistan and North Korea seems not feasible anymore. China's economy has been growing too fast and a substantial unrest in Russia that could be turned into regime change seems rather unlikely despite all the efforts to inflame one although the efforts to vilify Russia have been at least partially successful. Also the window to render a attack on North Korea as a peace mission and get international support for it has closed and the attempts to cultivate the public opinion against North Korea by relentlessly launching new stories to ridicule Kim or to highlight the unbearable circumstances in the country have stopped several months ago. And having Trump as a president was a major obstacle to the plan as well because he is the wrong kind of corrupt and would not be reliable enough for a mission of that scale and the South Korean peace efforts have not been helpful either.

The entire GOP will just accept it and that's the only people he cares about so what's the hold up?  At best Paul Ryan will Tweet "Well I'm not sure about that," or something before he's forced to delete it.

Why accept these failures when you can just lie and tell those dumbfucks anything you want?

I don't understand why Republicans popped the champagne corks just because they had the summit in the first place.

Kim (and his father) have been trying to meet with every single US President since Reagan; this could have happened under *any* of them. Trump was just the first to say yes.

if it ever comes to anything, that would be amazing, but until an agreement is actually reached and fulfilled, North Korea gets way more out of appearing on stage with the American President than we do.
---
Well, kim said to Trump  "if u want me to denuclearise,you go first"

Can you blame him?
---
Trump also claimed in the press conference that Kim Jong-Un didn’t know about Otto Warmbier being tortured and killed. Love to hear Warmbier’s family reaction to that. 

If Trump truly believes that, he’s a bigger idiot than I thought.

COMMENTS:
South Korea's national security adviser says that Kim Jong-un wouldn't insist on U.S. troop withdrawals if an an end-of-war declaration was signed.

I suspect that he is just being a diplomat and trying to prevent discussions from falling apart.

In theory it would be a part of a defense agreement between the US and SK. But then if the US just decides "Nah we're leaving kthx" SK wouldn't really be able to force them to stay.

So we are right back where we started? Unless I missed something, it feels just like it did before the historic meeting between the two. The sanctions were put in place because of the nuclear program, and we told NK that they will remain until they denuclearize. Now, after that “landmark” meeting, that supposedly changed the relationship between the two countries, our latest statement is “we will keep the sanctions until you denuclearize”. I am not the smartest man and I want to believe that I missed something, but I don’t think that is the case. It’s almost like we are getting run around in a circle.
---
We never left. This whole thing has been a slow process of getting North Korea to a serious negotiating phase and understanding the breadth of what that requires. All of these gestures of good will are accompanied by a lot of behind-closed-doors negotiations with the real negotiators. Each PR thing we see is both sides agreeing to continue those negotiations. 

So far neither side has given up anything. The North Koreans gave up some prisoners and have dismantled their probably destroyed test site and the US has simply halted war games as kind of a gesture of good will to keep the negotiations coming. Both of these are pretty insignificant in the grand scheme of things (war games are easily restarted, nuclear testing sights are rebuilt)

North Korea could have hid the fact that their test site was destroyed, so it's a pretty big step for them to be taking to basically publicly admitting they are done doing nuclear testing at their facilities right now and are dismantling them in full view of the public.

So now there's going to be more rounds of negotiations between the real negotiators. KJU and Trump and even Moon Jae-in were never going to be the ones sitting at the negotiating table. They were the ones moving the pieces into place for the real policy makers to have long, difficult discussions. The leaders will continue to guide their negotiators of course, but that's about it.

We're a long way from North Korea really giving up their nukes, but they've taken a lot of steps in the past 6 months that's gone above and beyond anything they've done in the past. It's a good sign they are willing to work with South Korea and the US as the increased sanctions and general reluctance of the US to give in to any of NKs usual bullshit are probably starting to really hurt them. 

It seems that for the first time in decades there's an actual peaceful path to denuclearization. It would be really stupid to squander this opportunity, which is why I'm so frustrated at the amount of people so vocally expressing their desire for Trump to fail. We may not get another shot at this. Put your partisan or idealistic bullshit behind you. There's tens of millions of lives at stake here. 

At the absolute very least we go back to the status quo.

While this is moving in the right direction for relations with NK and the world, everyone needs to realize that NK has repeatedly agreed to denuclearize before and has failed to actually follow through. So while some people just hate Trump, many realize that the summit accomplished nothing besides showing we accept the NK government as legitimate (which is one of the reasons we have refused to meet with them before). NK is moving in a good way to potentially denuclearize, however we don't know if they are actually going to do it, and as of right now, there is no proof there are actually moving towards that goal, besides dismantling one missile test site. In addition, Trump has given up joint military exercises (and seemingly, nobody knew that was coming until he said it)for no real gain, other than Kim now being able to say he made the aggressive Americans back off, further consolidating his power.

Until there is actually a signed agreement and checks on if they are actually following through, we should keep our enthusiasm in check and take whatever Kim says with a grain of salt

While this is moving in the right direction for relations with NK and the world, everyone needs to realize that NK has repeatedly agreed to denuclearize before and has failed to actually follow through. So while some people just hate Trump, many realize that the summit accomplished nothing besides showing we accept the NK government as legitimate (which is one of the reasons we have refused to meet with them before). NK is moving in a good way to potentially denuclearize, however we don't know if they are actually going to do it, and as of right now, there is no proof there are actually moving towards that goal, besides dismantling one missile test site. In addition, Trump has given up joint military exercises (and seemingly, nobody knew that was coming until he said it)for no real gain, other than Kim now being able to say he made the aggressive Americans back off, further consolidating his power.

COMMENTS:
No, not really. It offers North Korea's leaders a way out without facing international criminal courts, it feeds the people, and it relieves the burden to South Korea. It antagonizes the situation with China, but someone needs to stand up to China. It's too perfect of a scenario to play out.
---
Your are correct it is but China would never let it happen.

TLDR; 
Trump claims of            
a) North Korea not being a threat.         
b) The Islamic State being defeated and not a threat.          
c) that the US mexico border is a security threat, and not just a regular threat but bad enough to warrant declaring a national state of emergency.             
d) That Iran is violating the Nuclear agreement.                 

Are all lies and not supported and/or directly contradicted by the US's own intelligence agencies.           
Pathetically enough, you don't even need the intelligence services to know all those claims were bullshit.             
This info is easily available on news websites, it's not a secret.

>Directly contradicting President Donald Trump, U.S. intelligence agencies told Congress on Tuesday that North Korea is unlikely to dismantle its nuclear arsenal, that the Islamic State group remains a threat and that the Iran nuclear deal is working. The chiefs made no mention of a crisis at the U.S.-Mexican border for which Trump has considered declaring a national emergency.
>
>Their analysis stands in sharp contrast to Trump’s almost singular focus on security gaps at the border as the biggest threat facing the United States.

Lucky for you they have one right n.....oh wait

How can North Korea be a threat to US when US has far more powerful military and much bigger nuclear arsenals?

The last time North Korea sent us a bunch of bones supposedly from US soldiers, a large part of them were from animals.

That's not what the article says. The remains have to be tested to determine if they are in fact American remains or not. There is a preexisting group of people for this. The [Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency](http://www.dpaa.mil/). [The Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory](https://health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Research-and-Innovation/Armed-Forces-Medical-Examiner-System/DoD-DNA-Registry/DNA-Identifcation-Laboratory) also preexisted this case.
---
You mean they lied?

Now who could’ve possibly guessed that?

Besides a Stable Genius, of course...
---
Let's set this straight before the trolls arrive - almost all of us would like for North Korea to get on the right path, regardless of which President is in office. ***However***, many of us are watching this with great skepticism because of how North Korea has acted in these exact same situations in the past. 

This doesn't mean that we don't want NK to denuclearize or become a more friendly nation - we just aren't going to prematurely say "Mission Accomplished" until we see some real results.

TITLE: North Korea 'working on new missiles', US officials say

COMMENTS:
Ballistic missiles ≠ nuclear weapons.
---
North Korea appears to be building new ballistic missiles despite recent warming ties with the Trump administration. Unnamed US officials told the Washington Post that spy satellites had spotted continuing activity at a site that has produced ballistic missiles.

It's been unclear what both sides mean by "complete denuclearisation", and no further details have been released about when or how Pyongyang would renounce its nuclear weapons nor how the process would be verified.
---
all they have is images of vehicles arriving and leaving the facility....
---
>Another North Korean expert from MIIS, Melissa Hanham, told the BBC that the facility had "regular traffic in and out of the building", adding that this "traffic pattern" on the site stayed "about the same through the Panmunjom and Singapore meetings".

 

>She also noted that large "brightly coloured containers" also showed up in satellite imagery, saying that "containers similar to these have appeared during previous ICBM inspections by Mr Kim."

All they have is vehicles arriving and leaving the facility in the same patterns as before the agreement, while dropping off the same kinds of containers used at other ICBM sites.

But sure, go ahead and decide that you can interpret images you've never seen better than the experts in this field.

I’ve read that NK has repatriated the remains of 640 American troops since 1990. DNA analysis was likely performed upon those bodies, so this tends to convince me these latest remains are likely authentic.

I’ll put odds on most redditors being cautiously optimistic - they know that NK has previously sent the US remains, but they haven’t always been careful about what they sent us.

TITLE: Trump accuses Michael Cohen of lying 'about 95%' to congress after talks break down with Kim Jong-un

COMMENTS:
Thought experiment. 

If Cohen is a liar and because of the lies he told he is not to be trusted any more ever again under any circumstances, then Trump shares that same fate. 

Trump told the exact same lies about the exact same topics that Cohen told repeatedly and publicly. Things like the timing of Trump Tower Moscow, the level of involvement he had, what he knew about the Stormy payments, how that cover up was orchestrated, and what his involvement with it was. The list goes on. 

I can't think of a single lie that Cohen told about these issues that Trump did not also tell. By that measure, according to the GOP, trump is a liar for life and can never be trusted.

Establishing that, his statement that Cohen lied at a rate of 95 percent in his hearing cannot be trusted. 

This logically leads me to conclude that Cohen told the truth and should be believed.

Push for perjury charges then, coward. If he was lying under oath, Republicans could get him in jail for A LOT longer and bolster their case against him. Too bad that won't happen because it was all true, and Trump cannot provide any exculpatory evidence because there isn't any.

Cohen brought the receipts.

Oh, but where he said he didn't **witness** any collusion, that's the truth?

TITLE: Kim Jong-un isn't crazy, he's a smooth political operator and don't forget it

COMMENTS:
>"The reason you attacked Afghanistan is because they didn't have nukes. And look what happened to Libya. That is why we will never give up ours."

It’s a fair point.  Look what happened to Saddam when he gave up his program.  Within 5 years he was on international news looking like a caveman with a tongue depressor in his mouth.  Iran agreed to denuclearization and we have maniacs in the highest levels of government itching to invade them.  If I take off my American flag tank top and put on a gray pantsuit and think of it from KJU’s perspective, he’d be insane to give up his nukes.
---
The GOP are insane to think he would.  He was never intending to, they are his best bet at holding on to power.

COMMENTS:
How many times have they said that in the last decade?  How many times have they honored any of the agreements?

Their notion of denuclearization requires all US troops to be pulled out of South Korea, which is a non-starter for presidents who know what they're doing.

North Korea's definition of denuclearization is very different from America's.

The Acting President referred to a man who starves/tortures people and executes them in concentration camps as "his friend" today.  That shouldn't be lost in the Cohen spectacle.

TITLE: Trump Loves Praising Kim Jong-un. This Time He Told Him He's Not a Messed Up Rich Kid — Kim Jong-un killed his uncle with an anti-aircraft gun.

COMMENTS:
>Kim ordered the execution of his own uncle with an immensely powerful anti-aircraft gun that decimated his body, **which was then incinerated with a flamethrower.** This was after the uncle, Jang Song-thaek, was forced to witness two of his senior deputies get the same treatment, causing him to faint.

He's just a young misunderstood dictator. Every dictator goes through that purge stage, its part of growing up.
---
And Kim [just got busted](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/26/698405388/dutch-customs-seize-90-000-bottles-of-russian-vodka-allegedly-bound-for-north-ko) trying to smuggle 90,000 bottles of vodka into North Korea.

Rich asshole. While his people are in prison camps and/or starving.
---
Republicans like Trump love this kind of shit. They can't wait to bring this kind of Freedom stateside.
---
Kim Jong Un is literally like Trump, if Trump was an actual dictator with supreme authority over his nation.

If you take Trump, and make him have as much control over any nation that Kim has over NK, then he'd be doing the exact same things.

I find myself hoping progress will/could be made reducing to reducing tensions with N. Korea. Unfortunately I feel the Trump administration is truly ignorant how N. Korea negotiates. 

Possibly taking a look at history as it pertains to ending the Korean conflict. There were 159 meetings, lasting two years and 17 days before a firm ceasefire. 

Estimates of 3 million N. Koreans, 1 million Chinese and 40,000 Americans had died. Below is a link which offers insight what was involved to stop the massive loss of human life. The Trump administration feels they can get the North to dispose of their nuclear weapons.

Because Kim “fawns” over the president personally, and the president gives the “kid” the unnecessary benefit of the doubt because Trump refuses or is unable to internalize intelligence on North Korea demonstrating exactly what you say.

Imagine believing that Trump is going to denuclearize North Korea.

TITLE: Trump refused to believe US intelligence on North Korea's ICBM launch because Putin told him otherwise: McCabe

COMMENTS:
>President Donald Trump believed Russian President Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence agencies on North Korea, former Deputy Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe reveals in his new book "The Threat," The Washington Post reported Thursday. The insider account told by McCabe, who clashed with Trump repeatedly before he was fired last March, is disconcerting yet consistent with the president's past behavior. McCabe joined the FBI in 1996 and worked in the Counter Terrorism Division and the National Security Branch, among other postings.
---
But as far as psychopathic dictators go, Putin is one of the more trustworthy ones. Plus have you ever actually *read* an FBI report? There are WAY more words than pictures.
---
If there is one thing Trump is against.

INTELLIGENCE
---
This is the type of stories that need to get out there in the mainstream press, and constantly talked about.  The average joe will know there is something wrong. Regular people usually believes American intelligence reports about scary foreign events like these, if they hear stories that Trump is denying these intelligence reports, and because of Putin, they're going to feel concerned about Trump.

The excerpt in Bob Woodward's book about Trump throwing a temper tantrum over placing our missile defense system in South Korea, and wanting it moved to Oregon if the Koreans weren't going to pay protection money is something that news outlets should have made well-publicized.  Regular Americans will know that cutting down the response time from 30 minutes to 5 minutes is something to be concerned about.

The ICBMs they displayed in their parades were mockups, not the real deal. No, I have a feeling this is so Kim can say "We don't have ICBMs. If we did, we would have had them in the parade." and Trump and his merry band of idiots would believe it.

Even as a longtime fan of the dark humor of "Dr. Strangelove", I'm not appreciating the decision to go with a snarky pun for the headline, DB. 

Agent Orange's been showing signs of decompensation, he's looking at a hostile House, and I'm not relying on our Backstabber-in-Chief's love of dictators to keep us immune from his potential creation of a military confrontation with DPRK in order to distract from everything else. 

Donnie Moscow has nonsensically sent troops to Texas sheerly for political reasons; I am not reassured by stories like this, when the man outsmarted by an umbrella is the one with the launch codes.

TITLE: North Korea’s Trump-Era Strategy: Keep Making A-Bombs, but Quietly

COMMENTS:
>**North Korea is making nuclear fuel and building weapons as actively as ever**, the publicly available evidence suggests. But he now appears to be borrowing a page from Israel, Pakistan and India: He is keeping quiet about it, conducting no public nuclear demonstrations and creating no crises, allowing Mr. Trump to portray a denuclearization effort as on track.

>Mr. **Kim’s new forbearance has helped keep a stream of warm words coming from Mr. Trump**. A week ago, the president praised Mr. Kim, with whom he says he has forged a special relationship, after the North Korean leader refrained from parading missiles down the streets of Pyongyang during a military celebration.

-

>Current and former intelligence officials say new assessments suggest that Mr. **Kim has carefully read Mr. Trump and concluded that as long as the optics are good, and the exchanges between the two leaders are warm, he can hold off demands for progress toward disarmament**. If Mr. Kim does not conduct tests, Mr. Trump is unlikely to call out evidence of a continued nuclear buildup.

So, Trump is being manipulated in exactly the way everyone predicted he would be.

>Still, **nuclear production continues unabated**, satellite photographs and other evidence suggest. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has not persuaded the North Koreans to turn over an inventory of their major nuclear facilities and materials, much less declare how many weapons they possess. While Mr. Kim has blown up entrances to a nuclear test site and appeared to start dismantling a test stand for missile engines, he has not allowed in any inspectors to determine whether the actions were simply for show.

["There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea"](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1006837823469735936)

>Mr. Kim’s strategy now appears to be simple: Mimic Pakistan, which conducted a major nuclear test in 1998 and deflected demands for years that it give up its weapons. Pakistan has largely succeeded. It has a substantial arsenal, and when Mr. Pompeo visited Islamabad recently, there was little public discussion of Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal.

>“Kim understands what has protected the Pakistanis,” said R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs during the George W. Bush administration.

>**“As long as you have a circle of countries who will recognize you, and will trade with you, it is very difficult for the U.S. to succeed** in getting the country to dismantle its nuclear weapons apparatus,” he said, adding, **“Trump had strong international sanctions leverage over Kim but squandered it at Singapore.”**

Decades of pressure, gone.

>**North Korea has taken advantage of the situation to step up trade with China and Russia**, in violation of United Nations resolutions. On Friday, the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, accused the Russians of trying to alter a draft United Nations report that documents the sanctions violations, and said the experts writing the report had “caved.”

>The United States has “called an urgent United Nations Security Council meeting for Monday at 10 a.m. to discuss the implementation and enforcement of U.N. sanctions on North Korea,” according to a statement from Ms. Haley’s office.

>But she has little leverage. **As long as Mr. Trump declares that the crisis is over, China and Russia will look to maintain the status quo.**

We are being played like chumps while Trump worries about his poll numbers.

>Whether they do see each other soon depends largely on the initiatives of Mr. Moon, the South Korean president, during his trip to Pyongyang. He has emerged as the most important actor in this nuclear dance, and he sees his role less as an American ally and more as a critical intermediary. **He is concerned, one senior South Korean official said, that if Mr. Trump loses the House or feels more pressure from the special counsel investigation, he may veer toward resuming threats of military action.**

And again, Trump's reckless and intentional political polarization of the country ripples over the globe.  Our allies can only cover for us for so long.
---
Trump got played.

The status quo for the US remains the same or is worse. NK has nukes, US options are limited, no one wants war so there's nowhere to maneuver. The same old tough talk would look bad after Trump softened up to them. Backtracking makes him look weak and he would have to give up his "victory".

For NK, they're keeping their nukes, got a boost in legitimacy and international recognition from summit, are having their own talks with countries in the region and the pressure on China to rein them is relieved.

It's been a win for NK but the US gained basically nothing.
---
Trump strategy appears to be: ignore N Korea’s nuclear program and tell everyone you solved a 60 year conflict based on your charming personality.
---
And also: Deny, deny, deny.
---
Trump got what he wants - favourable publicity as a "peacemaker". If you criticize the President's approach to NK then you are attacked as a Trump hater who can't stand it when he succeeds. NK goes quiet, Trump claims victory. Somewhere down the track we might all regret the failure to continue to exert pressure, but that will be someone else's problem.

I feel your pain. After he got elected I had a bunch of shithead....let's just say "friends" rubbing it in my face. I even said if he managed to do what he promised on the campaign trail WRT healthcare (cheaper and better) and other issues like this one, that I'd eat my hat and admit he had done something good.

When the ACA rollback hit, he tried to rub my face in it again, and said that I was just being a "bitter librul" despite not long after....our healthcare costs went up. Sure doesn't seem cheaper to me when the price tag went up. Same with the NK photo op.

No hurry to make the world safer with a deal that's never going to happen while he makes the world unsafe as he stands. Would be a conflict of interest.

He's not pretending that he already made the deal anymore?

Yesterday was 'pretend day', today is 'throw-a-fit day', where he usually somehow incriminates himself or contradicts a lie he made on pretend-day. Tomorrow will be 'sleep-in-golf/fox' day, to recover from his own madness.

When it all comes down to it, he's acting out on his feeling of uselessness due to his age and a dick that doesn't work much anymore, and that he can't sleep with underage prostitutes anymore because he'll get caught for sure. It's a late-life crisis that assholes tend to have; comparable to a child-like crisis.

COMMENTS:
How mainstream media handles NK reporting directly after a summit is infuriating. 

They offered to dismantle a facility that every expert has said they intended to sacrifice while keeping others (like the one at Kangson) secret.
---
So North Korea says literally the same thing they’ve been saying for literally years... got it.
---
> *"We have adopted a military agreement to end the history of tragic confrontation and the history of hostility once and for all and promised to aggressively work towards making the Korean Peninsula ... a land of peace that is freed from nuclear weapons and nuclear threats,"* Kim said while standing next to Moon. 

Translation: There are literally no improvements made in the relationship between the U.S. and North Korea, or it's negotiations. North Korea has made this compromise forever "We'll end our program, the moment you remove our weapons and leave the Korean Peninsula". 

&#x200B;
---
Im guessing Russia gave NK their nuke tech. The US should never disarm until the Russian state does.
---
*The shutdown of the Yongbyon facilities in the North would happen with expectations that the United States would honor reciprocal measures, Moon said.*
So Kim meets with China and Moon and they work out this great plan except it would probably require us to pull our Thaad defense systems out of South Korea which would put us at risk of being nuked with little warning time. Someone already got to Trump about pulling out the Thaad defense systems since I read about it in Woodwards book where Trump wanted to move them from South Korea to... Portland, Oregon.

IMO there is really no scenario where Kim can make it out unscathed he will have to answer to 25 million pissed off people Why would set himself up for that?

What seems more plausible, more so after the summit, is that Kim knows that all he has to do is swoon the president. Give him something positive to tweet about so hell be distracted by the feeding his ego him instead of calling him out

Also, the same guy (my fucking brother in law) [posted this](https://imgur.com/a/X7m81DR) with the caption:

>I don't know how true this is, but I'll share it because it definitely makes sense to a liberal. Hopefully it's not true. #idonthavetimetofactcheck

I don't know how I had the time to do this, but somehow I managed to find the 30 seconds to find a [snopes article](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/article-54-of-obamacare/) that claims this is false:

>However, the full text of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act does not include an Article 54, nor does it include any provision for using 30% of seniors’ Social Security payments to cover the funding of insurance of undocumented immigrants. 

>Moreover, this claim originated solely with “The “America – Love It Or Leave It” Facebook page, which is part of a network of fake news sites and Facebook pages that engage in political trolling under the guise of providing “satire.”

So as not to believe Snopes without fact checking, I spent another 30 seconds searching for the text of the Affordable Care Act. Then spent another 30 seconds scrolling and using Ctrl+F to see that there is indeed no reference to any (not even one) of the claims made by that meme. 

It is so frustrating how easy and quick it is to debunk these things and to see through the lies but how readily the right is to post them simply because "it seems like it should be true" or "seems to be like what a liberal would do." They have built a fantasy land.

This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/nukes-07252018142754.html) reduced by 76%. (I'm a bot)
*****
> The Central Committee of the ruling Workers&#039; Party has decreed that North Korea will not relinquish its nuclear arsenal, which it termed a &quot;Precious legacy&quot; of the country&#039;s late leaders, according to local sources, despite an earlier pledge by party chairman Kim Jong Un to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.

> North Korea began acquiring the basic knowledge necessary to develop a nuclear weapons program in the 1950s, under Kim Jong Un&#039;s grandfather Kim Il Sung-the nation&#039;s founder-and producing plutonium in the late 1980s under his father Kim Jong Il, before testing its first nuclear device in 2006.

> &quot;The high-ranking party officials were listening to the speakers at the meeting because they were trying to determine whether Kim Jong Un really doesn&#039;t intend to give up nuclear weapons or if it was just part of a ploy to gain leverage in negotiations over the denuclearization process,&quot; he said.

So what did we give up those exercises for? Why have we diminished our standing on the peninsula? Also, when is that Nobel getting handed out?

COMMENTS:
So basically North Korea is not deneuclearizing.

People have to stop being fooled by Trump's bullshitting. They agreed to nothing but the word "denuclearization."

Trump and Kim don't have the same definition and Trump had no interest in hashing out those differences. He just wanted to come home to wave around a "yes" to claim a win.

The Kims always defined denuclearization as the US removing it's nuclear capable systems from the peninsula.

That being said, nothing is different now than it was a month ago.

This is all a distraction from the border crisis.
---
Because that would require verification and accountability, and this administration doesn't do that.
---
So there's not really an agreement then?
---
Crazy how much they bitched about the inspection/verification of the Iran deal, and ditched it because it wasn't harsh enkugh, but they're just going to take Kim's word on it. This administration is so obviously dishonest

So, he’s claiming a win for North Korea as actually a win for us, while being a huge loss for South Korea.

Oh, and also, he’s not that sure anymore that North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat. 

He didn’t make any agreement with Kim Jong Un. All they did was pinky promise and now they’re *committed* to a deal based on trust rather than concrete goals and requirements.

TITLE: Most Americans say it’s too early to judge Singapore summit’s success; poll shows big partisan differences

COMMENTS:
That’s because those who feel it was a success would have screamed for Obama’s impeachment if he had even *met* KJU without any written confirmation of concessions NK were going to acknowledge and adhere to as part of any “agreement”.

Shit man, their leader claimed the Iran Nuclear deal - a deal agreed to and co-signed globally by our allies that literally ***stopped*** Iran from developing any nukes. - was the “worst deal ever!” That deal secured the safety of our allies in the Middle East, who were fearful Iran could initiate a nuclear holocaust on them, but Obama negotiated terms Iran had to adhere to - and guess what?? They fucking did!

What did Trump get KJU to do? He got KJU to....get ***Trump*** to have our military quit strutting the US’ military muscle in demonstrations with the SK military as a show of force. 

Wait....that was our concession.

Um; he got KJU to....say “I think I may denuclearize”

Brilliant, way to go, Trump!!! Awesome! You’re the first leader to get him to make that statement, congr-....wait, what? 

Shit, apparently, he’s made that claim numerous times; and when he did, we didn’t make any concessions at all.
---
as if you know fucking anything about it except what you regurgitate directly from the rightwing propaganda machine, right down to the exact syntax. All the Koreans I know are appalled at Trump's concessions and scared of what comes next. 

the hell do you think they had rush Pompeo over to call them down over the joint exercises concession? Because they were overjoyed? how goddamn naive.
---
not really. you can't both sides this shit when one side is fucking deranged and worshipping a piss lover.

Uh yeah "historic" in the sense we are just repeating history with the North Koreans.
[We've been here before.] (https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/09/asia/north-korean-denuclearization-promises/index.html)

>-- 1985: North Korea signs the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or the NPT -- "a landmark international treaty whose objective is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament," according to the United Nations.
>
>-- 1992: North and South Korea sign a "joint declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. "The South and the North shall not test, manufacture, produce, receive, possess, store, deploy or use nuclear weapons" and they "shall use nuclear energy solely for peaceful purposes," it states.
>
>-- 1994: North Korea pledges to the United States that it would freeze and eventually dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for international aid, including help building two power-producing nuclear reactors.
>
>-- 2002: US President George W. Bush labels North Korea, Iran and Iraq an "axis of evil," saying that "by seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger." The administration later reveals North Korea admitted to operating a secret nuclear weapons program in violation of the 1994 deal.
>
>-- 2003: The United States and other nations halt energy aid, and North Korea withdraws from the NPT. Later, the Six Party Talks begin over Pyongyang's nuclear program. The talks include the United States, China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and North Korea.
>
>-- 2005: North Korea tentatively agrees to give up its entire nuclear program, including weapons. In exchange, the United States, China, Japan, Russia and South Korea say they will provide energy assistance to North Korea, as well as promote economic cooperation.
>
>-- 2006: North Korea claims to have successfully tested its first nuclear weapon. The test prompts the UN Security Council to impose a broad array of sanctions.
>
>-- 2008: The Six Party Talks break down over North Korea's refusal to allow international inspectors unfettered access to suspected nuclear sites, according to the Arms Control Association. North Korea says the US side fails to follow through on its commitments, too.
>
>-- 2010: State media in North Korea report that the government issued a memo saying the country "will be party to nonproliferation and disarmament agreements 'on an equal footing with other nuclear weapons states.'"
>
>-- 2011: "After a meeting between Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, Pyongyang says that it would be willing to observe a moratorium on the production and testing of nuclear weapons and missiles" in the context of resumption of Six Party Talks," according to the Arms Control Association.
>
>-- 2012, North Korea agrees to suspend the operations of its Yongbyon uranium enrichment plant and begin moratoriums on nuclear and long-range missile tests. Washington promises food aid. Washington later says it suspended the food aid after North Korea said it would launch a satellite.
>
>-- 2016: North Korea signals a willingness to resume negotiations on denuclearization, according to the Arms Control Association.

Of course he did. Kim Jong Un is winning so much he's probably tired of winning at this point.

* Kim got his nuclear and ICBM technology
* Kim got recognition by the US and a seat at the big boy table
*  Kim got US concessions and assurances that military exercises would be canceled
* Kim got promises of the potential lifting of sanctions, access to the global marketplace and the possible US investment


Kim Jong Un got everything he could possibly want and more.
---
What did trump get?

Distraction from mueller.
---
So Trump is a Democrat?
---
No.  Kim Jong Un did better than *America* at the Singapore summit.  Trump did just fine.

Trump got to lay the groundwork for a shining new future of Trump-branded hotels and resorts on beautiful North Korean beaches with the one guy who can give project approval, and used the entire United States government and media to do it.

I mean, it's not often you get to show up to a deal with a professionally-made pitch video that says "Hey, you could let us build shiny new resorts on your beautiful beaches and make you a ton of money.... or we could bomb you. Your choice."

TITLE: Singapore Summit Gives Trump High Approval Ratings Ahead of Midterms

COMMENTS:
The [Reuters poll](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2018-06/2018_reuters_tracking_-_core_political_06_13_2018.pdf) cited in the article has his approval for registered voters at 43, disapproval  54. 41/54 for all adults.

[That is the lowest net approval for a president at this point in their presidency.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/)

Still too high,  but still the lowest ever.
---
41.7% currently.
---
"before the midterms" -- a single day in Trumpland is an eternity.
---
[41% and declining in the last few weeks](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo).
---
I guess 51% would be considered high approval marks for someone consistently floating in the high 30s and low 40s. 

Edit: this actually makes no mention of standard approval ratings. The 51% percent is people who think trump has something to do with NK agreeing to a summit. So not really an approval rating at all.

>WASHINGTON, June 12 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) issued the [following statement](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/sanders-statement-on-trump-kim-summit) Tuesday following President Trump and Kim Jong Un's meeting in Singapore:


>While very light on substance, the meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore represents a positive step in de-escalating tensions between our countries, addressing the threat of North Korea’s nuclear weapons, and moving toward a more peaceful future. Congress has an important role to play in making sure this is a meaningful and serious process and not just a series of photo ops.
---
This is so funny. The aggregate writer at NRO did not agree with the summit, they are disappointed with the outcome. But they are not going to miss a chance to drive a wedge between the democrats.
---
Whoa that's the zing of the week! Excellent work troll.
---
So him approving it is what? Inconvenient? Sanders is flat out wrong like always to call this giveaway to North Korea positive.

COMMENTS:
I would love to know how an agreement between a nuclear power that has no verification programs is beloved by the same people who criticized the verification programs in the Iran deal.
---
Anyone else notice the shockingly high number of "Come on fellow liberals, stop being so salty, I hate Trump but our God Emperor really knocked it out of the park this time!" comments upvoted in r/worldnews?
---
Am I wrong to be suspicious of all the "I'm a liberal who hates everything about Trump but this is amazing" comments I'm seeing on here?
---
I’m sure it’s been said already, but it must be said again, over and over. 

If this was a few years ago and it was Barack Obama who went on the exact same trip, with the exact same results, putting the NK flag on parity with the US flag, agreeing to stop military preparedness drills, weakening our defensive posture in the Asian sphere, in exchange for nothing but an unverifiable verbal agreement with absolutely no teeth, without consulting with our allies in the region, HE WOULD BE GETTING ABSOLUTELY CRUCIFIED BY THE RIGHT WING AND FOX NEWS.

Absolutely crucified. 

Add to that if he’s just spent the last week and a half taking on our allies with aids saying there is a special place in hell for the Canadian Prime Minister while talking up the honor and privilege of meeting Kim and how good and trustworthy he is?

Jesus. The inconsistency is maddening. 

There is no objective, rational, congnizant thinking for yourself in America anymore. 

It’s dead. Our for profit, sports team, infotainment media killed it. 

The exact people praising this, are the exact people who would have condemned it if it were Obama if the exact same scenario had just played out under him. 

Fuck them all.

I think you already know the answer: Intellectual and moral cogency < Cheerleading for their team.

TITLE: Grading the Singapore Summit

COMMENTS:
When even the NRO is ambivalent about the "achievements" of a Republican you know it's a failure.
---
I actually did, I wanted to see how they could make this a good thing for Trump. 

>It’s a success if:

>You think a general improvement of relations with North Korea is a desirable end in itself.

>You care deeply and sincerely about the return of American remains from the Korean War (by the way, we pay the North Koreans about $1 million for each set of remains, so this isn’t quite the “goodwill” gesture it’s being made out to be).

>You think we were in fact on the brink of war during the whole “fire and fury” chapter and that talking is always preferable to fighting.

>You think North Korea deserves to be welcomed back into the community of nations and be seen as a co-equal nation with the United States of America.

>You think any spectacle where Trump dominates the news coverage is good.

>You’re Dennis Rodman.

>You’re a Republican strategist eager to keep the peacemaker story through the midterms.

>You’re Kim Jong-un.

>It’s a failure if:

>You thought the international opprobrium on North Korea was well-deserved and maintaining pressure on the regime was a valuable and correct policy.

>You think an American president heaping praise on an evil dictator in exchange for worthless promises is grotesque.

>You thought Trump could simply walk into a room and charm North Korea out of its nuclear weapons.

>You place a high value on the issue of human rights and the evils of the North Korean gulag.

>You think U.S.–South Korea military exercises are too valuable a chip to trade for more implausible promises (though in fairness, there’s plenty of time to restart them on schedule, so this may have been a clever and costless chip — though not informing the Pentagon about this in advance strikes me as ill-advised).
---
Holy shit even NRO is shitting on Trump
---
Damn, I didn't expet NRO to be critical. Looks like the Summit was objectively an embarrassment for the United States.

Not normally an NRO reader but this one hits it just about right

COMMENTS:
> But to actively root for the failure or our nation

You mean like intentionally voting for a fucking lunatic?  Like that?  And be proud of it?

The modern right has sold it's soul (if it ever had one) and is actively involved in destroying the country, all for librul teers.
---
Yup. Calls people "angry toddlers" and then shrieks about personal attacks. He's just a troll from the Trump fetish sub.
---
I truly believe you don't care about America.

You might get a better response from the geniuses at the cartoon frog fetish sub you're so fond of.

COMMENTS:
This video is the bizzare, holywood-style "trailer" Trump showed Kim during their private meeting. Here's Trump describing that in the press conference today:

https://www.vox.com/world/2018/6/12/17452624/trump-kim-summit-transcript-press-conference-full-text

>*Q: "What was the goal?"*

>Trump: "We had it made up by — I hope you liked it. I thought it was good. I thought it was interesting enough to show. One in English and one in Korean. We had it made up. I showed it to them today. Actually during the meeting. Toward the end of the meeting. I think he loved it. They were — we didn’t have a big screen like you have the luxury. We had it on cassette. An iPad. They played it. About eight of their representatives were watching it. I thought they were fascinated by it. I thought it was well done. I showed it to you because that is the future. That could very well be the future. The other alternative is not a good alternative. It is just not good. I showed it because I really want him to do something. I don’t think I had to show it. I really believe he wants to get it done. Yes."

TITLE: Trump’s Singapore Summit Was a Bust—for the U.S.

COMMENTS:
>At the press conference at the conclusion of the summit, Trump announced that regular U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises—exercises that he chose to describe as "very provocative"—would be rolled back, granting Pyongyang a major concession.

Does that moron not understand we fought a war there at one point? That the US military presence is necessary to deter the North's aggression. Does the "commander in chief" not understand basic military readiness with our allies ensures less fuck-ups when/if it becomes go-time?
---
No.
---
He does understand that. He got them to agree to send the bones of our war dead home. So now their families can bury them secure in the knowledge that they died for nothing.
---
Long answer: Noooo
---
Short answer: No.

TITLE: Singapore Summit: Read the full text of Trump and Kim's joint statement

COMMENTS:
So, Kim gets a statement that the US will continue to legitimatize his sick regime. US gets nothing. Great deal maker.
---
"the DPRK commits to work towards complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."

There's a nothingburger if I ever saw one.
---
Well, there has been talk of opening a few fast food joints in North Korea. Maybe *nothingburger*™ is among them, that, McDonald's, Wendy's and Five Guys ...
---
So a win\-win for the two dictators in relation to their respective bases, but still no information on substance, other than that they will stop with the name calling?

NK will not be the first power ever with functioning nuclear weapons to denuclearize. Peaceful coexistence, lower levels of tensions like after the Cold War is the most optimistic option in the foreseeable future. 

My guess is that NK is looking to behave nice long enough to sway the international pressure at large, mainly from China and Russia. Even a minor decrease in de facto sanctions, including "unofficial" easing makes all the difference.

For the US to be able to keep the existing sanctions in place until a total NK denuclearization, it takes allies, and the ability to uphold trust in alliances over time.
---
No, it's the greatest document, greater than the declaration of independence and Gettysburg address combined!

TITLE: Singapore summit: Kim Jong-un says 'world will see major change'

COMMENTS:
The points in the document have already been released. Trump got rolled, just as was expected. 

Kim played him like a bitch.
---
Because its a few non\-binding, non\-committal paragraphs. It's useless.
---
Yeah. The major change is the North Korea is now recognized by the United States, and that you're better rewarded when you have complete, developed nuclear weapons, as opposed to countries who enter multilateral agreement to halt their developing nuclear program.

After this, why would anyone sign a deal to stop developing nukes? You don't have to give up a damn thing if you have nukes.
---
Ugh.  Propaganda for both dictators.  


Awesome.
---
It is 4 sentence looking paragraphs. That should be your first concern. There is no plan for any of the agreed upon points, just promises and words. The US got nothing material while NK just got the global recognition it has saught for 30 years.

TITLE: Trump Calls Kim Jong Un Meeting ‘My Honor’ in Historic Singapore Summit

COMMENTS:
>Senior White House Trade Advisor says of the Canadian Prime Minister, "There's a special place in hell for him."

>It's, "my honor," to meet with a brutal dictator whose legitimacy the United States has emphatically denied for the past 60 years, the President says less than 24 hours later.

Trying to be buddy buddy with our worst enemies.   Condemning our closest allies.  Guess we're really making America great now, am i rite?
---
It's deeply disturbing to me no one on the US side is even *pretending* to care about NK running slavery and torture camps.
---
So he's elevated a tinpot brutal dictator to the same level as a President of the United States, and received nothing in return besides vague promises, much like those from his campaign.  Now he'll go back to his rallies and pretend that this was a major accomplishment, whereas in reality NK has been wanting to be treated as an equal of the United States since the beginning.
---
Does anyone remembers Obama bowing too low to an allied leader? I members.
---
What scares me is Trump will leave the meeting with new ideas.

TITLE: How Kim Jong Un will play Trump at their summit in Singapore

COMMENTS:
I mean I think any normal person can see whats abiut to happen. Kim praises the fuck out of Trump. China and Russia already have a deal to sign for us. Trump signs it. They all smile. We give all the power to Russia and China to solve it. Somehow we pay for it all...
---
>Kim isn't flying to Singapore to show off how much of a statesman he is. 

You don't seem to be aware of how important this is to dictators. It's well researched and well known. There is a ton of historic evidence for this and it continues today. Is it his only goal? No. But it is a major function of these talks. 

It's not surprising though, coming from a Trump supporter. I shouldn't expect you to really have a firm grasp of geopolitics. 

After all, Trump's version of global diplomacy is so completely terrible that i shouldn't expect anyone who still supports it to have any idea of what's going on. 

If you think Kim is desperate to save his people from starvation then you haven't been paying attention for the last 30 years.
---
Kim Jong Un won the moment that he got Trump to agree to even discuss a face to face meeting without Japan, South Korea, and China in the room and at the table.  

He needs do nothing else; all else is a bonus to him.

Kim has gotten his outlaw pariah state elevated to the same level as the most powerful country on earth.  He's already won even if nothing comes from this.

>So far, Mr. Kim’s bet has paid off handsomely. Since beginning his overture a month before the Winter Olympics in South Korea, he has been awarded a meeting with President Xi Jinping of China, who had earlier treated him with thinly disguised contempt. He was welcomed by Mr. Moon with a South Korean honor guard. **And he is on the verge of something once inconceivable: a meeting with the American president.**

>Though Mr. Kim made gestures of his own — a pledge not to test bombs or long-range missiles, and an end to the North’s longtime insistence that American troops withdraw from the peninsula — **he has not made any tangible concessions on his nuclear weapons. The language in his joint statement with Mr. Moon about denuclearization was both vague and familiar to veterans of past negotiations with North Korea.**

>“He’s gotten all these meetings with world leaders **without making any concessions**,” said Jung H. Pak, a former C.I.A. analyst who is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center for East Asia Policy Studies. “So far, everything has been no-cost for Kim.”

[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/us/politics/trump-north-korea.html)

Kim wins whether or not he makes any concessions. Just making an American President come to meet him would be a concession and an accomplishment. If he walks away without anything he has stood up to a bully.  

 Trump, on the other hand, is desperate not to appear empty-handed. If he does he'll look like he was played for a fool.    He also needs to redirect his military towards the Middle East to [satisfy his donors.](http://lobelog.com/trumps-choice-of-bolton-satisfies-his-biggest-donor/)

Kim knows this, and will play Donald for all he can get.

TITLE: Kudlow: Trudeau hurt Trump’s prestige before Singapore summit

COMMENTS:
Trump has no prestige, never had, never will.
---
>“He is not going to permit any show of weakness a trip to negotiate with North Korea,” Kudlow said of the president. “Kim must not see American weakness.”
>
Kudlow urged Trudeau to apologize.
>
“Trudeau made an error. He should take it back,” Kudlow said. “He should pull back on his statements and wish President Trump well in the Korea negotiations.”

trump lost any credibility to criticize by leaving early.  This is quite simply Trudeau making scheduled closing remarks.  And Trudeau told this to trump's face when he was there.  This is in no way connected to trump's kim meeting.  It is about the tariffs trump himself imposed.
---
Yep this is pre-placing blame because we all know Trump will fuck up the summit if he can’t get exclusive hotel rights to the DPRK.
---
He did that himself by being a giant prick, you sycophantic weasel
---
Getting spanked by porn stars while watching shark week probably didn't help his prestige either.

TITLE: Trump and Kim Jong Un arrive in Singapore for historic summit ⋆ Moha News

COMMENTS:
President Trump arrived here Sunday night ahead of a potentially historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the first meeting between the leaders of two countries that have been sworn enemies for almost seven decades.

Air Force One touched down with little fanfare at Paya Lebar Air Base in Singapore, landing a few hours after Kim arrived in the island state. Trump waved as he stepped off the presidential aircraft, briefly greeted Singaporean officials on the tarmac and quickly climbed into a limousine to head to his hotel for the evening.

TITLE: President Trump Arrives In Singapore for Historic North Korean Summit | NBC News

COMMENTS:
It literally doesn't matter.

Let me explain. How it goes is completely disconnected from how Trump supporters will *feel* about how it goes. If he drops trou and shits in the hors d'oeuvres, Trump's cult will insist it demonstrates "strength" in some way. No matter what happens, they'll insist it was another example of Trump playing 57D Pokemon.
---
Hopefully.  Good for her.
---
Yep. They spun Trump canceling this summit as a "win" and then when NK said they'd meet with China without the US, and the US basically begged to be let back in, they spun that as a "win". 

Doesn't matter what happens, Trump will walk out and proclaim great victory, historic event, Obama failed where he succeeded, etc. And his cult will believe it and spin it to be even better for him.
---
>Can someone explain how this goes well for the President? 

He doesn't do anything too crazy like agree to pull U.S. forces out of South Korea, and begins a long process of negotiating some sort of serious deal with teeth to contain North Korea.   That would be the best outcome we could realistically expect, I think.  

> What are the chances that NK does denuclearize? 

Zero.  It got them a seat at the grown-ups table, and it has been their national goal for a long time to be a nuclear power.

>If they agree to do so and then don't Trump is seen as being played. 

Yes.   They have agreed to a lot in the past, and played presidents a whole lot smarter and better prepared than Trump.  

>If they don't agree Trump is seen as giving NK legitimacy by meeting with them and being played.

By just sitting down with Kim face to face, some claim this is already a huge propaganda victory for North Korea.   By agreeing to a summit with absolutely no preconditions, Trump has rushed into a trap that previous presidents avoided.


>...as US diplomats worked to set up the presidential visit, it became clear that North Korea and the US were too far apart on the details of the missile pact to justify handing Kim the **huge concession** of a Clinton visit.
>
>"Really they were stuck on one issue. North Korea was willing to stop selling missiles and North Korea was even willing to stop making missiles. But North Korea was not willing to give up the missiles it had," said Jeffrey Lewis, a non-proliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.
>
>"North Korea seemed to be holding back their last concession so that they could get the big visit, and the Clinton administration knew that the visit was the big deliverable and they wanted to spend it very carefully," he said.

So Canada and France are bad.

North Korea and China are good.

Got it.

Welcome to 2018, where the American President is compromised by the Russians, and no member of the GOP has the balls to fulfill their constitutional obligation.

"He is not going to permit any show of weakness on the trip to negotiate with North Korea ...” -Kudlow

Hissy fits and tantrums are a classic show of weakness.
---
They equate brute force and brashness with strength.

It's why it's always been said that Trump is the weak man's idea of what a strong man is.

That isn't strength.  That's just being an asshole and telegraphing how weak you actually are.

And it doesn't get you very far when you can't "bully" the people around that you're dealing with.
---
They have the nuke.  It's the delivery system that they're still struggling with.  They can somewhat deliver with liquid fuel, but until they get solid fuel technology down, we feel confident we can keep them in check.  They don't need to test any more nuclear weapons.  They have the actual exploding shit part down pretty good.  

The problem is, this isn't a meeting to stop NK from doing anything.  This is a photo op.  This meeting could have been setup with any POTUS from the last 30-40 years.  No other POTUS was stupid enough to take this meeting without some major concessions by NK.  

NK is giving up nothing, but is getting all the recognition and respect they've wanted for the last several decades.  

And with Trump running around bragging about how he essentially solved the NK problem before he did anything, Trump is in a horrendously weak negotiating position.  Trump will give up anything to get something now.  He feels he doesn't have a choice.  He has to come back home claiming he did something.  Meanwhile KJU will go back to NK claiming victory over the Americans.

>The president’s failure to engage in real prep—before his rushed Singapore Summit with Kim and before this latest summit in Vietnam—means that North Korea has had 12 more months to become stronger, not only because Kim did his prep work.

That is really all there is to say about this. No other president would be willing to meet with North Korea unless an agreement had already been hammered out and there had already been a bunch of concessions made to ensure that something like this would not happen.

TITLE: President Trump and Kim Jong Un Summit in Hanoi - Day 2 | Live Discussion Thread

POST: President Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un meet today in Hanoi, Vietnam, for their second summit. The President will look to convince Kim to abandon his nuclear program. However, a common definition of denuclearization doesn't yet exist, and Kim hasn't committed to a timeline of any sort, sources said. Trump previously met with Kim in Singapore last summer, where the North Korean leader agreed to ‘work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.’

COMMENTS:
Well it’s 2019 and a summit between the NK Dictator and the President of the USA is literally non news. Trump ‘s controversies have literally run ahead of him taking the limelight away. How ironic
---
Who the hell cares about this shit? We had 5 Game Threads on Cohen's hearing, fuck this weak attention-seeking shit.
---
Its because none of this matters, NK will not denuclearize and this allows propaganda for NK
---
Honestly, Kim could just tell Trump he will commit to total denuclearization, and get whatever he wants. Trump would proceed to proclaim “Mission Accomplished”. Then, when nothing happens and the intelligence community says so, Trump will just say they are wrong.

TITLE: President Trump and Kim Jong Un Summit in Hanoi | Live Discussion Thread

POST: President Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un meet today in Hanoi, Vietnam, for their second summit. The President will look to convince Kim to abandon his nuclear program. However, a common definition of denuclearization doesn't yet exist, and Kim hasn't committed to a timeline of any sort, sources said. Trump previously met with Kim in Singapore last summer, where the North Korean leader agreed to ‘work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.’

COMMENTS:
This was what Trump stated when he arrived in Vietnam -

>I have now spent more time in Vietnam than Da Nang Dick Blumenthal, the third rate Senator from Connecticut (how is Connecticut doing?). His war stories of his heroism in Vietnam were a total fraud - he was never even there. We talked about it today with Vietnamese leaders! [Source](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1100666476422410240)

From Cohen's opening statement today -

>Mr. Trump tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft. Mr. Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment. He finished the conversation with the following comment. “You think I’m stupid, I wasn’t going to Vietnam.”

Just in case anyone wants any further info on this -

>Blumenthal received five draft deferments during the Vietnam War which were mainly related to educational deferments, and then deferments based on his occupation. With part-time service in the reserves or National Guard generally regarded as an alternative for those wishing to avoid serving in Vietnam in April 1970 Blumenthal enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve, and he served in units in Washington, D.C., and Connecticut from 1970 to 1976, attaining the rank of sergeant.  During his 2010 Senate campaign, news reports that Blumenthal had claimed or implied that he'd served "in Vietnam" during the war created a controversy. Blumenthal denied having intentionally misled voters into believing he fought in Vietnam, but acknowledged having occasionally "misspoken" about his service record, and later apologized for remarks about his military service he said had not been "clear or precise". 

Blumenthal basically glorified his service record more than he should have and owned up to this and apologised for his bahaviour.

>Trump also had five draft deferments during the Vietnam War with 4 of them relating to educational deferments. The fifth deferment (in October 1968) was a medical deferment due to him having bone spurs in his heels even though in he was deemed fit for service based upon a medical examination both in 1966 and on July 1968 (3 months before his deferment). Trump did not complete any full or part time service in the reserves or National Guard. He did not enlist in United States Marine Corps Reserve and did not serve in units in Washington, D.C., and Connecticut from 1970 to 1976 and was never a ranked officer. 

Trump basically dodged his draft by bribing a the right person and we now know via Cohen that trump has no medical records to back his bullshit bonespurs claim up and had never received any surgery to fix his (even though he's been golfing for decades).

>I have now spent more time in Vietnam than Da Nang Dick Blumenthal, the third rate Senator from Connecticut (how is Connecticut doing?). His war stories of his heroism in Vietnam were a total fraud - he was never even there. We talked about it today with Vietnamese leaders!

Even after 2 years of Trump, I checked if this is a really a quote from his Twitter account because I could not believe that would be the first thing that came to his mind when he landed in Vietnam.

He’s called Kim his friend...dude tortured and killed Americans along with his own people...

Pathetic time in human history. We can only do better, I hope.

This statement is applicable to so many countries right now.

And I agree with all of them.
---
War is indeed a massive, massive business, and most of us are so insulated from it, it's almost an abstract. This is by design.

I have to hold out hope for my country, but my hope has been shaken by these past two years. Only a sea change (after the end of the current admin.) can turn us back from the abyss. Let's hope we have it in us.
---
What's disturbing is how often people talk about history, yet we walk into these situations despite having our eyes open.

Part of me hopes that this is like a puberty for America. The last grandstand of a dying and obsolete culture based on genetic superiority. The only issue is that it that it taps into something primal within all of us, and is extremely easy to profit off.

Big bucks in war. And for the most powerful people on earth, that is all it boils down to.

Where did he get, exactly? NK isn't disarming. Isn't going to disarm. Tensions have gone down, I'll grant that, but that's the only change I see, and Kim got a huge boost of legitimacy out of that bargain, so really it seems to me like he's the main winner here.

Yeah.  If you call giving Kim everything he wants in exchange for a few vague promises.  Trump just wants some kind of agreement so he can come back and campaign.  He is now consumed with something he understands, reality TV campaign 2020

🍄rump gonna get mushroom dicked all because he wants a "win."  Mr Un still building his nukes/missiles and all that has changed is an now he has an American president calling him good people so his media arm can sell it to his Korean people that he is powning the Americans.  Just look at NK news of late and see the messages.  Seriously, watch it and listen.  🍄rump is getting played and he doesn't care.  He just wants to look good, for the short term.

If you believe the North would not have overrun  the South without US presence, I have some good deals on bridges for you.

In what MAGA school did they teach you we fought a war with France? Because we never have, however we fought a war with what is now the DPRK from Jun 25, 1950 – Jul 27, 1953 which is still ongoing do you see the difference?
---
You do know that Japan doesn't do the whole military thing, right? The US has bases there and provides military protections. It's in the treaty that ended WWII.
---
The article makes a good point, though, in that a peace declaration may be the start of pressuring the US to withdraw troops from the Korean Peninsula. In fact, the Chinese may have asked Kim to push for a peace declaration in order to start this process going. 

If we don’t get denuclearization, we shouldn’t quit South Korea. That would be very dangerous. Hopefully, Trump will listen to his security experts about navigating these peace talks or whatever they in fact are.

God fucking dammit man. When I first heard of the summit all I could think about is what is Kims end game when, if the peace plan worked, millions of North Koreans find out that he kept them in a dystopian state all these years? 

The summit  was a fucking trap from the beginning, and everyone saw it. But Trumps ego didn't give a fuck about the ramifications of meeting with a regime that had a well documented history of lying and being subversive. Trump wanted a win, no matter how superficial it was. He would be able to tweet about his historic event and be adulated. He wanted his rallies to shower him with praise. He would would soak in the glory to the chants of NOBEL. 

The only thing this shitshow has accomplished was to solidify and reinforce Kims hold on power. Imagine how effective the propaganda campaign would be. Kim was able to meet the leader of the country they hate the most and made him his bitch.

COMMENTS:
Boy, Trump sure is an idiot.

Kim knows it will never happen, which means he'll never denuclearize.  And as much of a crazy dictator as Kim might be, is he wrong?  Why should any country denuclearize just because the US says so?  

Further...why should Kim do so when he has the example of at least two other dictators (Muammar Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein) who abandoned their nuclear ambitions and ultimately ended up dead.

I'm in no way arguing that a nuclear North Korea is good for the world, or something I personally find agreeable, but there isn't really a single logical reason for Kim to denuclearize.

The North Korea denuclearization plan has gone nowhere because there's nowhere for it to go: the summit with Kim was just another political stunt for Trump.  

The summit was a series of photo ops, a butt-ugly coin and a lot of self-aggrandizing blather, but accomplished nothing definite or  substantive.  Trump got played like a fiddle by a con artist far more skilled than himself, returned home, bloviated, then pretty much let the chips fall where they may.


The situation will most likely fester, allowing Kim to actually dramatically increase his nuclear capabilities, rather than denuclearize, leaving the whole mess for the next president to deal with - unless of course, Kim's expansion of his capabilities leads to a nuclear exchange.

> "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula"

Has for a long time been North Korean speak for the U.S. getting out of South Korea.

Since that's not going to happen, Kim will basically do whatever the hell he feels like, and say that the U.S. isn't living up to their end of the bargain.

Meanwhile, Orangeblossom is leaving the anti nuclear proliferation clubhouse! He wants to bring back the 1980's when his penis still sorta worked and there was nothing you couldn't fix with someone else's money and some good smelling coke. Nothing will bring back the 80's like a nice, cold war!


Besides, the only language dictators understand is hypocrisy, and how can Orangeblossom get Sugarplum to ~~disrobe~~ denuclearize without more of Putin's mighty missiles?
---
I think North Korea should hold onto their nuclear arsenal until peace is decleared and somehow I feel like they do too.

Please give up all your weapons that would be extremely useful in war to us the enemy before we considering ending our war.... Yeah that's really a logical move to give up everything used in war when the other side laughs at even the idea of doing the same

I just can’t think Obama enough for all he did for this country. We’re still enjoying the fruits of Obama’s flawless presidency. A booming economy and now denuclearization of North Korea thanks to his foreign policy and diplomacy. Cheeto fuckface on the other hand has done everything in his power to start nuclear war with North Korea via twitter and crash the  economy by implementing tariffs that economists agree are reckless and only serve his self interests. It’s amazing our economy is still in the shape it is with all of the reckless shit he’s done.

North Korea's Kim deeply understands how to manipulate Trump and thus the US. He wrote a nice letter to Trump and then thanks him while improving and building his nuclear armaments. 

Given that nukes are Kim's trump cards, how likely do you really believe he'll give them up?

Keep saying nice things about Trump, thank him from time to time, and carry on as usual--that seems to be Kim's working strategy.

>re-negotiating trade

He got a promise to maybe sometime look at trade with Mexico, and current renegotiation efforts for NAFTA are a total clusterfuck.

> [denuclearization] was impossible

DPRK has been pushing for "denuclearization" for as long as they've had nukes. The catch is that they interpret it to mean "no nuclear powers on the Korean peninsula" which means the US completely pulling out.

KJU also can do this thing called *lie* where by pretending to want to negotiate in good faith, can get concessions from the US and then just continue to work on their nuclear program.

> U.S. officials involved in the latest negotiations have said North Korea has refused to even start discussions about defining “denuclearization” or other key terms such as “verifiable” and “irreversible”, and has insisted the United States must first agree to simultaneous steps to reduce economic pressure. 


> U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Pyongyang in July, after which North Korea accused him of making “unilateral and gangster-like demands for denuclearization” while showing little interest in ending the war. 

The situation does not look optimistic. North korea have refused to even talk with Usa. So according to article North korea wants  their sanction  lifted first  and they want get  Usa troops out from South korea 100% percent. Stalling the war games was not enough for them. They want Usa make biggest sacrifice first.

TITLE: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wants to denuclearize during Trump's first term: Seoul officials

COMMENTS:
Key part:

>During the Wednesday meeting, Kim emphasized that the initial steps North Korea has already taken — including dismantling its underground nuclear test site and a missile engine facility — means the country has ended nuclear and long-range missile testing "for good", Chung said.  
>  
>"If reciprocation is shown for North Korea's preemptive measures that have already been completed, he strongly expressed his will that more active measures for North Korea's denuclearization can be taken."

It is widely believed by experts that DPRK is no longer in need of the testing site as its missile technology has advanced to a sufficient level. So this was not really a concession towards denuclearisation. And as these steps have already been taken, Kim expects the US to reciprocate before DPRK moves further forward with de-nuking. Which means that the US must make concessions to DPRK before further progress is made. That seems highly unlikely at the present time.
---
Lol, wow, talk about fake news.
---
> You could say the same about Iran.

The key difference being that Iran had yet to develop a nuclear weapon, and were given incentives not to.   

> Both China and North Korea beleive that Trump may be one of their best chances at getting a deal.

North Korea has a long history of making deals with both parties.

> Getting this done during Trumps term has been a goal for China 

Not at all.  If that were anywhere close to being true, China would not have eased up on sanctions on North Korea after the Singapore photo op.   China is interested in maintaining a buffer state between itself and the U.S. forces in SK, otherwise they would not have assisted North Korea with their nuclear program.
---
Do you seriously think Kim plans on getting rid of his nukes, let alone gives a fuck if it's in "trumps first term"? 

Lol, if you do, I have a trump university diploma you can buy.

If I'm not mistaken, all the reports are coming back that they havent taken any steps towards denuclearization

What progress have we definitively made?

Mr. Trump played all his cards that NK wanted, and having gotten recognition by a Superpower summit, NK doesn't need Trump any more, he's got nothing to give them, & having gotten into a pissing match with China and having lost any power with Russia by engaging in political fellatio with Putin, he can't apply any meaningful sanctions against him.  No wonder Mr. Trump has been bankrupt repeatedly, he just can't deal with real problems.

Really cause that is exactly what happened in step 1. NK said some bad things, Trump cancelled, NK begged to come back to the table, denuclearization starts.

I would rather put my trust in the man who has actually made progress, than side with bias reporters and Democratic shills who have done nothing but preach gloom and doom.

Denuclearization talks while they clean up their mess at whatever went wrong at their testing facility, and move everything to a new location, was a healthy move. Trump got played. Kim came to the table to ease tensions so he could move more freely and lower scrutiny. And right about now, all of that has been moved, and we're back to where we were.

Kim had nothing to lose by meeting with Trump. Trump gave him a world stage and legitimacy as an international leader. I would guess that Kim never intended to reach a deal with Trump or make any progress whatsoever, which is exactly what North Korea has been doing for decades.

>Lavrov, who is also visiting Vietnam this week,

Those photos of Trump with Lavrov in the Oval Office are the only ones I can think of where Trump looks genuinely happy and satisfied. There are also the only photos I've seen where it looks like he isn't wearing any orange makeup. 

This week should be interesting, he's meeting the man he says he is "in love with", and the man who seems to be able to let him take his hair down and really be himself, and meanwhile his former best friend, Michael Cohen, is going to be snitching on him in front of Congress.

Spoiling a narcissist's big day out is a potential shitfest of epic proportions.   

I really hope the Pentagon has been smart enough to replace the nuclear football with that actual football that Putin gave to Trump.

TITLE: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will reportedly hold talks with North Korea this week

COMMENTS:
The process would be long and very messy but the chance of North Korea actually trying something once this occurs is very slim. Tensions between the two countries have been on a steady decline, although the possibility of North Korea becoming more aggressive after America is no longer protecting South Korea always exists as North Korean leaders have always said they will only call for reunification after America leaves South Korea. South Korea has a fairy adequate military, and the biggest threat would be artillery strikes on the South Korean capital; it is physically not possible for South Korea to be conquered by North Korea as of now, even without America. 

We would be losing a major strategic location and this decision would most likely not be supported by the South Korean government, so expect our relationship with South Korea to become a lot shakier. 


All in all South Korea is one of our major allies and the cost of having troops there heavily outweighs the costs of not having them.

I heard that Trump almost withdraw all Amercian troops from Korea last Febuary.

How about free elections in North Korea, and the freeing of at least some prisoners?

They sure do have awfully high expectations, don't they?

The fact that Trump basically offended every party involved is pretty worrisome. The bar for doing better is very low.

TITLE: Russia offered North Korea a nuclear power plant to interfere with Trump's negotiations, report reveals

COMMENTS:
Imagine knowing this happened and still believing Putin wants better relations with the US. You now know what it's like to be a Republican
---
The thing to remember is Trump's family and their band of crony goblin traitors are tools. Trump is not allied with Putin. Russia is able to manipulate Trump by having kompromat in addition to taking advantage of his ego, greed and insecurities.

Putin has aspirations and diminishing the global power of the US while using the current position of the US to destabilize NATO,  for instance, helps create diatractions and opportunities.

Anything that creates chaos for Trump only helps to make him more unstable which plays into Russia's agenda.

Trump is a tool.
---
exactly, in reality anybody with a brain knows that the love only goes one way...Trump sees a "smart guy" that understands how smart HE is...in reality Putin sees a bumbling idiot that can be played and manipulated left and right.
---
Putin is playing Trump for the fool that he is. Trump grovels at the feet of Putin, not the other way around. 

Now the question is, why does Trump continue to lick Putin’s boots if he knows that Putin is screwing him over? 🤔
---
i really, really hope this is not one of those posts in here that ends up with 0 points and a shitload of comments because people presume, from simply reading the headline, that this somehow disproves the collusion theory and therefore is problematic. therefore it must be downvoted.

>SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un spoke highly of  U.S. President Donald Trump, expressing satisfaction over results of  recent talks between the country’s delegation and U.S. officials to  discuss the second summit between him and Trump, state media said on  Thursday.    
>  
>Kim said he will trust in Trump’s positive way of  thinking, KCNA said, weeks after Kim warned North Korea could seek a  “new path” if U.S. sanctions and pressure against the country continued,  suggesting the North Korean leader is focused on the sit-down with  Trump to produce results.

Jong-un wants legitimacy. He doesn't care about his people or their plight so sanctions aren't that big of a deal to him. He still lives lavishly while his people are crippled and can't resist his regime.  Meeting the President of the US provided everything Jong-un wanted. Trump was played.

It's from Star Trek. Captain Picard is being brain washed. There are four lights above him and they are forcing him to say there are five using torture methods. In the end when he is rescued he screams at his torturer: "There are four lights."

You wouldn't know this of course unless you watched Star Trek.

Kim is not as crazy as people think.  He realizes that if he gives up his weapons that he will have 0 leverage.  U.S. would demand he conform to human rights which would immediately result him him losing power and being murdered.        

In all fairness, he inherited this problem.         
          
His only real option would be to give up power and seek sanctuary elsewhere and even then, the people he's harmed and their families would seek vengeance no matter where he went.

TITLE: Top secret report: North Korea keeps busting sanctions, evading U.S. led sea patrols

COMMENTS:
"Fake News, Kim gave me a beautiful letter!"
---
Hard to enforce sanctions when China and Russia are helping them evade the sanctions
---
This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/top-secret-report-north-korea-keeps-busting-sanctions-evading-u-n947926) reduced by 88%. (I'm a bot)
*****
> By Courtney Kube and Dan De Luce.WASHINGTON - A top secret U.S. military assessment found that North Korea is still evading U.N. sanctions by transferring oil at sea, and that a coalition of U.S.-led forces deployed to disrupt the movements has failed to dent the overall number of illegal transfers, three U.S. officials familiar with the intelligence told NBC News.The finding underscores the Trump administration&#039;s struggle to maintain economic pressure on North Korea amid a diplomatic bid to persuade Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear and missile arsenal.

> The assessment found that while attempts to transfer oil have not decreased, the coalition presence has forced North Korea out of the East China Sea and into more logistically challenging areas to the north and south.

> Some lawmakers have long urged the U.S. to go after major Chinese banks or firms suspected of enabling North Korea&#039;s evasion of sanctions, arguing that Beijing helps insulate its neighbor from the full effect of international sanctions.

COMMENTS:
Nope. At first I feel like they saw him as a crazed hawk looking for a fight but now they realize he's a 5 year old child who just keeps throwing a fit until he gets what he wants.
---
I know you're not here to be honest, but I'm going to educate anyone that may be fooled by your comment: the people of North Korea are fed propaganda from a government that hates Western society. They have no actual idea of what America is like, are constantly told that we eat children and want nothing more than to see them all dead. North Koreans are always starving and it's not entirely because they can't grow anything, it has more to do with Kimmy boy wanting to keep his army and himself fed while the populace stays weak.

Perpetual survival of the Kim dynasty is something the US will never willingly allow, if they give up the nuclear programme they will be attacked by the US eventually, there really isn't anything to discuss, the Kim's need the nukes to survive otherwise they die. What's to negotiate?
---
Let's see if trump can listen to his generals.
---
There is nothing you can do. How many time Usa has pressured North?
---
Wait, weren't we all done with it?  Wasn't NK going to denuke completely because Donny allowed Kim to hold his hand and have his picture taken with him?  Didn't Donny say NK was no longer a nuclear threat?  Are they suggesting Donny's meeting with Kim didn't do anything like what Trump has been telling everyone it did?  Are they suggesting nuclear diplomacy might require more effort than a photo session with Trump?

Who knew international nuclear diplomacy could be so difficult?

TITLE: In Trump’s North Korea diplomacy, China is the loser

COMMENTS:
Except for China getting exactly what they want - promises to end military drills with South Korea and Trump talking about pulling US troops out of South Korea.

The two talking directly doesn't cut China out at all. Kim *literally* just took a plane back there to meet with Xi again. A *plane*, not his usual armored train.

China is winning, and they're even making empty promises in return.

"To Mr. Trump’s credit, he correctly described the U.S.-led war games as “very provocative,” which simulate a full-scale invasion of North Korea every spring."  
Her assessment of the situation is naïve (based on passages similar to the one above), but logical. She assumes granting NK a larger role in world economics will moderate their behavior. One could argue that granting dictatorships larger roles in the global economy moderates their behavior, but also the behavior of countries like the United States, who in opening China up to the global economy have normalized slavish working conditions and put a large portion of the world economy in the hands of a non-democratic government.

Wait, there was a chance of North Korea invading US and/or preemptively attacking the US with a nuke? Maybe only when they thought US will nuke them first.

It really says something about US media that Most Americans are convinced that a tiny, weak country halfway around the world would attack the world’s only superpower. 

North Korea developed their nuclear weapons program as a deterrent to US invasion of their country.

I guess Alex Lockie ignored a report that stated that even though they chose not to display ICBMs, NK has been increasing its import of fissile material for more bombs.   

This was NK playing people like him so they can bide time and make more bombs.  Then again a quick look at Lockie's twitter shows he should probably ask Georgia State U for a refund.

TITLE: Trump Betrayed Our Military by Saluting North Korea

COMMENTS:
Not what you expect from Jared's site, his daddy-in-law ain't gonna be happy with him.

>As for actual diplomacy, there wasn’t much on display in Singapore. This was a glorified photo op, hardly a bona fide summit, much less a significant diplomatic happening—except for the fact that it happened at all. Pyongyang received the famous Trumpian thumbs-up before the cameras, for the world to see. In return, North Korea gave, well, nothing, really. There are vague assurances in the joint declaration signed by Trump and Kim in Singapore about “complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” notwithstanding that Pyongyang has demanded that for decades, by which they mean getting American nuclear weapons out of South Korea. Although the administration is promising “major disarmament” by Pyongyang imminently, no seasoned Korea-watchers consider that likely.

Trump was amazed at how “tough” North Korea’s soldiers were. How much more can you disrespect your own military with that comment?

TITLE: ‘Those are literally the North Korean and Chinese talking points’: why Trump’s decision to halt military exercises with South Korea makes allies nervous

COMMENTS:
The suspension of military exercises is not the main problem. The problem is not consulting with South Korea first (and Pentagon), along with parroting North Korean and Chinese rhetorics.
---
It's also troubling, to say the least, that Trump ignored all of NK's human rights violations and praised Kim as a great man without reservation, has adopted their rhetoric, saluted their generals. He's clearly not representing America's best interests.
---
No, there's nuance. Obama wouldn't have made an agreement with no verification method like this nor would he not consult key allies regarding the situation
---
>He's also not representing any of US allies' interests. 

You're right. Trump has made it clear he doesn't care about America's allies. I have no doubt America will pay dearly for Trump's betrayals.  I'm equally concerned about South Korea's well-being. They will bear the consequences of Trump's strategic errors.  South Korea has been a staunch ally for over half a century and Trump is casting them aside the same way he ditches his investors after he swindles them.  The fact the right are supporting this catastrophe sets them beyond the pale - as if they hadn't arrived there already.

>So far, Mr. Kim’s bet has paid off handsomely. Since beginning his overture a month before the Winter Olympics in South Korea, he has been awarded a meeting with President Xi Jinping of China, who had earlier treated him with thinly disguised contempt. He was welcomed by Mr. Moon with a South Korean honor guard. **And he is on the verge of something once inconceivable: a meeting with the American president.**

>Though Mr. Kim made gestures of his own — a pledge not to test bombs or long-range missiles, and an end to the North’s longtime insistence that American troops withdraw from the peninsula — **he has not made any tangible concessions on his nuclear weapons. The language in his joint statement with Mr. Moon about denuclearization was both vague and familiar to veterans of past negotiations with North Korea.**

>“He’s gotten all these meetings with world leaders **without making any concessions**,” said Jung H. Pak, a former C.I.A. analyst who is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center for East Asia Policy Studies. “So far, everything has been no-cost for Kim.”

Okay, petty correction aside. He's been threatening KJU for months and it has had no effect on how KJU is acting or what he is doing. The only thing that has changed is that he is no longer actively threatening military action.

>he has intellectual consistency.

He absolutely does not. Paul has made a spectacle of opposing Trump on supposedly principled grounds every now and then and has ended up caving to Herr Twitler every single time. Paul is nothing but another spineless empty suit who uses his supposedly principled libertarianism to justify his family's well documented racism while towing the Trump line nearly 100% of the time.
---
He's absolutely toeing the Trump line. Like when he raised a stink over the massive deficits which were predicted to be incurred due to the tax scam (now proven true) and after a quick phone call he was back on the Trump Train, voting for a bill which flew in the face of his much vaunted fiscal responsibility. 

There is absolutely nothing principled about Rand Paul. He's just another self promoting career politician feeding off the public perception his father cultivated, who, for all his horrendously awful views, actually DID have intellectual consistency.

It’s not a threat anymore because of the “beautiful letter” and the summit they had and the coin they minted. Trump has to build lies, even easily disprovable ones, on top of his old ones.

So it was ok for Trump to bow and scrape before Chairman Kim, but when President Moon Jae-in tries diplomacy and engagement it's the sign of a rift? 

Sometimes it feels like the media wants nothing more than war with the DPRK. Yes, Trump's policies are the incoherent detritus of a syphilitic mind, but that doesn't mean the only option for the rest of the world is escalation.

That view is shared by many in Congress and the American intelligence agencies.

It's almost like Trump is bad at deals and has no clue what he even signed in Singapore.

For once, I'm actually *hoping* Trump knew North Korea wasn't actually denuclearizing and he just lied about it, instead of him being so incredibly ignorant that he truly believed what he was saying.

TITLE: Pompeo: North Korea remains a nuclear threat

COMMENTS:
Trump's Korea summit was an unmitigated failure. The soldiers who gave their lives protecting South Korea would not have wanted their bodies used as a trading tool to prop up a totalitarian state.
---
And here I thought Trump said we had "we can sleep tonight". 

The summit was a charade, which is what it was always going to be from the very beginning. Trump made it clear he wasn't in it for the long haul when he repeatedly said he didn't need extra time to prepare for their meeting. The meeting cost Americans millions of dollars to fly Trump to Asia and to fly him back home. 

If Trump had been serious in negotiating then he would have spent a week with Kim and their diplomats in laying down a framework that preserved whatever leverage America still had over North Korea. 

Diplomacy is a marathon, not a sprint.

If "grab 'em by the pussy" didn't haunt him, this won't either.  His supporters simply don't care about truth, facts, lies, or decency - as long as he keeps hurting liberals and/or immigrants, they're cool with literally anything he says or does.

No mention in this thread yet? Trump says if he turns out to be wrong on Kim Jong-un:

COMMENTS:
President Donald Trump declared that North Korea no longer posed a nuclear threat, even though Kim Jong Un hasn’t committed to a timetable for giving up his regime’s weapons.

“Everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office,” Trump said on Twitter Wednesday shortly after arriving back in Washington from his meetings in Singapore with Kim. “There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.”

Let me get this straight. Our allies told Trump that his data and information was wrong regarding his understanding of the tarriff issue. He agrees to  joint resolution but as he high tails it out of the G7 summit he renigs on the US commitment citing that our allies were playing the US. 

All around good guy Kim Jun Un, tells Trump they will denuclearize and thats all he needs to believe it.

 this is so fucking stupid

"Mission Accomplished"  moment?

That is the problem with Trump and his goddamn supporters. 

Let's face it, the world is complicated, there are a lot of problems that really smart people who spent decades working on couldn't solve. Lazy people don't want to think too hard about the complications to those problems and just offers the simplest solution possible that everyone has already thought of.

On the campaign, Trump just rants on and on about all these problems, claims he alone can fix it, offers the most simplest solution, and his supporters buy it. It is so fucking stupid!

Economy sucks? Blame globalism, or the deep state elites, or Mexicans. Middle East is complicated? Just nuke the Muslims and propose a travel ban. Rampant homelessness? Well why don't they get jobs? Healthcare? Well who knew it would be so goddamn complicated.

North Korea being a rogue state??

Well let's meet in Singapore, shake hands, have a 30 min talk, prepare for some photo ops, and boom just like that, 70 years of deadlock is gone!

TITLE: North Korea's nuclear threat is nothing compared to its cyber warfare capabilities

COMMENTS:
Except they do. And have been doing this for years.

One of their main sources of income is hacking banking institutions and stealing cryptocurrency. They were also behind the WannaCry attack a few years ago.

Surprisingly, NK has some of the best hackers in the world.
---
Exactly. There is no reason to use nukes now. Cyberwarfare is the 50s nukes. In that, they are more effective at negotiations and obtaining the needs from other countries.
---
>A nuclear attack against the United States by North Korea would be “one and done”, while a cyber attack by North Korea is the gift that keeps on giving for Kim Jong Un. The former was never really a reality in our lifetime. But the latter is happening even as both nations prepare for the June 12 summit in Singapore.

>The lack of a specific doctrine in cyber warfare has plagued policymakers for years. In April, President Trump finally sent a report to Congress on U.S. policy for deterring and responding to attacks in the fifth domain — cyberspace. We’ve had a nuclear doctrine for decades, and now our cyber warfare doctrine is starting to evolve and mature.

It's not to say deterring nuclear war or proliferation of nuclear weapons is less important, but we've been under constant, consistent cyber attack for years by NK, Russia, Iran, China, and others.

I don't think I agree with Hillary that a cyber attack warrants a conventional attack in response, but I think there should be a retaliation policy other than sanctions since.... clearly those aren't working.

COMMENTS:
I think that in the giant clusterfuck that has been the last two years of this administration, we've sort of lost sight of how just how earth-shatteringly insane this entire thing is.

The President actually refuses to believe his own national intelligence apparatus (easily the most comprehensive, expensive, and massive information gathering juggernaut in history) and instead chooses to believe the word of the leader of the very same rival nation found to be responsible for the cyber-attacks on the country.

Unbelievable doesn't even begin to describe it. It's truly without precedent and just....batshit insane.

Can you imagine if FDR had gone before Congress and said "December 7th 1941 is a day that will live in infamy, but not because the Japanese attacked us. I just got off the phone with Hirohito and he told me they weren't even near Hawaii, so don't worry, it's not them."

TITLE: Trump Could Give Away America’s Most Valuable Bargaining Chip With North Korea

COMMENTS:
Look at a map.

 See where Russia is.

 Understand why Trump wants to remove our military presence from NK[..er SK].
---
Who needs chips? Especially  now that Kim has reformed and is a nice guy who totally doesn't torture or murder people anymore and has some good coastal development land.
---
I think they might've changed the article's title.
---
Russia and North Korea share a border and a very good relationship.
---
It is already known that Russia and probably China has been providing technical support and actual hardware to further and accelerate NK's Missile and Nuclear weapons programs. Believing that they do not have the capability of mounting a warhead on a missile that has a functioning guidance system is naive.

TITLE: Trump nearly tweeted America into war with North Korea, Bob Woodward says

COMMENTS:
Why would anyone honestly doubt this? Does Donald Trump have some sort of reputable track record for logical well thought out tweets?
---
Woodward is a reputable journalist who generally doesn't publish things without having evidence to back it up.  He is known to use a tape recorder *a lot* and has established his track record for decades.  Why should I believe you over him?


Edit:  To be clear, if you provide some sort of argument that is greater than just "nu-uh", I can totally be convinced that his never happened.  It wouldn't even take that much.
---
>‘We are going to pull our dependents from South Korea — family members of the 28,000 people there'


Which would make the NKs think that an attack was imminent.  I am not sure why Trump would want to pull all the dependents out though?  He might just enjoy moving people around like they are pieces on a chess board...
---
"Fear" is certainly an apt description of what I will be feeling when I read the book. I cannot wait to see his interview with Colbert tonight.
---
And does Bob Woodward have anything to gain by lying? 

Like, Woodward has everything (reputation-wise) to lose by lying… trump himself once tweeted [Only the Obama WH can get away with attacking Bob Woodward.](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/307582196196188160)

---
Yeah, I tagged them as having a Hillary Fetish.

I’ll be more optimistic if they sign a treaty, or if North Korea actually sticks to these talks which they have been known to be not the most trustworthy on in previous discussions. Still, a big step in hopefully the right direction
---
I am in no way convinced this was a "step away from war." We have now empowered Kim, emboldened him, and given him more influence in the region. He was never going to launch an attack in the first place, and now we have simply set things up to encourage a confrontation between the US and NK all over again--if Trump in fact promised to lift sanctions in that little private meeting, that is insane. If he didn't, he is going to have to call Kim a liar, and we are off to the races.

POST: Sarah Sanders has confirmed that Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un will meet in February at a location to be confirmed at a later date.

This is being reported by [Axios](https://www.axios.com/second-trump-kim-summit-february-c83f07eb-4620-4db8-a706-7722a0a3f528.html) as well as the Voice of America, which was picked up by [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2019/1/18/18186799/north-korea-trump-kim-summit-nuclear).

President Trump held the first ever meeting between a US President and North Korea in [June of 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_North_Korea%E2%80%93United_States_summit). This will be the second meeting between Kim Jon Un and Trump.

There has been reporting that [North Korea has little intention of dismantling their nuclear weapons program](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/us/politics/north-korea-missile-bases.html) because they continue to made improvements to their existing facilities.

We need to keep in mind that the first summit released a Joint Statement, neither country is bound by formal treaty to the content therein.

Long story short, it's a mixed bag of progress with the Joint Statement objectives along with NK continuing with their pre-Summit initiatives.

In regards to confirmed progress on specific objectives in the Joint Statement

* NK destroyed an ICBM facility near Pyongyang

* NK dismantled an atomic testing site near Sohae

* NK began returning remains of US soldiers killed In the Korean War

* NK cancelled domestic anti-American propaganda programs

* NK released three American citizens being held captive

* The USA cancelled their yearly joint-military exercises with SK

As with much information in the Trump era the data often seems to be presented in a manner meant to convey a narrative.

> [NBC News - NK has increased Nuclear Production](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/north-korea-has-increased-nuclear-production-secret-sites-say-u-n887926)

While the report is factually correct that enrichment was occurring, the logistic planning would have long predated the summit proposals and may not have been able to be suspended.

[NYT - Missile Bases Suggest a Great Deception](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/us/politics/north-korea-missile-bases.html)

The NYT published a report that 16 sites were still being developed. The sites were acknowledged as already being known by both the US and SK governments. 


[NBC - SK President "Nothing New in NYT report"](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/south-korea-says-nothing-new-report-identifying-north-korean-bases-n935541)

The extent of development at one site was the renovation of two building rooftops reportedly on hospitality suites for future possible inspectors.

> North Korea has imposed a moratorium on missile tests and nuclear tests. It has dismantled entrances to a nuclear test site (at Punggye-ri) and a satellite-launching site (at Sohae). 

> There’s evidence of a shutdown of an I.C.B.M.-assembly facility near Pyongyang. It has returned what it says are the remains of 55 United States soldiers killed during the Korean War and has released three American citizens arrested in North Korea as a condition for the summit meeting. Pyongyang has also reduced domestic anti-American propaganda.

> The United States has canceled one war game.

> All of North Korea’s concessions were unthinkable less than a year ago. It’s clear that Pyongyang is willing to move toward reducing tensions. 

> A United States commander in South Korea, Gen. Vincent Brooks, noted recently that the North has gone more than 200 days “without a provocation,” and that he had seen a slowdown in the operating tempo of North Korean armed forces.

TITLE: What are the historical implications of the Trump/Kim Summit as it relates to denuclearization and the halting of joint-military exercises?

POST: This morning it was announced that Kim Jung-Un would commit to ["complete denuclearization"](https://nypost.com/2018/06/12/kim-jong-un-commits-to-complete-denuclearization-of-the-korean-peninsula-document/) as part of a joint-document he signed with Donald Trump. In return, the United States would halt [joint-military exercises with South Korea](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/world/asia/trump-military-exercises-north-south-korea.html). It should be mentioned that Kim had [already pledged denuclearization](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/27/606264786/peace-at-hand-korean-leaders-meet-for-historic-border-handshake) back in April with a meeting with South Korea's leader.

As a result, many people have pointed out that historically, [Kim has made similar pledges but backed out on them.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/09/asia/north-korean-denuclearization-promises/index.html) 

I have several questions as it relates to this summit.

1) What makes this pledge from Kim different from previous pledges?

2) If Kim backs out on his pledge, and we no longer have troops in South Korea, what are our options from a geopolitical standpoint?

3) Is the document signed by Kim and Trump a document of substance, or a document for the media? Is there anything binding in that document that holds each nation to it's pledges?

COMMENTS:
In regards to your 1), there have been several previous agreements with North Korea regarding denuclearization:

* [1992 Joint Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Declaration_of_the_Denuclearization_of_the_Korean_Peninsula)
* [Agreed Framework of 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreed_Framework)
* [Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks 2005 - 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-party_talks)



There is a consistent pattern in which North Korea will pledge to do something, only to backtrack soon afterwards. The most recent example of this is probably back in 2012. North Korea had pledged to halt pursuing nuclear and missile technology research in exchange for food relief. A couple months later, North Korea launched a "satellite" using ICBM related technology. Other countries, including the U.S., protested, which led to the U.S. cancelling food relief efforts to North Korea.


Each presidential administration has made a go at peace talks with North Korea. And each time, the U.S. has gotten burned when North Korea decides not to adhere to the agreement. 


EDIT: I have been barraged by a number of replies that have been promoting the idea of Kim Jong-un as a 'young reformative leader'. Please make no mistake about this, Kim Jong-un is a monster who has murdered dissidents and even members of his own family in order to stay in power. He is directly responsible for thousands of deaths of innocent people. He is continuing on the horrific legacy of his father, and there are no signs that he is trying to reduce these atrocities that are on par with the Holocaust.


I urge you to [listen](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/04/13/inside-north-korea-concentration-camp.html) and [read](https://www.amazon.com/Long-Road-Home-Testimony-Survivor/dp/0231147473) testimony from the North Korean gulag survivors to find out the horrors that exist there. 

I would also urge you to upvote /u/glassjar1 's post, as they have a much more detailed and thoughtout explanation for the North Korean situation that my admittedly amateurish examinations have lacked.

As someone who has studied the Korean peninsula for over thirty years as a Korean linguist, intelligence analyst, and now, HS history teacher, I have to say that such an agreement without clear details is unprecedented and historic in a very concerning way.

The full text of the agreement:
Joint Statement of President Donald J. Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the Singapore Summit

President Donald J. Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) held a first, historic summit in Singapore on June 12, 2018.

President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un conducted a comprehensive, in-depth, and sincere exchange of opinions on the issues related to the establishment of new U.S.-DPRK relations and the building of a lasting and robust peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. President Trump committed to provide security guarantees to the DPRK, and Chairman Kim Jong Un reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

Convinced that the establishment of new U.S.-DPRK relations will contribute to the peace and prosperity of the Korean Peninsula and of the world, and recognizing that mutual confidence building can promote the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un state the following:

The United States and the DPRK commit to establish new U.S.-DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity.
The United States and the DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.

Reaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, the DPRK commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

The United States and the DPRK commit to recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified.

Having acknowledged that the U.S.-DPRK summit — the first in history — was an epochal event of great significance in overcoming decades of tensions and hostilities between the two countries and for the opening up of a new future, President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un commit to implement the stipulations in this joint statement fully and expeditiously. The United States and the DPRK commit to hold follow-on negotiations, led by the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and a relevant high-level DPRK official, at the earliest possible date, to implement the outcomes of the U.S.-DPRK summit.

President Donald J Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have committed to cooperate for the development of new U.S.-DPRK relations and for the promotion of peace, prosperity, and security of the Korean Peninsula and of the world.
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/12/full-text-of-the-trump-kim-summit-agreement.html
 
This is long on ideals yet completely lacks **any** plan of how or when anyone has commited to fulfill promises or how anyone will verify compliance.  

What has been publicly released is contrary to Mike Pompeo's [insistence that whatever came out of negotiations would be Complete, Verifiable, Irreversible](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/06/617619192/complete-verifiable-irreversible-a-tough-goal-for-north-korea-summit).  The parties promise to 'join efforts' [for peace], 'work toward denuclearization' and recover POW/MIA remains and no more.  The agreement lays out no plan on how any of this will be accomplished.

There has been a long road of negotiation toward denuclearization and it has been marked by serious plans, aid, and agreements that allow some verification.  Despite these long term efforts, denuclearization has not happened.  This agreement does not appear to change or address any of this.

An example of past negotiations:
(This is really an arbitrary selection of events in a long history of negotiations.  An abbreviated but extensive chronology is available here: https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron)

1985 NK signs nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  Then later suggests it will only adhere to treaty only if US withdraws nukes from SK.

1991: President George Bush withdraws all nuclear weapons from overseas including on the Korean Peninsula.

92: SK/NK sign denuclearization pact.  Then US imposes sanctions for continued NK missile proliferation.  IAEA inspections begin.

93: Reasonable suspicion of continued atomic development declared by IAEA.  NK threatens to withdraw from nonproliferation treaty (NPT), then changes it's mind.

94: US Intel believes that NK has succeeded in producing nuclear weapons.

This pattern of negotiate, agree, renege, attempt to renegotiate, develop weapons, test weapons continues right up to today.  Deals are made, and broken.
https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron

As a gesture of goodwill before this negotiation, NK 'gave up' a nuclear test site that was already [unusable.] 
(https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/26/north-korea-nuclear-test-site-collapse-may-be-out-of-action-china)  There is no reason to believe that this is anything but business as usual, and we've already granted NK a free political victory by the way negotiations were handled this time.

A couple of longterm goals of NK were met and granted in this meeting without really giving anything up:

1. Prestige and Legitimacy: a one on one meeting with the president of the U.S.
2. Commitment to end joint exercises with an ally. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/world/asia/trump-military-exercises-north-south-korea.html

I'd like to see this succeed, but am very skeptical.

TLDR: It is historic, but not in a good way.  

Edit: additional info and sources

> Each presidential administration has made a go at peace talks with North Korea. And each time, the U.S. has gotten burned when North Korea decides not to adhere to the agreement.

Is there any indication the current administration has taken any safeguards if Kim decides to backtrack?
---
The difference is normally the denuclearize deals come with some concessions from the United States. So far we have not lifted sanctions, we have not moved troops out of the country and have not agreed to any cash incentives. The one concession that we have made is we agreed to stop joint military missions with South Korea if NK denuclearizes. Our next joint mission is next year anyways so if Kim reneges on his agreement, we can still have the missions quickly.   

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/06/12/trump\-suspend\-military\-exercises\-south\-korea/693527002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/06/12/trump-suspend-military-exercises-south-korea/693527002/)

Because of the lack of concessions, this is different as of now.

Deleted comments were asking "how exactly is this just having the meeting already a concession?"  Which is a common question.  

> Abraham Denmark, director of the Wilson Center's Asia programme, predicted: "Kim will accomplish the dream of his father and grandfather by making North Korea a nuclear state, *and gain tremendous prestige and legitimacy by meeting with an American President as an equal*. 

>"All without giving up a single warhead or missile."

That second part is the "diplomatic victory" that having the meeting represents.   To explain why that may be the case, I'll use an analogy that was used on me.  Then respond to that.

**Not a perfect analogy**, because nations aren't businesses.  But it's like if I have a grievance with Disney, because I've been blatantly plagiarizing their material.  My business model is to steal their latest concept and exploit some third world schlubs to rush it to Amazon to ride on Disney's marketing blitz.  

Rather than having some paralegal send me a Cease and Desist letter, I manage to negotiate to have a public, high profile meeting with the CEO to discuss the issue.  

It doesn't matter if I get all the concessions I want, or in fact _any_.  The fact that I sat down with Bob Iger on the news legitimizes my otherwise garbage, shady-ass business.  It's a big enough win that I'm very happy regardless of the outcome of the meeting.   My standing in all future ventures, disputes,  court cases, etc will be improved now that Disney has tacitly agreed that I'm on equal footing with them.

The NK situation departs from this in a couple of key ways, 1) they are a sovereign nation with a military who isn't going away, and 2) there are real people who are living there and suffering greatly under both isolation imposed by the regime and sanctions from outside.  Direct talks could lead to easing of both.  

Both Trump and the [Obama Administration](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/24/AR2007072401534_pf.html?noredirect=on) favored having direct talks with North Korea, on the basis that it's a way to get change started.  They cited Nixon oing to China and Reagan's directly meeting with the USSR.   Clinton departed from Obama policy on this, saying "I don't want to be used for propaganda purposes."
