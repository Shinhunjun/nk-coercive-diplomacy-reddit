-Goal-
Given a Reddit post or comment about North Korea in the context of US-DPRK diplomacy (2017-2019), identify all relevant entities and relationships. This analysis supports research on how public discourse shifted around the Singapore Summit (2018-06) and Hanoi Summit (2019-02).

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities

**Entity Type Guidelines:**
- PERSON: Political leaders, officials, diplomats (e.g., Kim Jong Un, Trump, Moon Jae-in, Pompeo)
- COUNTRY: Nations involved (e.g., North Korea, USA, South Korea, China, Japan)
- EVENT: Diplomatic events, summits, meetings, tests (e.g., Singapore Summit, Hanoi Summit, ICBM test)
- ORGANIZATION: Government agencies, international bodies, military (e.g., CIA, UN, IAEA, Pentagon)
- WEAPON: Military capabilities, weapons systems (e.g., ICBM, nuclear weapon, Hwasong-15)
- POLICY: Diplomatic approaches, sanctions, agreements (e.g., denuclearization, maximum pressure, sanctions)

Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score (1-10) indicating strength of the relationship

**Relationship Type Guidelines:**
- Diplomatic relationships: summits, negotiations, agreements (higher strength 7-10)
- Threat/conflict relationships: military actions, sanctions, hostile rhetoric (higher strength 7-10)
- Policy relationships: implementing, opposing, or affected by policies (medium strength 5-7)
- General associations: less direct connections (lower strength 1-4)

Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}
